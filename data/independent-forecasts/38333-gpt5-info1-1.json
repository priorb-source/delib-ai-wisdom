  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to “explore” but does not make a formal public announcement before July 1, possibly waiting for later in 2025 or choosing not to run at all, especially given the Trump-backed Byron Donalds already in the race.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez holds a press conference or releases a clear public statement or social media post announcing he’s running for Florida governor before July 1, 2025 (or otherwise makes an unequivocal announcement picked up by major media).",
    "rationale": "- Time window: With only about 26 days left, the base rate for a high-profile candidate moving from “weighing” to an official announcement within this short window is modest.\n- Competitive context: According to the research assistant, Byron Donalds has already launched and secured Trump’s endorsement. This is a strong deterrent in a Florida GOP primary, lowering Suarez’s near-term announcement incentive. Other potential Republicans (Casey DeSantis, Matt Gaetz, Jeanette Nuñez) may also be assessing the field, which could make Suarez more cautious about jumping in quickly.\n- Status quo weight: No announcement has occurred as of June 5. In most cycles, many politicians who are “weighing” a run do not announce on a tight timeline unless they’ve visibly built infrastructure. Absent clear signs of imminent action, the status quo (No announcement) deserves extra weight.\n- Why not higher: Limited time left; presence of a Trump-endorsed candidate; no widely reported signs (e.g., staff hires, scheduled launch events, statewide swing) pointing to an imminent June announcement.\n- Why not lower: The Axios report (May 2) indicates real consideration. Mid-2025 is a plausible announcement window for a 2026 race, and Suarez could want to stake out space before other heavyweights decide. There’s also a fundraising optics incentive to announce before the end of Q2 to show a strong report.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of Suarez hiring key campaign staff, reserving venues, statewide travel for an announcement tour, a filed committee, or leaks to major outlets that an announcement is imminent in June. That could push me into the 30–45% range.\n- What would move me down: Public signals of deferral, an endorsement of Donalds, negative developments that make a run less likely, or reports that he’ll wait until late summer/fall. That could drop me toward 5–10%.",

If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
