    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the outcome is determined on or after July 1, 2025, and today's date is May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website Climate.gov is currently online and operational. The default expectation is that a major government agency website will continue to be maintained and remain accessible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome could result from a sudden policy directive from the executive branch to take down climate-related information portals, similar to concerns raised during previous administrations. Alternatively, a major, unresolved technical failure, a successful cyberattack, or a lapse in appropriations leading to a government shutdown could render the site inaccessible on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome, representing the status quo, occurs if NOAA continues its operations as usual. The site remains funded, technically maintained, and politically supported through July 1, 2025, experiencing no major disruptions that would take it offline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Major government websites like Climate.gov, run by a key scientific agency like NOAA, possess significant institutional inertia and are not typically taken offline without a lengthy and public process. The base rate for such a site remaining online over a one-month period is extremely high. The primary risk factor, as highlighted by the question's background material, is political interference. However, as of May 21, 2025, we are several months into the presidential term that began in January 2025. Any administration intending to take such a drastic and high-profile action as removing Climate.gov would likely have signaled or initiated this process already. The absence of such information suggests the site is not under immediate threat from this vector. Other risks, such as a prolonged technical outage, a successful cyberattack, or a government shutdown, are possible but have a low probability of occurring and persisting precisely on the resolution date. My forecast is not higher than 98% to account for these low-probability but non-zero risks. An unexpected political directive or a 'black swan' technical event could still occur. My forecast is not lower because the bar for removing a major, established scientific resource is very high, and the short time frame remaining until resolution makes the materialization of any known or unknown risks highly unlikely. I would lower my forecast upon credible reports of specific political directives targeting the site or if a new, prolonged government shutdown becomes imminent. I would raise it if the administration explicitly affirmed its commitment to maintaining the website.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
