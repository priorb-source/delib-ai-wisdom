    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 30%, which suggests either strong convergent reasoning or potential anchoring. Key insights from others: Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about Keep_Track's reputation for thorough documentation, suggesting they likely use rigorous criteria for 'Done' status - this is significant because it would make reaching 120 harder. Forecaster 3 provides valuable specificity on procedural requirements like notice-and-comment periods for regulatory changes, which I underweighted. Both forecasters emphasize that the total number of objectives in the tracker matters significantly - if there are 500+ objectives, 120 represents only ~24%, which might be more achievable. However, none of us have access to the current count, which is the single most critical piece of information. We're all essentially forecasting blind, relying on general principles about policy implementation timelines. The convergence at 30% likely reflects shared uncertainty rather than strong evidence for this specific number.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my 30% forecast. The key factors remain: (1) Lack of current baseline data - without knowing if we're at 20, 60, or 100 objectives already marked Done, forecasting is highly speculative; (2) Time constraints - with only ~46 days remaining and a ~5 month total window, achieving 120 Done objectives requires sustained rapid implementation; (3) Procedural barriers - as Forecaster 3 emphasized, many policy changes require notice-and-comment periods, face legal challenges, or need congressional action, all of which take months or years; (4) Criteria strictness - Forecaster 2's point about Keep_Track's rigorous documentation standards suggests 'Done' likely means substantive implementation, not just announcements or executive orders; (5) Offsetting factor - if Project 2025 contains 500+ objectives, 120 represents a modest completion rate that's more plausible. The convergence among forecasters doesn't necessarily validate 30% as correct, but it does suggest this represents a reasonable middle ground given extreme uncertainty. I would significantly update upward (to 60-70%) if current count exceeds 90, or downward (to 10-15%) if current count is below 40.",
