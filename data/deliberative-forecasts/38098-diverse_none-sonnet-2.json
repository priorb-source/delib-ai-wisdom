    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly in the 10-14% range, reflecting strong consensus on the core reasoning: the short 32-day timeframe, absence of preparatory signals, and strong status quo bias. Forecaster 2 and I share nearly identical logic emphasizing the lack of observable campaign infrastructure. Forecaster 3 raises a valuable point I hadn't weighted heavily: the Q2 fundraising deadline on June 30 could create a tactical incentive for a late-June announcement to capture early donor momentum or start fresh in Q3. This is a legitimate consideration that could produce a minor spike in announcement probability in the final days before July 1. However, this argument is somewhat weakened by the fact that we're already at May 30 with no public signals - if Norman were planning to leverage the Q2 deadline strategically, we would expect to see preliminary mobilization by now (staff contacts, donor outreach, venue bookings). The complete absence of such indicators suggests either no announcement is planned for this timeframe, or any announcement would come after July 1. Forecaster 3's point about early announcements deterring rivals is valid but applies more to announcing in summer/fall 2025 generally rather than specifically before July 1.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that my original reasoning was sound. The consensus range of 10-14% reflects appropriate uncertainty given the constraints. Forecaster 3's Q2 deadline argument adds marginal probability - perhaps 1-2 percentage points - but doesn't fundamentally change the calculus because we're so close to the deadline without observable preparation. If Norman were positioning for a June 30 fundraising-timed announcement, we would likely see leaks, staff activity, or scheduling of a 'major announcement' by now. The continued silence as we enter the final month is evidence against an imminent declaration. My forecast remains balanced: high enough to account for the possibility of a surprise announcement or rapid decision-making in the final weeks, but low enough to respect the strong empirical pattern that major campaign launches are preceded by visible groundwork. The tight clustering of all three forecasts validates this approach.",
