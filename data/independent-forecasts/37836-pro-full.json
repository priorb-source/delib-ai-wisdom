  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of late May 2025, the tracker at flightsfrom.com/EBL lists 30 direct flight destinations from Erbil. This is not greater than the threshold of 31.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of direct destinations remains at 31 or fewer by the resolution date. This occurs if no new routes are added, or if any new routes (e.g., one new European capital) are offset by the suspension of existing seasonal or low-demand routes, resulting in a net increase of one or zero.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number of direct destinations reaches 32 or more. This is driven by a combination of factors: the airport's recent upgrades and successful ICAO inspection attract new carriers, and the start of the summer 2025 travel season prompts multiple airlines to launch new scheduled routes to previously unserved European or regional hubs.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current number of destinations being very close to the threshold, balanced against the short time remaining for a significant change. The status quo, with 30 destinations, is a strong prior, and a net increase of two routes in just over a month is a notable change. The research indicates a strong positive momentum for air travel in Erbil. The airport's infrastructure improvements (night flights) and its pursuit of ICAO certification are significant steps that increase its attractiveness to international airlines. Furthermore, the addition of carriers like Aegean Airlines and Eurowings, even on existing routes, points to growing demand. However, the provided intelligence does not confirm any new *destinations* that are not already served; it mainly points to increased flight frequency or more carriers on existing routes (e.g., Athens, Cologne). While the summer season is a likely time for new routes to be announced and launched, the lead time for such launches can be longer than the five weeks remaining until the resolution date. Therefore, I place the probability slightly below 50%. My forecast is not lower because the positive signals are strong and the threshold is close; a couple of quick route additions for the summer season are entirely plausible. My forecast is not higher because of the short timeframe and the lack of specific announcements for at least two new, previously unserved destinations. I would increase my forecast upon seeing a credible announcement of a new route starting before July 1. I would decrease it if any existing routes were suspended or if regional instability escalated.",
