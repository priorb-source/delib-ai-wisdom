  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the arrest of one MEP and investigations into others, all implicated members of the European Parliament choose to retain their seats while fighting the allegations. Following the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, their political groups may suspend them but do not succeed in forcing a formal resignation from the Parliament itself before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under immense political pressure from their party and the public following the arrest and ongoing investigation, at least one of the implicated MEPs announces their resignation. This could be the arrested MEP finding their position untenable, or another member resigning after their parliamentary immunity is lifted during the mid-June plenary session.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the significant political pressure created by the arrest of a sitting MEP, Fulvio Martusciello, in connection with the Huawei lobbying scandal. An arrest is a major escalation that makes an MEP's position politically and practically untenable. The major political groups, including Martusciello's EPP, have publicly stated a 'zero-tolerance' policy on corruption, creating a strong incentive for them to force a resignation to limit reputational damage. With the process to lift the immunity of four other MEPs set to conclude in mid-June, there are multiple individuals under extreme pressure, increasing the likelihood that at least one will resign before July 1.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of the strong precedent from the 'Qatargate' scandal, where implicated MEPs were suspended from their parliamentary groups but, in most cases, did not resign their actual seats in the immediate aftermath. The personal incentive to retain one's salary, benefits, and position is substantial, even under immense pressure.\n\nMy probability is not lower because an arrest is a more severe event than simply being named in an investigation. It is very difficult to perform parliamentary duties from a jail cell, adding a practical layer of pressure on top of the political one. The fact that five MEPs are simultaneously under scrutiny increases the chances of at least one resignation.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the EPP leadership publicly calls for Martusciello's resignation from Parliament, not just his suspension from the group. I would decrease it if the implicated MEPs release defiant statements and their political groups indicate that suspension is the extent of the action they will take.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
