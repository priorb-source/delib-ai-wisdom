    "review": "My initial forecast was 99%, heavily anchored on a specific and recent statement from a NOAA spokesperson guaranteeing the site would remain online. I viewed the risk of failure as minimal, limited to unforeseen technical or extreme political events. The other forecasters introduced crucial context and evidence I had overlooked. Forecaster 2's point about the recent decommissioning of the 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database provides a concrete example of the administration's willingness to remove climate data, directly challenging the reliability of the spokesperson's assurance. Forecaster 3 provided even broader context, citing budget cuts, layoffs, and a connection to 'Project 2025,' which suggests a systematic political motive to dismantle NOAA's climate functions. Both arguments convincingly demonstrate that the political risk is far more significant and immediate than I had assessed. They correctly argue that while inertia is strong, there is demonstrated political will to act.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial 99% forecast overweighted the statement from the NOAA spokesperson and failed to account for the demonstrated actions and political motives of the current administration. The evidence presented by the other forecasters—specifically the recent decommissioning of a major climate database and the broader pattern of budget cuts and layoffs at NOAA—is compelling. These actions show a clear precedent and intent that a spokesperson's statement cannot override. Taking down Climate.gov is no longer a hypothetical 'black swan' event but a plausible action in line with a stated political agenda. However, I am not lowering my forecast as far as Forecaster 3's 75%. The primary counterargument remains the extremely short timeframe of approximately 40 days. Taking down a major public-facing domain like Climate.gov, while symbolic, would be highly visible and controversial, and would likely encounter bureaucratic and technical friction. A 10% chance of failure within this short window seems to appropriately balance the powerful force of institutional inertia against the very real and demonstrated political risk. Therefore, I am revising my forecast from 99% down to 90%.",
