    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core legal and timing barriers and add a useful nuance I underweighted: there is no pre–July 1 deadline pressure. If an October 26 election were the plan, the 90‑day requirement implies a latest scheduling date around July 28—still during martial law—so announcing before July 1 carries no special procedural benefit. They also stress that only the Rada can set the date, and a fresh extension to Aug 6 signals against early lifting. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with available signals. The tail scenarios they cite (early lifting, rapid legal amendment, coordinated political push) are plausible but low‑probability in a ~6‑week window.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Martial law was just extended to Aug 6, and current law forbids scheduling national elections under martial law. The body with authority (Verkhovna Rada) would therefore need either to lift martial law early or to amend the legal framework before July 1 to lawfully announce a date. Official denials of July plans reduce the likelihood of a surprise move. The 90‑day lead time further weakens any incentive to act before July 1; even an Oct 26 target could, in theory, be addressed later (though still problematic under martial law). Tail paths to Yes exist—e.g., a rapid legal amendment allowing scheduling during martial law, or an unexpected early termination of martial law followed by swift scheduling—but those require coordinated, on‑record political action that we have no current signs of, especially one day after extending martial law. Given this, I’m lowering my estimate to reflect the lack of pre–July 1 urgency and the fresh extension signal against imminent change.",
