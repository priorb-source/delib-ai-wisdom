    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the same core logic: the term 'blockade' carries enormous legal and political weight (essentially an act of war), and the US has historically avoided using it even during major crises like 1995-1996. Forecaster 3 and I essentially agree (7% vs 8%), while Forecaster 2 is notably higher at 15%. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I hadn't explicitly considered: Taiwan's May 20, 2025 inauguration (just 14 days away) is a known flashpoint where China typically stages major drills. This is a concrete near-term trigger event. Forecaster 2 makes valid points about miscalculation risk and the difficulty of avoiding 'blockade' terminology if China sustains actual interdiction of commercial shipping. However, I find their 15% somewhat high because it requires multiple unlikely steps: (1) China escalating from simulation to actual sustained interdiction in the next 8 weeks, and (2) the US breaking its historical pattern of diplomatic restraint to use the specific term 'blockade' rather than softer alternatives like 'coercive activities' or even 'de facto blockade.' The base rate of such dramatic escalations in short timeframes is low, and even Forecaster 2 acknowledges the US has incentives for caution given its 'bad trajectory' assessment vis-à-vis China.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the May 20 inauguration is genuinely important new information that increases near-term risk slightly. Beijing has consistently used Taiwan inaugurations as occasions for military pressure, and we're only 14 days away. However, even if China stages aggressive drills around that date, the question still hinges on whether the US would break its historical pattern and use the specific term 'blockade.' The 1995-1996 precedent remains powerful - the US avoided that terminology even during a major crisis. Additionally, the US currently has strong incentives for diplomatic restraint: ongoing talks in Shanghai, concerns about being on a 'bad trajectory' militarily, and the massive escalatory implications of a blockade accusation. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point about tail risk from miscalculation, I think the convergence between Forecaster 3 and my original analysis is more compelling. The extremely high threshold for using 'blockade' terminology, combined with the short 56-day timeframe, strongly favors the status quo continuing. I'll nudge up slightly from 8% to 10% to account for the May 20 trigger point and the non-zero tail risk of dramatic escalation, but I don't find sufficient evidence to move toward 15%.",
