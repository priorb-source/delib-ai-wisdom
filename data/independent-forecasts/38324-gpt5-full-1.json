  "information": "As of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets. This figure was reported as having reached $36.216 trillion by January 2025. Estimates of the debt's growth rate vary; one source indicates it is increasing by approximately $1 trillion every 180 days, while another suggests a faster rate of over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt has grown by more than $13 trillion since 2020.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is currently using 'extraordinary measures' to continue financing the government without breaching the statutory debt limit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has informed Congress that these measures can be sustained until June 27, 2025. Separately, the Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the 'X-date,' when the government would be at risk of default, will likely occur between mid-July and early October 2025. Following the previous debt ceiling suspension in June 2023, the reported debt figure increased by approximately $360 billion on the next business day and by a total of $600 billion within one week as inter-governmental trust funds were replenished.\n\nThe federal budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, is projected to be $2.2 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican-proposed bill to cut taxes and eliminate certain programs would add an additional $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Interest payments on the debt have become one of the largest federal expenses, exceeding defense spending and projected to surpass $1 trillion annually. According to the Treasury Department, net interest expenditure for the first seven months of the 2025 fiscal year totaled $578.7 billion. In 2025, $9.2 trillion of existing U.S. debt is scheduled to mature, with $6.5 trillion of that amount coming due between January and June.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (until June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — total public debt remains around the current ceiling (~$36.2T) due to the binding debt limit and use of extraordinary measures.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congress does not raise/suspend the debt ceiling by June 27 (or does so only at the last minute), so reported Total Public Debt Outstanding stays near ~$36.2T and does not reach $37T by that date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress raises/suspends the debt ceiling by mid-June, allowing Treasury to quickly replenish extraordinary measures and rebuild the TGA; the catch-up issuance and trust fund restoration push the reported total up by ≥$800B, taking it to ≥$37T by June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: The research assistant (RA) indicates Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO) is about $36.2T in early June 2025 and has been near that level since January 2025, consistent with the debt limit binding and Treasury using extraordinary measures.\n- What must happen to reach $37T: From a ~$36.2T base, TPDO needs to rise by ≈$0.8T by June 27. Historically (e.g., June 2023), once the ceiling is lifted, reported debt jumps quickly as extraordinary measures are unwound and the TGA is rebuilt—on the order of ~$0.36T the next business day and roughly ~$0.6T within a week, with further increases thereafter as issuance continues. Hitting +$0.8T by June 27 likely requires a deal at least around mid-June to allow enough days for replenishment and bill issuance.\n- Timing incentives: The RA notes Treasury signaled extraordinary measures can last until around June 27, while the Bipartisan Policy Center’s X-date window is mid-July to early October. In most debt-limit episodes, Congress acts close to the X-date, not weeks earlier. If the true X-date risk is mid-July or later, the probability of a mid-June deal is modest. Even if a deal lands right on June 27, there may not be enough same-day time to push reported TPDO above $37T.\n- Status quo weight: With the debt limit binding, the default path is a flat TPDO near ~$36.2T. Because the world typically changes gradually, and brinkmanship tends to persist until near the X-date, I put extra weight on the status quo (No outcome).\n- RA inputs that matter: Current level (~$36.2T); pace of debt growth when unconstrained (>$1T per 100–180 days, showing rapid potential catch-up post-resolution); 2023 post-resolution jump magnitudes (~$360B next day, ~$600B in a week); and the suggested June 27 date for extraordinary measures alongside BPC’s later X-date window.\n- Why not higher: To get a Yes, we need both (1) a deal by mid-June and (2) a very fast replenishment/issuance schedule sufficient to add ~+$0.8T by June 27. Political precedent suggests deals closer to the X-date, and the mechanical catch-up typically takes more than a few days to exceed +$0.8T.\n- Why not lower: It is still plausible that a deal arrives in mid-June, and Treasury can execute a rapid T-bill issuance ramp plus restore intragovernmental balances and rebuild the TGA quickly enough to breach $37T by June 27. The 2023 episode shows large, fast jumps are feasible.\n- What would move my forecast up: (a) Credible reporting of a scheduled or imminent debt-limit suspension/raise by mid-June; (b) Treasury signaling unusually large near-term bill issuance to rebuild the TGA rapidly; (c) Evidence that TPDO is already higher than ~$36.2T (reducing the gap to $37T).\n- What would move my forecast down: (a) Clear indications negotiations are stalled with an X-date later than late June; (b) Updated guidance that extraordinary measures comfortably last into July; (c) Confirmation that June 27 data will be reported (it’s a business day) and there’s no earlier deal.\nOverall, the need for both an earlier-than-usual resolution and an unusually rapid catch-up to add ~+$0.8T by June 27 keeps the Yes probability meaningfully below 50%.",
