    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete liquidity figures (about $328M cash/restricted cash at Jan 31, 2025; Q4 operating cash burn ~$65M) that I did not explicitly incorporate. That materially lowers near-term hazard. The caveat is that the figure includes restricted cash and operating cash flow doesn’t capture all cash needs (e.g., capex, working capital swings), but the buffer still looks ample for a sub-60-day window. Forecaster 3’s reasoning aligns with my prior view on base rates and the short lead time, but offers fewer new specifics. Overall, F2’s liquidity detail is the most decision-relevant and supports a lower probability than my initial 8%.",
    "rationale": "The combination of a substantial reported cash balance at fiscal year-end (even if some is restricted) and a Q4 operating cash outflow that implies multiple quarters of runway reduces the odds of a forced filing before July 1. There are no public indicators cited of imminent covenant breach, looming maturities, advisor hires, or missed payments that typically precede a filing. While industry headwinds and execution risk remain, and unforeseen shocks are possible, the short time horizon plus liquidity cushion argue strongly for ‘No.’ I’m reducing my forecast from 8% to 4% to reflect the new liquidity detail, while keeping a small tail risk for unknown covenants, supplier term tightening, or unexpected adverse events.",
