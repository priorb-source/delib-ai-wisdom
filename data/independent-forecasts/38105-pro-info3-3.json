  "information": "Several international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Lebanon has had a Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF since April 2022 but has failed to implement the 'prior actions' required to finalize a deal due to domestic political gridlock and opposition from vested interests, particularly in the banking sector. The status quo is inaction.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon's fractured political class fails to agree on and legislate the necessary reforms, such as banking sector restructuring and capital controls, before the deadline. Despite external pressure, internal disagreements and the protection of vested interests prevent the fulfillment of the IMF's conditions, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a new agreement being announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensifying economic and social pressure, coupled with incentives like the conditional EU aid package, forces a rare political consensus. Lebanon's caretaker government and parliament fast-track a minimum set of reforms sufficient to secure a finalized agreement with the IMF. An announcement is made just before the July 1, 2025 deadline, unlocking the first tranche of financial assistance.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the persistent political stalemate that has prevented Lebanon from implementing IMF-mandated reforms for over three years since the initial Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) was reached in April 2022. The world changes slowly, and Lebanon's political gridlock is a deeply entrenched status quo. Key obstacles, such as banking sector restructuring, face powerful opposition from an elite that has a strong interest in preserving the current system. While the research assistant's report notes significant external pressure, including conditional EU aid and high-level domestic calls for a deal, these pressures have existed in various forms for years without breaking the deadlock. The timeline of just one month is extremely short for passing the complex and highly contentious legislation required. Political rhetoric, such as the finance minister's confidence, is common but has not historically translated into action. My probability is not lower than 10% because the economic situation is dire, and desperation can sometimes catalyze unexpected political breakthroughs. The linkage of the 500 million euro EU aid package specifically to an IMF deal provides a tangible and immediate incentive that might be powerful enough to force a compromise. My probability is not higher because the historical precedent of inaction and the sheer difficulty of achieving political consensus in Lebanon on painful reforms in such a short timeframe present formidable barriers. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a consensus deal between major political blocs on key reform legislation. I would decrease it if IMF officials publicly stated that talks were stalled due to lack of progress.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
