    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN List on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Interagency debate drags on or is decided against delisting due to political blowback, Ukraine war dynamics, and Congressional opposition; OFAC takes no action, so NS2 AG stays on the SDN List by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House decides to recalibrate Russia energy sanctions and directs OFAC to delist Nord Stream 2 AG—possibly as part of a broader package (e.g., energy price strategy, negotiations with European partners, or a Russia-related deal)—and OFAC publishes a delisting notice before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo is sticky. Nord Stream 2 AG has been on the SDN List since 2022, and delistings of high-profile Russia-related entities are uncommon absent clear policy shifts or ownership/control changes. Even though Politico reported on April 23, 2025 that the White House is debating lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets including Nord Stream, moving from internal debate to an executed OFAC delisting within roughly two months faces hurdles: interagency consensus, likely Congressional pushback, and ongoing geopolitical costs amid the Russia-Ukraine war. The pipeline itself is inoperable after 2022 sabotage, so delisting could be framed as low-impact—but it would still be perceived as a symbolic concession benefiting a Gazprom-controlled entity, making it politically costly. That keeps the base case as No. Why not lower: credible reporting of an active debate means a non-trivial chance the administration opts for a quick policy gesture, especially if paired with a broader energy or diplomatic package; procedurally, OFAC can delist swiftly once directed. Why not higher: strong inertia, high salience of Russia sanctions, and the very short timeline to July 1. What would move me up: clear reporting of a White House decision, Treasury/OFAC guidance signaling imminent delisting, coordinated statements from Germany/EU supporting such a move, or indications of a larger Russia-related deal including energy sanctions relief. What would move me down: reports of Congressional resistance shaping the decision, renewed Russian escalations, or leaks that the internal debate has been shelved. Research assistant found no additional info beyond the cited article; I’m weighting the long-standing SDN status and typical pace of sanctions policy over a single report of internal consideration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
