    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that was broadly aligned with my own, focusing on the same central tension: Reform UK's polling momentum versus the structural barriers of the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system and the large Conservative incumbency. No new evidence was introduced, but the key difference was in the weighting of these factors. Both forecasters arrived at a higher probability (20% and 25%) than my initial 15%. Their arguments have convinced me that I was likely underweighting the significance of the Electoral Calculus poll and the potential for an unusually deep collapse of the Conservative vote in the current political climate. Their consensus suggests the possibility of an upset is more plausible than I had initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "My core analysis remains unchanged: winning the most seats under FPTP is an incredibly difficult task for a challenger party without geographically concentrated support. The historical precedent of UKIP peaking at 17 seats and the Conservatives' 2021 majority of 57 seats are powerful anchors suggesting a 'No' outcome is most likely. However, the deliberation with my colleagues has persuaded me to adjust my forecast upwards. Their emphasis on the 'exceptionally volatile' political environment and the fact that the key local poll is a specific MRP model (not just a uniform swing) are valid points. I believe I was too heavily anchored on historical precedent and did not give enough weight to the potential for a genuine political realignment driven by the unique unpopularity of the incumbent government. A full-scale collapse of the Conservative vote could, in theory, allow Reform to win a plurality of seats in a way that UKIP never could. Therefore, I am raising my forecast from 15% to 20%. This adjustment reflects a greater acknowledgment of the uncertainty and the non-trivial chance of a major upset, aligning my view with Forecaster 2. The outcome remains unlikely, but I now see it as more plausible.",
