  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Databricks continues operating as a private company without announcing IPO plans",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues using its massive January 2025 funding round ($15.25B) to develop AI products and expand operations. Management maintains their stated position that going public in 2025 would be premature. The company focuses on growth metrics and product development rather than preparing for public markets. No SEC Form S-1 is filed and no announcement appears on their website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent statements and funding, Databricks surprises markets by announcing IPO plans. This could occur if market conditions dramatically improve, major investors pressure for liquidity beyond the employee program, or strategic considerations (such as a major acquisition requiring public stock) emerge. The company files an S-1 or makes a website announcement before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Multiple strong factors point toward NO. First, Databricks just completed a massive $15.25B funding round in January 2025 (only 4 months ago), valuing them at $62B. This removes immediate capital needs that typically drive IPOs. Second, they specifically allocated funds for employee liquidity, addressing a key IPO motivation. Third, the CEO explicitly stated in the referenced article that it would be 'dumb to IPO this year,' showing clear management intent. Fourth, we're already in late May with only 40 days remaining, and there have been no signals of IPO preparation - filing an S-1 or making such an announcement typically follows months of preparation, audits, and regulatory work. Fifth, the recent funding included strategic investor Meta, suggesting long-term private ownership alignment. The status quo strongly favors remaining private through July 1st. Why not lower: Companies occasionally surprise markets, and 40 days is theoretically sufficient for an announcement (though not the full IPO process itself). Unforeseen strategic imperatives or dramatic market shifts could occur. Why not higher: The confluence of recent mega-funding, explicit CEO statements, employee liquidity provision, and complete absence of any signals make an announcement in the next 40 days highly improbable. I would need to see leaked reports of S-1 preparation, changed CEO rhetoric, or credible insider information to move significantly higher.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
