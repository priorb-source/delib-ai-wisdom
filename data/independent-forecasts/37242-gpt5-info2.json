  "information": "Passenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~5 weeks (Promotur/AENA April 2025 report expected early June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (April 2025 arrivals are greater than or equal to April 2024)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Underlying demand remains firm, airlines maintain or slightly increase capacity, and the Easter holiday shift into April 2025 lifts traffic versus April 2024 (which had Easter in late March). Any impact from US policy changes is negligible because US visitors are a small share of Canary arrivals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A notable disruption depresses April traffic: e.g., widespread air-traffic-control or airline strikes, severe calima causing prolonged airport closures, unusual weather, or a sudden demand shock in key source markets (UK, Germany, Spain) leading to cancellations or capacity cuts.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data indicate steady year-over-year growth into 2025: AENA reports Canary traffic up 3.6% in Q1 2025 vs Q1 2024, with February and March each up about 2.2% YoY. Importantly, Easter 2025 fell entirely in April, whereas Easter 2024 occurred in late March. This calendar shift typically boosts April arrivals materially and can depress March; seeing March 2025 still positive YoY despite lacking Easter support suggests robust underlying demand and capacity. The linked article’s concern about US-related policy effects should have limited impact on the total, as US-origin travelers comprise a very small fraction of Canary arrivals relative to the UK, Germany, Spain, and Nordics. Status-quo dynamics therefore favor April 2025 ≥ April 2024, i.e., a No outcome. I’m not lower than this probability because tail risks remain: April can be affected by calima events, strikes, or other disruptions that materially reduce arrivals within a single month. I’m not higher because while the Easter shift is a strong positive, April is a shoulder month subject to variability in airline schedules and late bookings; an adverse shock in one or two major source markets could narrow or erase the YoY gain. I would update downward (toward more No) if mid-May AENA press releases or airline load/capacity indications show strong April growth, or if there’s confirmation of above-trend Easter demand. I would update upward (toward more Yes) if credible reports surface of significant April-day cancellations (ATC or airline strikes), multi-day airport closures from calima, or notable last-minute capacity cuts by key carriers to the Canaries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
