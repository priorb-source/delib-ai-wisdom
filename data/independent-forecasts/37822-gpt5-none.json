    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O’Rourke continues signaling openness but defers a formal announcement while gauging support, fundraising, and the field, aiming for a later 2025 launch closer to the candidate filing period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "O’Rourke decides to preempt the Democratic field and capitalize on recent attention by formally declaring—via press conference, campaign video, or website/social posts—his 2026 Texas U.S. Senate run before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time and norms: For a 2026 Senate race, many credible candidates announce in the second half of 2025 or even early 2026. Texas’s primary filing window typically closes around December before the March primary, so there is no immediate procedural need to announce by July 1. This favors the status quo (No) over the next ~5.5 weeks. \n- Current signals: The cited report indicates O’Rourke is publicly open to running (“if Texans want him to run, yes I will”), which raises the base rate above a pure ‘no-chatter’ environment. However, we lack corroborating signs of an imminent launch (e.g., staff hires, FEC moves specifically for a Senate campaign, scheduled statewide tour framed as a kickoff). \n- Strategic considerations: O’Rourke has high name recognition and fundraising capacity, so he is less pressured to announce early to build profile. He can wait to see whether the Republican incumbent (Cornyn) signals retirement or vulnerability, and how the Democratic field shapes up. \n- Why not higher: With only ~39 days left, absent concrete reporting of an impending announcement, the hazard rate for a formal launch within this narrow window is modest. Typical campaign timing and the lack of imminent triggers keep the probability from being higher. \n- Why not lower: He has publicly entertained the idea, and there can be advantages to an early start (locking in donors, clearing the field, capitalizing on media cycles). A sudden development—credible reports of staffing up, an exploratory-to-candidate pivot, or news about the GOP incumbent—could precipitate a quick announcement. \n- What would move me up: Credible outlets reporting he’s hiring campaign staff for a Senate bid; an exploratory committee converting to a formal candidacy; scheduled statewide events teased as a ‘major announcement’; prominent Texas Democrats signaling alignment with him; Cornyn announcing retirement or significant vulnerability. \n- What would move me down: O’Rourke stating he’ll decide later in 2025; signs he’s focused on activism/other roles through summer; another prominent Democrat launching and O’Rourke expressing support; definitive reporting he won’t run.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information was provided beyond the cited article headline; thus, the forecast leans on general timing patterns, the short window, and the single public signal of openness.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
