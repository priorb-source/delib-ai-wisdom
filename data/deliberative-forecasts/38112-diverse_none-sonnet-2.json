    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that largely align with my original assessment, though Forecaster 2 is notably more bullish at 40%. Let me evaluate the key new arguments:\n\n**Strong points from Forecaster 2:** The Indonesia precedent is important - it shows upgrades from partner to full member are indeed happening. However, this cuts both ways: Indonesia was upgraded in January 2025 BETWEEN summits, which suggests upgrades don't need to happen at the summit itself. This actually may reduce the likelihood for this specific event.\n\n**Strong points from Forecaster 3:** The observation that some 2024 partner countries (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) haven't even confirmed partner participation is significant and weakens the 'pipeline' argument. The emphasis on India's historical caution on expansion is well-taken - with unanimity required, India could be a key blocker. The lack of leaks or diplomatic signals with only 5-6 weeks remaining is a meaningful negative indicator.\n\n**Critical reassessment:** The Indonesia upgrade actually demonstrates a MEASURED pace - only one country upgraded in the 7 months since the October 2024 summit. This suggests deliberate, cautious expansion rather than momentum for multiple announcements at Rio. Brazil as host is likely to avoid controversial decisions, and unanimity among 10 diverse members remains a high bar. The absence of any diplomatic signaling this close to the summit is a strong negative indicator.\n\nForecaster 2's 40% seems optimistic given these constraints. Forecaster 3's 28% is well-reasoned and aligns closely with my original thinking.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find myself most aligned with Forecaster 3's reasoning. The key factors that reinforce my cautious stance:\n\n1. **Measured pace evidence**: Only one upgrade (Indonesia) in 7 months since the last summit indicates deliberate pacing, not aggressive expansion momentum.\n\n2. **Host dynamics**: Brazil's historical caution on rapid expansion as emphasized by both forecasters is significant. Hosts typically shape summit outcomes and avoid divisive decisions.\n\n3. **Unanimity challenge**: With India's known caution and 10 diverse members, achieving consensus is difficult. This wasn't adequately weighted in Forecaster 2's analysis.\n\n4. **Absence of signals**: With 5-6 weeks until the summit, credible diplomatic reporting would normally surface if invitations were imminent. The silence is telling.\n\n5. **Partner framework complications**: Some partner countries haven't even confirmed partnership, which weakens the argument for immediate elevation of partners to full membership.\n\nThe Indonesia precedent, while showing upgrades are possible, actually supports a lower probability for THIS summit specifically, since it demonstrates upgrades can happen anytime and don't require summit announcements.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly downward from 30% to 28%, aligning with Forecaster 3's well-reasoned position. The base rate of consolidation after rapid expansion, combined with the lack of any positive signals, outweighs the theoretical possibility of expansion.",
