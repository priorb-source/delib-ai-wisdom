  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current environment of high political tension and frequent large-scale protests is the status quo. In the four months preceding this forecast, there have been at least four separate protests reported with participant numbers well over 10,000. Continuing this established pattern would lead to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The snap presidential election on June 3, 2025 proceeds smoothly and the result is widely accepted, leading to a significant de-escalation of political tensions. As a result, protest organizers lose their impetus, and any rallies that do occur between now and July 1 fail to gather more than 10,000 participants.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the politically charged run-up to the June 3 election, one or more of the major political factions organizes a large-scale rally that surpasses 10,000 attendees. Alternatively, the election result is contested or celebrated with mass demonstrations in the streets. This event is then recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high frequency and intensity of protest activity in South Korea throughout early 2025, driven by profound political instability. The period from January to May 2025 has already seen multiple protests far exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold, with events in February reaching estimated crowds of 100,000 and 300,000. These demonstrations are a direct result of President Yoon's impeachment and the upcoming snap presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. This election is a major catalyst and focal point for public mobilization, making further large-scale gatherings highly probable in the remaining two-month period. Established groups like the KCTU and Candlelight Action have demonstrated a consistent ability to organize large crowds.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85% primarily due to two factors. First, a decisive and widely accepted election outcome on June 3 could act as a political 'release valve', significantly reducing the appetite for mass protest in the latter half of June. Second, the resolution depends exclusively on the Global Protest Tracker. There is a risk of reporting lags or that the tracker might use conservative crowd estimates that fall just below the 10,000 threshold, as could be the case with the May 1 rally where estimates vary.\n\nConversely, the probability is not lower because the political drivers for protest are immediate and acute. To forecast a lower probability would require assuming a sudden and unprecedented calming of the political situation, which runs contrary to all available evidence. The sheer number of recent qualifying protests establishes a strong baseline trend. A protest rally is already planned by conservative groups for May 18, and it is almost certain there will be major gatherings related to the election itself. I would increase my forecast if major candidates explicitly call for mass rallies, and I would decrease it if major political and civic groups jointly call for a moratorium on protests to ensure a peaceful election.",
