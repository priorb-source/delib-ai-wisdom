  "information": "Joe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 months, assuming the event takes place in mid-2025 as implied.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump has a scheduling conflict or decides against traveling to Canada for the event, citing the significant logistical, security, and diplomatic arrangements required for an international visit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the personal invitation of UFC CEO Dana White, Donald Trump makes a high-profile appearance at the Montreal event, using it as a platform to project influence to his fanbase on an international stage after security and diplomatic logistics are successfully arranged.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant logistical and political barriers presented by the event's location, which I believe outweigh the strong precedent of Donald Trump's attendance at domestic UFC events. While Trump is a frequent and prominent guest at major UFC cards in the United States, largely due to his close relationship with UFC CEO Dana White, the calculus changes significantly for an event in Montreal, Canada. The primary factor driving my low probability is the international setting. A visit by a former U.S. President requires complex security coordination between the U.S. Secret Service and Canadian authorities like the RCMP, presenting a much higher logistical hurdle than a domestic appearance. Furthermore, Trump has had a publicly strained relationship with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The research assistant's report corroborates this, noting that UFC commentator Joe Rogan—an associate of Trump's—is personally boycotting the event in Canada and has discussed his negative views of the Canadian government with Trump. This suggests a shared sentiment that makes a friendly, voluntary appearance unlikely. My forecast is not lower than 15% because Trump's actions can be unpredictable, and he often uses public appearances to make a political statement. His strong ties to Dana White mean a personal invitation is likely, and the possibility of a surprise visit to demonstrate his international appeal cannot be entirely dismissed. For this forecast to increase, I would need to see evidence of advanced security coordination between US and Canadian officials, or public statements from White or Trump's team indicating a planned visit. Conversely, the forecast would decrease if Canadian officials expressed disapproval of a potential visit or if Trump scheduled a conflicting high-profile event in the U.S.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
