    "review": "The other forecasters have provided compelling, data-driven arguments that have shifted my perspective. I found Forecaster 3's quantification of the required change—a 12 percentage-point reduction in the affected population—to be a particularly useful framing. It makes the challenge for the 'No' outcome appear more substantial than I had originally considered. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's point that significant, drought-busting tropical systems are 'relatively infrequent' in June is a crucial correction to my own reasoning. I had overweighted the general 'above-average hurricane season' forecast without considering the lower climatological probability of a major impact in the first month of the season. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the specific NOAA forecast for drought *persistence* through June, even with the rainy season factored in, reinforces the idea that the status quo has significant inertia. Their reasoning is highly convincing and highlights a flaw in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was predicated on the idea that the onset of Florida's rainy season and an active hurricane season presented a significant, near-term chance of reversing the drought conditions. However, after reviewing the other experts' analyses, I believe I underweighted the drought's severe starting point and overweighted the probability of rapid, widespread relief within the 30-day timeframe.\n\nThe arguments that the required 12 percentage-point drop in affected population is a high bar for a single month, and that major tropical impacts are climatologically less likely in June, are very persuasive. Regular, scattered summer thunderstorms are more likely to 'chip away' at the significant rainfall deficits rather than erase them entirely in just four weeks. The existing NOAA forecast for persistence through June further supports this more gradual recovery scenario.\n\nTherefore, I am revising my forecast upwards. The path to a 'No' resolution seems narrower now, relying on a relatively low-probability event (an early, well-placed tropical system) or an unusually effective start to the rainy season. The inertia of the current severe drought is the more dominant factor. I am increasing my probability from 65% to 76%, aligning more closely with the other forecasters whose analyses I found to be more robust regarding the seasonal and climatological context.",
