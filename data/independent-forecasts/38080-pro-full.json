  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "34 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Harvard's certification is currently active due to a temporary restraining order (TRO) granted by a federal judge, which halted the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) revocation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court denies Harvard's request for a preliminary injunction following the May 29 hearing. The temporary restraining order expires, allowing the DHS revocation to go back into effect before July 1, 2025, and subsequent legal appeals by Harvard fail to reinstate it in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the May 29 hearing, the federal court grants Harvard a preliminary injunction. This injunction prevents the DHS from enforcing the SEVP certification revocation while the full lawsuit proceeds, a process that will almost certainly extend beyond a July 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily based on the likely outcome of Harvard's legal challenge against the DHS. The current status quo is 'Yes,' as a federal judge has already granted a temporary restraining order (TRO), indicating an initial view that Harvard's case has merit. The central issue is whether this TRO will be converted into a preliminary injunction at the upcoming hearing on May 29. I believe it is highly likely. To grant an injunction, courts typically weigh four factors: likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the balance of hardships, and the public interest. Harvard appears to have a strong case on all fronts. (1) The administration's action appears to be 'arbitrary and capricious' retaliation in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, rather than a response to documented SEVP violations. (2) The irreparable harm to both Harvard and its 6,800 international students—who face disruption of their studies and potential loss of legal status—is immediate and severe. (3) The balance of hardships weighs heavily in Harvard's favor, as the harm to students and the university from the revocation far outweighs the harm to the government from a temporary delay. (4) The public interest arguably lies in maintaining stability in the higher education system and upholding due process. While courts sometimes show deference to the executive branch on immigration and national security matters, the political context of this dispute makes the administration's justification appear pretextual, which a court is likely to scrutinize closely. My probability is not higher because litigation always carries uncertainty, and a judge could unexpectedly side with the administration's arguments about executive authority. My probability is not lower because the legal standards for a preliminary injunction, especially the question of irreparable harm, seem to be so clearly met by Harvard's situation. I would lower my forecast if the May 29 hearing results in a denial of the preliminary injunction. I would raise it to near certainty if the injunction is granted.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
