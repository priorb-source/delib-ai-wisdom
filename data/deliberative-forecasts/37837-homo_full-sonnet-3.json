    "review": "All three of us converged on 87%, which is notable. Forecaster 3 made an excellent framing point that I want to highlight: we're looking at 28+ consecutive months above the 400 threshold (all of 2023, all of 2024, and Jan-Apr 2025), which makes the pattern even more robust than I initially emphasized. Forecaster 3's observation that 400 is 23% below the 2025 monthly average of 517 is particularly compelling - it means June would need to drop significantly from the established baseline to fall short. Forecaster 2's mention of summer weather increasing outdoor activity and visibility is a valid supporting point I didn't explicitly include. However, none of the forecasters raised fundamentally new data that challenges the core analysis. We all identified the same key evidence: strong historical June performance, consistent 2025 trend, and lack of any signals suggesting a decline. The main risks we all identified are similar: unexpected reporting system issues or unprecedented behavioral shifts. The convergence at 87% suggests we're all reading the evidence similarly - the trend is very strong but we're appropriately cautious about forecasting future human behavior with absolute certainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain confident in my 87% forecast. The convergence is reassuring rather than concerning - it suggests we're independently recognizing the same strong signals in the data. The 28+ month consecutive streak above 400 that Forecaster 3 highlighted is extremely compelling evidence. The threshold being 23% below the current 2025 average provides a significant buffer - June would need to experience an unprecedented 100+ report drop from recent monthly averages to fall short. Every relevant data point supports a Yes outcome: historical June performance (3 of 4 recent years above 400), strengthening trend over time (2023-2024 consistently higher than earlier years), and robust 2025 performance with zero months falling short. The only scenarios for a No outcome involve unexpected disruptions that have no supporting evidence: NUFORC system failures, sudden organizational changes, or dramatic shifts in reporting behavior. I'm not updating higher to 90%+ because forecasting human behavior always contains irreducible uncertainty, and we're making this prediction before June begins. I'm not updating lower because the evidence is overwhelming and consistent. 87% appropriately balances the very strong trend with prudent uncertainty about future outcomes.",
