    "review": "Forecaster 2 reinforces the strong status-quo/short-horizon case and correctly distinguishes content reductions from taking a domain offline. Their point about low technical/financial barriers to keeping a federal site reachable is solid. They cite broader NOAA cuts, but that is not in the provided assistant report; even if true, it mainly affects updates, not basic availability. Their 87% feels conservative given the short window and current uptime.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces a key new piece of evidence: an April 4, 2025 NOAA statement that all NOAA Research sites will remain online with no interruption. If accurate, that directly reduces the policy/intent risk. Climate.gov is associated with NOAA Research (via the Climate Program Office), so this likely applies. I still retain a few percentage points for monitor/timing and technical tail risks (CDN/WAF blocking IsItDownRightNow, transient outage), so I would not go as high as 98%, but this is persuasive and nudges me up.\n",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: Major federal domains rarely go dark abruptly; Climate.gov was confirmed UP on May 7, with only ~41 days to the check.\n- Policy risk: The decommissioning of the Billion-Dollar Disasters database signals content-level changes, not domain removal. The reported NOAA assurance that Research sites remain online further mitigates the risk of an intentional takedown in the near term, and Climate.gov likely falls under NOAA Research.\n- Resolution mechanics: Because resolution hinges on IsItDownRightNow at the moment Metaculus checks, non-zero tail risk remains from transient outages, DNS/TLS hiccups, or a WAF/CDN blocking the monitor’s request. Those are the primary residual risks.\nGiven the added (if second-hand) NOAA commitment, I’m adjusting up modestly from 94% to 96%, keeping a small buffer for monitor-specific and operational tails.\n",
