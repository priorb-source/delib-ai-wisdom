  "information": "Historical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 31 days (from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The border remains closed. The closure is very recent (implemented in May 2025) and the status quo strongly favors continued closure given the security concerns.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns regarding the Mahmuda terror group and arms smuggling persist. Diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria proceed slowly, and both countries maintain a cautious security-first approach. The border crossings remain closed through the June deadline as officials continue assessing the situation and implementing security measures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive diplomatic engagement between Benin and Nigeria yields rapid results. Nigeria implements immediate security enhancements in Kwara state, including joint border patrols with Benin. Both governments reach a security agreement addressing the terror and smuggling concerns, allowing for a coordinated border reopening in mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo of continued closure for several critical reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely compressed - only 31 days remain until the resolution date, and the border was closed just recently in May 2025. Second, the closure reasons are serious security matters (terrorism and arms smuggling) rather than commercial disputes, which historically take much longer to resolve. My research assistant's data indicates that only 20% of security-related border closures in ECOWAS since 2015 reopened within 60 days, and we have even less time than that threshold. The precedent of Nigeria's 16-month border closure with Benin (2019-2020) and similar extended closures demonstrates that security-motivated decisions are rarely reversed quickly. While 20% of closures do reopen within 60 days, suggesting some possibility exists, the extremely short timeframe here (less than half of 60 days) and the recency of the closure make early reopening unlikely. Diplomatic processes typically require weeks to months, especially when addressing complex security coordination. My forecast is not lower (near zero) because economic pressure could accelerate negotiations, and regional dynamics within ECOWAS sometimes produce faster resolutions than historical averages suggest. It's not higher because the combination of serious security concerns, very recent closure, compressed timeline, and strong status quo bias all point toward continued closure through July 1st.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
