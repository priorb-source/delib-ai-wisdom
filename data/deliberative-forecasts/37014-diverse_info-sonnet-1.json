    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument I hadn't adequately considered: candidate coverage. If Reform UK doesn't field candidates in most or all 81 divisions, they simply cannot win arithmetically - this is a hard constraint that trumps polling. This is particularly relevant given Reform's historical tendency to field incomplete slates in local elections and underperform national polling at the local level. Forecaster 3 also makes an excellent point about opposition fragmentation - Labour and Lib Dems have established local operations in different parts of Kent (urban areas for Labour, western Kent for Lib Dems), meaning anti-Conservative votes may flow to these parties rather than Reform in many divisions.\n\nForecaster 2's 45% seems too high. While they correctly note the tension between historical precedent and current polling, treating this as nearly a coin-flip underweights the massive structural barriers: FPTP inefficiency for geographically dispersed support, the need to overcome a 57-seat Conservative majority from 2021, candidate coverage issues, and ground game disadvantages. Local elections consistently show more resilience to national swings than Westminster polls suggest.\n\nThe Electoral Calculus poll cannot be dismissed entirely - it's Kent-specific and we're very close to the election. However, MRP models for local councils have mixed track records and often assume uniform candidate presence that may not materialize. The combination of Curtice's explicit warning about vote efficiency, UKIP's historical peak of just 17 seats, and now the candidate coverage constraint makes a Reform plurality highly unlikely despite the national environment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward. Forecaster 3's candidate coverage argument is the most significant new consideration - this is a binding constraint that I underweighted in my original analysis. Without fielding candidates in most divisions, Reform cannot win regardless of polling strength. Combined with their historical pattern of underperforming national polling in local contests and weak ground game infrastructure, this dramatically limits their ceiling.\n\nThe key factors remain: (1) John Curtice's expert warning about vote efficiency under FPTP, (2) UKIP's historical peak of 17 seats provides an empirical upper bound that Reform would need to more than quadruple, (3) Conservative incumbency across 57 seats creates substantial resilience, (4) established Labour/Lib Dem operations will capture anti-Conservative votes in their respective strongholds, and (5) Reform's likely incomplete candidate slate.\n\nThe Electoral Calculus poll provides some upward pressure, as does the unprecedented national Conservative collapse, but these factors are outweighed by the structural constraints. I'm lowering my forecast from 18% to 16% to better reflect the candidate coverage barrier while still acknowledging the non-zero probability created by current volatility and Kent-specific polling.",
