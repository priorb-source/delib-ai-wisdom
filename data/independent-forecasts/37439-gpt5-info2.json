  "information": "On May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (eligible window runs May 13–June 14, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Preparation for a potential meeting proceeds mainly through aides and envoys; no principal-to-principal call is scheduled in the window. Alternatively, a call occurs but only one side publicly acknowledges it (or neither does), so the criterion of mutual acknowledgment is not met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A push toward a Trump–Putin meeting or a Ukraine-related development prompts a leader-level check-in. The Kremlin and the White House each issue readouts of a phone call held sometime between May 13 and June 14, satisfying the mutual-acknowledgment requirement.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In normal great-power diplomacy, principal-to-principal calls are occasional, not weekly. Even under Trump previously, leader calls with Putin were episodic (often months apart). Given roughly a one-month window and the added constraint that both sides must acknowledge the call, the status-quo/no-call outcome deserves extra weight.\n\nEvidence nudging upward: The Kremlin’s May 5 comment (per the assistant) that a meeting is “certainly necessary” and widely discussed implies active consideration of higher-level engagement. Such meetings are often preceded or framed by a leader call. Also, Trump and Putin reportedly already spoke in February 2025, showing channels are open and that mutual acknowledgment is feasible.\n\nEvidence restraining the probability: Peskov also stressed the need for “adequate preparation” at “various expert levels” and that no specifics or dates existed as of May 5. That points to a process likely led by staff for now, with a leader call not guaranteed in the next five weeks. Politically, both sides may be cautious about optics; even if a call happens, the mutual-acknowledgment requirement can fail if one side opts for ambiguity.\n\nWhy not higher: If a summit were imminent in this precise window, or if either side had publicly signaled an upcoming leader call, I would go above 50%. We lack that. The prep-heavy messaging suggests groundwork first, making a principal call within this short window uncertain.\n\nWhy not lower: There is active talk of a meeting, prior precedent for calls this year, and plenty of potential catalysts (battlefield developments in Ukraine, sanctions/prisoner issues, strategic arms messaging). Trump is also relatively willing to engage directly, which keeps the chance non-trivial.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast: Credible reports that a summit before late June is being scheduled; official statements hinting the leaders will “speak soon”; readouts of intensified staff-level talks framed as paving the way for leader contact; a sudden Ukraine-related crisis where a call would be a natural response.\n\nWhat would lower my forecast: Explicit statements from either side that no leader contact is planned before mid-June; signs the prospective meeting is pushed to later summer with no interim principal call; deterioration in relations that freezes top-level dialogue; or a pattern of only one-sided readouts for sensitive contacts, implying low odds of mutual acknowledgment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
