  "information": "Circle Internet Group, Inc. has filed a public S-1 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'CRCL'. The initial confidential submission was in January 2024, with a public update on April 1, 2025. The lead underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank. This is Circle's second attempt to go public after a failed SPAC merger in 2021, which had valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO valuation is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. As of mid-May 2025, the deal status is 'filed' but not yet 'active', with no road-show date or price range announced.\n\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to multiple reports in May 2025, Circle's IPO plans were paused or delayed due to market volatility, sometimes referred to as the 'Trump effect'. A May 12 article in Expansión specifically listed Circle among several companies putting IPO plans on hold. However, the market for fintech listings is not entirely closed, as exemplified by the IPO of eToro on May 13. The broader cryptocurrency sector saw venture capital funding double to $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, despite a drop in the number of deals. During the same quarter, the total market value of stablecoins increased by 12%. The regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. remains under development.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "48 days (about 7 weeks) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Circle is not yet publicly traded and its S-1 is filed but not active with no roadshow or price range announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Market volatility persists and/or SEC review cycles continue, Circle holds off launching a roadshow, or targets a later summer/fall window; alternatively, Circle pivots exchange or timing, missing a NYSE listing before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle files an S-1/A with a price range in late May or early June, launches a 5–7 trading day roadshow mid-June, books the deal, the SEC declares the registration effective, and shares begin trading on the NYSE in the second half of June.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Circle publicly updated its S-1 on April 1, 2025, aims to list on NYSE as CRCL, but as of mid-May the deal is “filed” (not active), with no price range or roadshow announced. Some May reports say the IPO has been paused amid volatility, though the broader window is not fully shut (e.g., a fintech peer listed mid-May). USDC metrics and crypto funding are resilient, but U.S. stablecoin regulation remains unsettled. Circle’s 2024 results show profitability but heavy reliance on interest income from reserves and large partner payouts to Coinbase.\n- Timing mechanics: From first public S-1 to listing, typical steps include SEC comment resolution, an S-1/A with a range, a 1–2 week marketing period, pricing, and listing. With only ~7 weeks left, Circle would need to flip to “active,” file a range, and launch a roadshow within the next 2–3 weeks to make a late-June debut. That is feasible but leaves little slack for further SEC comments or market wobble.\n- Status quo weight: Currently there is no roadshow or range and reports suggest a pause. If nothing changes, the default is no listing by July 1. I overweight that baseline given short runway and regulatory/market uncertainty.\n- Why not higher: Lack of an active filing, no range, no roadshow, and media signals of delay reduce the chance of compressing the process into June. Any additional SEC comment round or a soft tape could push them past July 1.\n- Why not lower: Circle is a well-known issuer with top-tier underwriters, a large, growing USDC footprint, and a credible pathway if they decide to move quickly. IPO windows can open abruptly; an S-1/A with a range in late May could still enable a late-June NYSE listing.\n- Upward update triggers: (1) S-1/A with price range in the next 1–2 weeks; (2) reports of roadshow launch dates; (3) SEC declaring the registration effective; (4) clear improvement in market conditions or constructive regulatory signals on stablecoins.\n- Downward update triggers: (1) Credible reports that Circle is pushing to H2 or later; (2) additional SEC comment cycles without a range by early June; (3) deterioration in crypto/IPO markets; (4) a decision to list on a venue other than the NYSE (which would resolve this question as No).\nSummary of assistant’s key points affecting the forecast: public S-1 with NYSE target, but deal not active; no range/roadshow; reports of pause; 6–7 week window remains; market window mixed but not closed; company fundamentals solid but interest-rate dependent and regulatory overhang persists.",
