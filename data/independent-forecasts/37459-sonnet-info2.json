  "information": "The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks led a market rebound starting April 8, 2025, but their performance in the first four months of 2025 was negative. The group's value stumbled due to investor concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced on April 2, which caused a combined loss of $2.27 trillion in market value before recovering by May 2. Specific stocks were affected differently; year-to-date, Tesla's stock had declined 31% and Amazon's 15%. Around May 5, 2025, the US stock market saw the end of a 9-day winning streak.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 days. 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end. Q1 2025 ended March 31, 2025, making the filing due by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Berkshire Hathaway does not hold any of Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, or Tesla",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire continues its historical investment pattern, with Warren Buffett and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler maintaining skepticism toward speculative technology investments and avoiding positions in these Magnificent 7 stocks during Q1 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of Berkshire's portfolio managers establishes an initial position in a more mature tech company like Microsoft or Alphabet during Q1 2025, viewing them as undervalued relative to their profitability and competitive moats, or taking advantage of early 2025 market weakness.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Warren Buffett has historically avoided most technology stocks, particularly those he views as outside his circle of competence. The article reference specifically mentions Berkshire doesn't hold Nvidia, indicating recent status as of article publication. While Berkshire does hold Apple and Amazon, these were exceptions rationalized by specific business characteristics Buffett understood.\n\nKey factors lowering the probability: (1) No historical precedent of Berkshire holding these five stocks; (2) Buffett's well-documented skepticism of investments he doesn't understand, particularly AI-related speculation; (3) Q1 2025 ended March 31, before the April 2 tariff announcement that caused major declines, meaning any Q1 purchases would have been at relatively higher prices without the benefit of the subsequent value opportunity; (4) The Magnificent 7 had negative performance in early 2025, which typically wouldn't attract Buffett to initiate new positions.\n\nFactors preventing an even lower probability: (1) Berkshire employs two investment managers (Combs and Weschler) who could independently establish smaller positions; (2) Microsoft and Alphabet are mature, highly profitable businesses that could theoretically fit Buffett's criteria; (3) Berkshire has substantial cash requiring deployment; (4) Some early 2025 market weakness (Tesla down 31% YTD) could have created perceived opportunities.\n\nThe forecast would increase if there were any public statements suggesting interest in these companies or evidence of Q1 buying activity. It would decrease further if Buffett or his team had recently reiterated skepticism about these specific investments. Given the strong historical pattern and lack of any contrary evidence, the probability remains quite low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' stocks led a market rebound starting April 8, 2025, but their performance in the first four months of 2025 was negative.

Around May 5, 2025, the US stock market saw the end of a 9-day winning streak.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
