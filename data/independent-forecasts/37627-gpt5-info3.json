  "information": "European powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (window: after May 12, 2025 through June 14, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no mutually acknowledged call occurs within the window",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomacy proceeds via envoys and group formats; any Trump–Zelenskyy contact is either in-person at a summit or a call that only one side mentions (or neither mentions), failing the “both acknowledge” criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Amid European pressure for a 30‑day ceasefire and U.S. involvement, Trump phones Zelenskyy to push talks or coordinate positions; both the White House/Trump and the Ukrainian presidency issue readouts or public statements acknowledging the call (or they both reference each other on a multilateral leaders’ call).",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe and bar: We have a short, 33‑day window and a relatively high bar: both Trump and Zelenskyy must acknowledge a phone call during this period. That reduces the chance versus a simple “did they talk” criterion.\n- Incentives to talk: The research assistant notes a European demand for a 30‑day ceasefire starting May 12, with sanctions threats, and that Trump publicly urged Zelenskyy to accept talks with Putin without a ceasefire precondition, while Zelenskyy insists on a monitored ceasefire first. This divergence increases the need for direct leader‑level communication. Major diplomatic pushes typically trigger at least one leader call in a month-long span.\n- Relationship factors: Trump–Zelenskyy relations have been fraught historically, but Ukraine has strong incentives to keep direct lines to Washington open, and the U.S. President has strong leverage to press his views. A phone call is a low-cost, high-leverage tool compared to travel or formal summits.\n- Acknowledgment risk: Even if a call happens, the resolution requires both sides to acknowledge it. Ukraine almost always issues readouts; the U.S. side under Trump could be more selective, though Trump himself publicly mentioning the call would satisfy the requirement. This acknowledgment requirement keeps the probability from being very high.\n- Status quo weighting: As of May 13 there is no acknowledged call yet; in most months, many potential leader calls do not occur or are not mutually acknowledged. This anchors the base rate lower. The active ceasefire diplomacy nudges the probability above 50%, but not by a large margin.\n- What would move me up: Reports of scheduled or ongoing direct leader outreach; one side issuing a readout indicating a call “today” with expectation the other side follows; intensifying U.S.-led ceasefire negotiations or a multilateral leaders’ call explicitly listing both and both sides referencing each other.\n- What would move me down: Clear reports of a communication freeze; a confirmed in‑person meeting planned before June 15 (reducing the need for a phone call); statements that communications will be handled solely by envoys; or a pattern of one side refusing to acknowledge calls publicly.\n\nSummary of RA info used: European 30‑day ceasefire demand starting May 12; Trump urging talks without precondition; Zelenskyy insisting on a monitored 30‑day ceasefire before talks. These raise the salience of direct leader contact in the next few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored.

Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
