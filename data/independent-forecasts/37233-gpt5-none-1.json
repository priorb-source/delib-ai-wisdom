    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until 23:59 on May 31, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no formal candidacy declaration by June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara keeps his options open and delays any formal announcement until later in the summer (e.g., around party congress/nomination timelines), or he signals a preference for a successor without issuing a formal declaration before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The RHDP convenes a party congress or leadership meeting in May and nominates him; Ouattara accepts and publicly declares his candidacy at or around that event before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The question is about timing, not whether he will run at all. The bar is a formal declaration before June 1.\n- Status quo/typical timing: In 2020, Ouattara ultimately accepted the RHDP nomination in late August after initially saying he would not run. In Ivorian practice, formal candidacy announcements often cluster closer to the constitutional filing deadlines and party congresses, typically mid-to-late summer for an October election. That baseline makes a May declaration earlier than necessary.\n- Eligibility and incentives: By the Constitutional Council’s 2020 precedent under the 2016 constitution, Ouattara would be eligible to run again (what would be considered a second term under the current constitution). Politically, RHDP might prefer his incumbency advantage given a potentially competitive field (e.g., PDCI under Tidjane Thiam; questions around Laurent Gbagbo’s eligibility). Those incentives raise the chance he will run, but they do not require an early (pre-June) declaration.\n- Age/succession dynamics: At 83, he may weigh succession planning. If he intends to anoint a successor (e.g., VP or PM), he could still delay formalities to maintain leverage. If he intends to run himself, he has historically managed timing tactically and late.\n- Events needed for a May declaration: A scheduled RHDP congress or national council in May with clear signaling that he will be the nominee would materially increase the odds. In the absence of publicized May-timed party milestones, the base case is delay.\n- Why not higher: Only about a month remains and there are no widely reported, fixed May events compelling a declaration. Past precedent favors later announcements.\n- Why not lower: He remains a plausible candidate; if RHDP decides to project stability early or coalesce quickly, a May declaration is feasible, especially if the party wants to preempt rivals’ momentum.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of a May RHDP congress focused on designating the presidential candidate; senior RHDP figures openly calling for him to run with hints he will accept; leaks of prepared campaign infrastructure timed to May.\n- What would move me down: Credible signals he intends to step aside or elevate a successor; legal/constitutional headwinds; lack of any RHDP May gathering; explicit statements pushing any decision to summer.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information provided, so I rely on institutional timelines, 2020 precedent, and general political incentives.\nOverall, the slow-changing status quo (no declaration yet, typical later timing) weighs toward No, with a non-trivial chance of a May party move producing a Yes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
