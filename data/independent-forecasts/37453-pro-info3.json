  "information": "The discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Alberta does not officially announce a date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Premier Danielle Smith's government continues to use the threat of separation and tools like the Alberta Sovereignty Act as leverage in its disputes with the federal government, but stops short of calling a referendum. The political and economic risks of a referendum are deemed too high, and the short timeline to the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe and unexpected conflict erupts between Alberta and the federal government, such as a federal move to disallow key provincial legislation or impose a drastic new energy policy. In response, and to consolidate her political base against a perceived existential threat, Premier Smith makes a surprise announcement, officially scheduling an independence referendum as a last-resort measure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong likelihood of the status quo prevailing. The deadline is less than two months away, an exceptionally short timeframe to initiate such a momentous and divisive process as an independence referendum. Premier Danielle Smith and her United Conservative Party have consistently used sovereigntist rhetoric and legislation like the Sovereignty Act as a tool for leverage against Ottawa, rather than as a direct prelude to separation. Actually calling a referendum is a high-risk, high-stakes gamble that would introduce significant economic uncertainty and which, based on current polling, the 'Yes' side would likely lose, severely damaging the Premier's political capital. The research provided highlights significant internal opposition to a referendum, not only from the official NDP opposition but also from key First Nations, who assert their treaties are with the federal Crown. This adds a substantial legal and political barrier. For a referendum to be announced, there would need to be a dramatic and unforeseen escalation in federal-provincial tensions, which has not occurred. The current political climate is one of simmering tension, not an acute crisis demanding a referendum. My probability is not lower than 2% because politics is inherently unpredictable, and a 'black swan' event or a sudden political miscalculation by the Premier remains a remote possibility. It is not higher because the political, economic, and social barriers to calling a referendum are immense, especially within the given timeline. I would increase my forecast if Premier Smith or key ministers make explicit statements about an imminent referendum announcement, or if a major new federal policy is enacted that is widely seen in Alberta as a direct attack on its core interests. I would decrease it if the Alberta legislative session ends without any referendum-related action or if the Premier explicitly rules out such a move before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
