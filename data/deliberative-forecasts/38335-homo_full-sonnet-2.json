    "review": "Both forecasters reached similar conclusions with nearly identical reasoning. Forecaster 2 and I independently arrived at 18%, while Forecaster 3 assessed 25%. The key difference is Forecaster 3's emphasis on Casey DeSantis being 'a well-known figure with existing political infrastructure' who could mobilize quickly. This is a valid point - as the current governor's spouse with high name recognition, she theoretically has more ability to announce rapidly than a typical candidate. However, I'm not fully convinced this overcomes the complete absence of any signals. We're not just talking about slow preparation - we're talking about ZERO indicators: no leaks, no staff movement, no fundraising activity, only deflecting 'we'll see' responses. If she were planning to announce within 25-26 days to capture the June 30 fundraising deadline, we would typically see some advance signals, even for a well-known figure. Political campaigns don't materialize from complete silence overnight, especially when facing complications like an active House probe. Forecaster 3's point about the infrastructure is reasonable but doesn't fully account for the active negative pressure from the probe and Trump's endorsement of Donalds.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find broad agreement on the key factors but divergence on how to weight them. The core question is: Does the combination of (1) June 30 fundraising deadline proximity, (2) existing name recognition and infrastructure, and (3) remaining within the historical announcement window justify a probability as high as 25%? Or does the complete absence of preparation signals, combined with the House probe and Trump backing Donalds, argue for staying at 18% or lower? I'm persuaded that Forecaster 3's infrastructure argument has merit - a sitting governor's spouse with high favorability could theoretically fast-track an announcement. However, I weight more heavily the total absence of any indicators and the active negative pressures. In forecasting, when the deadline is 26 days away and there are literally zero visible signals of intent, base rates argue for skepticism. The 'we'll see' language doesn't sound like someone planning to announce in weeks. I'll maintain my forecast at 18%, acknowledging the June 30 deadline prevents this from being much lower, but not convinced by the infrastructure argument to move toward 25%.",
