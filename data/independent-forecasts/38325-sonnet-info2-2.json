  "information": "Historical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate of GDP about 3 months after the quarter ends, which would be late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The advance estimate showed Q1 2025 real GDP at -0.3%, indicating a contraction. If revisions follow typical patterns without significantly changing the initial assessment, the third estimate would remain negative.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate shows continued negative growth or minimal upward revision. For example, the GDP figure is revised to -0.2% or -0.1%, or even becomes slightly more negative at -0.4%. The initial economic weakness reflected in the advance estimate is largely confirmed by subsequent data, and revisions are insufficient to push the figure above 0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate is revised upward by more than 0.3 percentage points, turning positive. For example, additional data on consumer spending, business investment, or trade flows shows the economy was stronger than initially estimated, resulting in a third estimate of +0.1% or higher. This would represent a sign change from negative to positive growth.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate of -0.3% is barely negative and falls within the critical range where sign changes are more likely than for deeply negative readings. My research assistant's analysis indicates that when advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0%, approximately 35-40% turn positive by the third estimate. This is notably higher than the general rate of sign changes (under 20%) because readings this close to zero are more susceptible to revision effects.\n\nThe typical absolute revision from advance to third estimate is about 0.5 percentage points, which is larger than the 0.3 pp needed to turn this reading positive. This supports the possibility of a sign change. However, I must weight the status quo heavily: most GDP estimates do not change sign during revisions, even when close to zero.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the majority of negative advance estimates remain negative through revisions; (2) we don't know what the second estimate showed - if it maintained or worsened the negative reading, that would be a bearish signal; (3) the initial -0.3% reading suggests genuine economic weakness that may be confirmed by more complete data.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) at -0.3%, this is one of the closest-to-zero readings where historical data shows meaningfully elevated chances of sign change; (2) the typical revision magnitude makes a flip to positive quite plausible; (3) advance estimates are based on incomplete data and are frequently revised.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence that the second estimate showed upward revision; reports of stronger-than-expected economic data for Q1 being incorporated; or information that initial estimates significantly underestimated key GDP components. To update lower: confirmation that the second estimate remained significantly negative; economic indicators consistently pointing to Q1 weakness; or BEA commentary suggesting downward rather than upward revision risks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
