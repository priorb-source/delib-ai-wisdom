    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses align closely with mine, all landing in the 70-75% range. Forecaster 2 (70%) emphasizes that 1.8 points is within normal monthly variation and stresses the three weeks remaining before the final survey period, suggesting more potential for reversal than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3 (75%) characterizes the decline as reflecting 'substantial structural headwinds rather than temporary volatility' and notes that the Conference Board improvement doesn't override Michigan's persistent weakness. Both make valid points. Forecaster 2's emphasis on volatility and time remaining is noteworthy, but I'm skeptical that sentiment can reverse course quickly given the persistent structural factors - tariff uncertainty shows no signs of resolution, inflation expectations remain elevated, and the trend has been consistently negative across multiple months. Forecaster 3's point about the Conference Board divergence is well-taken - these indices can diverge, and Michigan has been the more persistently pessimistic measure. The clustering of our forecasts around 70-75% suggests we're all interpreting the evidence similarly, with differences mainly in how we weight the countervailing possibilities.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm maintaining my forecast near my original 72%. The key factors remain: (1) Status quo strongly favors Yes - May's 52.2 is already 1.8 points below threshold, (2) Persistent downward trend of nearly 30% since January with no signs of reversal, (3) Severe structural headwinds - tariffs, elevated inflation expectations, weak economic indicators - that show no signs of abating in the next 3 weeks, (4) Countervailing signals exist but are limited - Conference Board improvement and preliminary-to-final revisions show some potential for volatility, but not a clear trend reversal. While Forecaster 2 correctly notes that 1.8 points is within normal variation, this cuts both ways - we could also drop further. The burden of proof is on a significant improvement occurring in the next few weeks, and I see no clear catalyst for that. Forecaster 3's emphasis on structural versus temporary factors resonates slightly more, so I'm adjusting marginally upward to 73%.",
