  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement is made by Uruguay’s government before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uruguay keeps its participation “under consideration” through June, prioritizes the UN Financing for Development conference in Seville (June 30–July 3), and either confirms attendance at BRICS only in early July or decides to send a lower-level representative. Any confirmation on or after July 1 resolves this question as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Presidency or Foreign Ministry issues a mid-to-late June press release or on-the-record statement confirming that President Orsi will participate in person in the July 6–7 BRICS summit in Rio, potentially framing it as a follow-on stop after Seville. A media interview or official itinerary posted before July 1 would also qualify.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Lula publicly invited Uruguay (along with Mexico and Colombia) to BRICS in early March. Reporting as of early June says Uruguay’s participation remains “up in the air.” Orsi has publicly signaled openness to multilateral engagement and free trade and is confirmed for a UN conference in Seville June 30–July 3. Travel from Seville to Rio for July 6–7 is logistically feasible, but this market resolves on an announcement made before July 1, not on actual attendance.\n- Pull toward Yes: Orsi’s Frente Amplio leadership is ideologically closer to Lula and generally more receptive to South-South forums. Attending as a guest carries limited commitment costs while strengthening ties with Brazil and Mercosur. Governments commonly publish leaders’ upcoming travel in the last 1–2 weeks of the prior month, so a late-June confirmation is plausible. If Colombia or Mexico confirm, bandwagon dynamics may nudge Uruguay to announce as well.\n- Pull toward No: After three months, Uruguay still hasn’t confirmed, suggesting internal hesitation about signaling alignment with BRICS (Russia/China optics) relative to EU/US partners. The government may prefer to keep options open until after the UN conference begins, pushing any confirmation into July 1–3 — which would miss this question’s cutoff. It’s also possible Uruguay opts to send the foreign minister instead.\n- Why not higher: Lack of confirmation by early June and ‘undecided’ reporting; the tight before–July 1 cutoff increases the chance that even a real intention to attend isn’t announced in time.\n- Why not lower: Ideological alignment with Lula, low-cost benefits of attending as a guest, and a clean logistical window right after Seville all support a late-June confirmation.\n- What would move me up: Any on-record signal from Uruguay’s presidency or foreign ministry that Orsi ‘plans to’ or ‘will’ attend; inclusion on an official presidential itinerary for early July published in June; Uruguay amplifying Brazilian communications with its own confirmation.\n- What would move me down: Reporting that Uruguay will send a minister instead; continued “undecided” messaging into the last week of June; silence from Montevideo even as Brazil releases attendee lists without a matching Uruguayan confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
