  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "8 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Liberal Party holds a minority government with 160 seats, which is below the 172-seat threshold for this question. Therefore, the status quo outcome is No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservative support surges in the final days of the campaign, particularly in key swing ridings in Ontario. Alternatively, stronger-than-expected performances by the NDP and Bloc Québécois split the centre-left vote, preventing the Liberals from converting their national polling lead into the specific seat gains needed to reach 172.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong national polling for the Liberals and their robust support in the seat-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec translate effectively into seat wins. The party's get-out-the-vote operation capitalizes on voter enthusiasm, as potentially indicated by increased advance turnout, leading to a majority government that surpasses the 172-seat threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the 338Canada statistical model, which projects the Liberals winning 188 to 196 seats. This projection is not just based on national polls but also incorporates electoral history and demographic data, providing a more granular, riding-level forecast. The entire projected range is significantly above the 172-seat threshold. This quantitative signal is corroborated by national polling data showing a consistent Liberal lead of 2-8 points over the Conservatives. The strong Liberal performance in polls in Ontario and Quebec, where the majority of seats are contested, further supports a likely majority outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the inherent uncertainty in elections and the potential for polling error. The Liberals failed to secure a majority in the two preceding elections (2019 and 2021) despite often leading in the polls, suggesting a potential ceiling to their support or an inefficient vote distribution. The status quo is a Liberal minority, and it's prudent to weigh the possibility that underlying fundamentals have not shifted as much as current polling suggests.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the evidence from the 338Canada model is exceptionally strong. Its projected outcome is not a borderline majority but a comfortable one, suggesting a significant buffer against minor polling errors or last-minute fluctuations. To forecast a lower probability would be to dismiss a robust, data-driven model and strong polling in key regions without sufficient counter-evidence. \n\nI would update my forecast upwards if final polls show the Liberal lead widening, and downwards if their lead narrows to within the margin of error or if a major campaign-altering event occurs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
