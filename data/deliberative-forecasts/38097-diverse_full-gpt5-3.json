    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the key point: credible late‑May reporting indicates Laurent Gbagbo remains off the electoral list and under loss of civic rights from his 2018 conviction, which directly satisfies the resolution criteria. Forecaster 2 adds a useful framing that reversal likely requires a pardon/amnesty or equivalent high‑level action—implausible on the short timeline. Forecaster 3 appropriately flags two uncertainties: whether resolvers demand an official body’s confirmation specific to the 2025 race and the (small) possibility of legal reversal; they also note that further disqualifications could occur (which would only bolster a Yes). I didn’t see fundamentally new facts beyond this framing, but the articulation of the limited, specific reversal paths supports nudging probability up. I find F2 a bit too high given residual risks about resolver interpretation and a last‑minute administrative move; F3 is close to my prior but slightly conservative.",
    "rationale": "Multiple credible sources (e.g., Le Point, Abidjan.net) in late May 2025 report Gbagbo remains struck from the electoral roll and under loss of civic rights stemming from his 2018 conviction. That meets the criterion (“removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible”) before July 1. The official candidate‑vetting by the Constitutional Council occurs later, but is not required by the resolution text. The window to July 1 is short; historical context (including Ouattara’s 2022 pardon not restoring full civic rights) suggests quick reinstatement is unlikely. Residual risks: the resolver could demand an explicit official confirmation tied to the 2025 race, or an unexpected rapid restoration of civic rights/listing; both seem low. Additional disqualifications among the other named candidates would only push this further toward Yes but aren’t needed. Given this, I’m updating slightly upward from my prior 90% to reflect the strength and recency of reporting and the narrow reversal paths.",
