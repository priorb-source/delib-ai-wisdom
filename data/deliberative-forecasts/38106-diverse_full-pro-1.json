    "review": "My two fellow forecasters have both arrived at a higher probability than my initial 2%, forecasting 8% and 6% respectively. We are in broad agreement on the primary arguments against a visit: the timeline is extremely short (one month), there are no official plans, the Kremlin has made any summit conditional on the outcome of the June 2 talks, and President Trump's recent rhetoric towards President Putin has been highly negative. Where we differ is in the weight assigned to the countervailing factors. Forecaster 2 argues that 31 days is sufficient time logistically if the political will exists, and both forecasters place significant weight on President Trump's unpredictability and potential for rapid, unconventional diplomatic action. I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly insightful, especially the point that even if a breakthrough occurred, a first meeting would more likely happen at a neutral venue or in Washington rather than Moscow, adding another specific hurdle to this question's resolution criteria. This point strengthens the case for 'No'.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a modest update to my forecast. While I remain more skeptical than them about the logistical feasibility of arranging a presidential visit to Russia on such short notice, their consensus that the probability is higher than my initial 2% prompts me to re-evaluate how much weight I'm putting on sheer unpredictability. Both correctly note that a major diplomatic breakthrough could catalyze an accelerated timeline, and Trump's 'dealmaker' persona makes him a candidate for such a move. The argument from Forecaster 3, that Moscow is an unlikely venue for a first meeting, reinforces my belief that the probability is very low. However, to account for the possibility that I am underestimating the 'shock' potential of a major peace breakthrough and Trump's willingness to override logistical norms, I am increasing my forecast. My updated forecast of 4% is still lower than my peers', reflecting my strong conviction that the combined logistical, security, and political obstacles—particularly the choice of venue being Russia itself—make a visit profoundly unlikely, but it acknowledges the non-zero possibility of a rapid sequence of unlikely events that my peers have highlighted.",
