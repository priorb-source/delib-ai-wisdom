    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular session ends without final passage of any bill expanding proof-of-citizenship requirements (or it already ended without passage), no special session is called, or leadership parks the issue for 2026. Even if a bill exists, it never reaches the Governor before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elections omnibus or a targeted bill like HB 831 passes both chambers and is enrolled and presented to the Governor, who signs it (or lets it become law without signature) before July 1. Alternatively, a quick special session advances and enacts the requirement in time.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Florida’s regular session likely ended around early May. If a proof-of-citizenship bill cleared both chambers before sine die, enactment before July 1 is very likely because Gov. DeSantis would be expected to sign. If it did not pass by adjournment, the remaining path is a special session, which is possible but uncommon on short notice. \n- Politics: Florida is a GOP trifecta with a recent track record of passing election-related legislation. Republican leadership and alignment with national GOP priorities (echoing Trump’s push) increase odds that such a measure could move. \n- Legal/operational headwinds: Documentary proof-of-citizenship intersects with federal constraints (e.g., NVRA, prior litigation in other states). The Senate has historically been more cautious on measures with significant litigation risk, which could slow or block passage in a short window. \n- Mechanics of resolution: The question resolves on enactment before July 1 regardless of effective date or litigation. Thus, if a bill already passed both chambers, the probability is high; if not, it’s low absent a special session. \n- Base-rate blend: Given uncertainty over whether a bill passed before adjournment, I weight two states of the world: (a) it passed and awaits gubernatorial action (high chance of Yes), (b) it didn’t pass (low chance barring special session). Blending these yields a moderate probability. \n- Research assistant input: No additional information available, so I rely on institutional timelines, partisan control, recent legislative behavior, and legal context. \n- Why not higher: Real risk the bill stalled or died in the Senate; special session likelihood is limited; federal preemption concerns may temper legislative appetite. \n- Why not lower: Strong partisan incentives, prior Florida election-law activity, existence of a named bill (HB 831) and potential to tuck provisions into an omnibus raise the chance that something crossed the finish line. \n- Update triggers: \n  • Confirmed passage by both chambers and presentment to the Governor → increase to 85–95%. \n  • Public statements from leadership scheduling or prioritizing the bill, or calling a special session on elections → increase materially (to ~55–70%). \n  • Confirmation that the bill died at sine die with no special session planned → drop to ~5–10%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
