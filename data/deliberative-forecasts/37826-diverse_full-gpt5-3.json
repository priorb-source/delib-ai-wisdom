    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both appropriately weight the de-escalation (May 10 ceasefire, planned end-May pullbacks, and India’s May 21–June 5 diplomatic push) while highlighting the residual risk from pre-authorized retaliation and recent precedent for deep strikes. The main new emphasis from Forecaster 3 is the “hair-trigger” implication of granting Western Commanders full authority, which marginally raises the tail risk of a rapid response. Forecaster 2’s lower bound of 20% feels somewhat high absent concrete indicators (e.g., credible reports of ceasefire breakdown or a mass-casualty attack). Forecaster 3’s 30% seems too elevated given the strong current incentives to avoid undermining the diplomatic campaign and the typical initial durability of fresh ceasefires. Neither adds decisive new evidence beyond our baseline, but the command-authority point does slightly increase the plausibility that even a localized IB retaliation into Pakistan’s Punjab could qualify under the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains tense de-escalation: a fresh ceasefire, mutual pullback signals, and an active diplomatic offensive suggest both capitals want to lock in gains and avoid reopening hostilities—especially in early June. Hitting Pakistan proper (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, KP) is a higher bar than LoC actions in PAK-administered areas. The most credible triggers for a June strike are: (1) a mass-casualty terror attack in India with attribution to Pakistan-based groups, or (2) a significant Pakistani violation across the international border. The Army Chief’s grant of ‘full authority’ to Western Commanders marginally lowers reaction time and could translate a border incident into a rapid retaliatory strike that would meet the criterion (e.g., fire on a Pakistani post in Punjab). Offsetting factors are strong: the diplomatic push through June 5, likely international pressure for restraint, the political costs of undercutting India’s diplomatic narrative, and Pakistan’s incentive to avoid giving India a pretext for further cross-border action. Netting these, I still see No as the clear favorite, but I nudge my estimate up slightly to reflect the “hair-trigger” risk and the possibility that even a limited IB retaliation could satisfy resolution. Key watch items: verified calm and completion of pullbacks (downside for Yes); credible reports of major terror incidents or significant IB/LoC violations with Indian force posture changes (upside for Yes).",
