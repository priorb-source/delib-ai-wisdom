    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with all our probabilities clustering in the 12-18% range. We all correctly identified the same core drivers shaping this forecast: the host nation Brazil's publicly stated preference for consolidation over expansion, the high bar of unanimous consent, recent signs of internal discord (the failed communiqué), and the short timeline until the summit. Forecaster 2 added a valuable emphasis on how the short timeframe (just over a month) makes the complex negotiations required for building unanimity particularly difficult. Forecaster 3 introduced a highly plausible, albeit low-probability, scenario for a 'Yes' outcome: a 'symbolic, single-country invite' emerging as a negotiated deliverable, pushed by pro-expansion members like China and Russia. Both analyses were convincing and helped sharpen the reasoning around the central forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. My initial reasoning remains robust and is reinforced by the consensus view. The primary factor weighing against a new invitation is the explicit and public position of the host country, Brazil, which favors a period of 'stabilization' for the bloc. This position is reflected in the draft agendas and is a significant hurdle, as the host largely controls the summit's focus. The requirement for unanimous consent among all members is a formidable barrier, especially given recent evidence of disunity, such as the failure to agree on a joint communiqué in April. As Forecaster 2 highlighted, the short five-week timeline is insufficient for the intensive diplomatic work needed to overcome these obstacles and forge a consensus on new members.\n\nHowever, the probability is not near-zero. Forecaster 3's point about a potential 'symbolic, single-country invite' as a negotiated compromise is a key consideration. Pro-expansion members, notably China and Russia, have an interest in maintaining the bloc's momentum and may exert significant political pressure for at least one new member. The new 'partner country' framework provides a pool of candidates from which a single, relatively uncontroversial country could be elevated as a political deliverable for the summit. These competing forces—Brazil's push for consolidation versus the pro-expansion bloc's push for momentum—are finely balanced. The arguments presented by the other forecasters have not shifted this balance significantly for me but have clarified the specific mechanisms for both a 'No' and a 'Yes' outcome, solidifying my confidence in my initial 15% estimate.",
