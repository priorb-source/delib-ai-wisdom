    "review": "All three forecasters converge on very similar probabilities (18%, 20%, 22%), which validates the core assessment that the status quo strongly favors No. Forecaster 3 raised an important piece of new information I hadn't considered: the House probe into the Hope Florida foundation in late May/early June 2025. This investigation creates additional political pressure to delay any announcement beyond what I originally analyzed. Launching a gubernatorial campaign while under investigative scrutiny would be strategically disadvantageous and amplify negative publicity. Forecaster 3 also provided useful context about the historical announcement window (8-18 months before the August 2026 primary), which extends through December 2025 - this reinforces that there's no urgency forcing an announcement before July 1. The June 30 fundraising deadline is a valid tactical consideration, but by June 5th we would typically see advance signals if an announcement were planned to coincide with quarter-end. All forecasters correctly identify the lack of campaign infrastructure signals, Trump's endorsement of Donalds as a significant headwind, and the absence of any reporting suggesting imminent announcement. The tight clustering of our independent forecasts (18-22%) suggests we're all capturing the same fundamental reality: absent clear evidence of change, the status quo persists.",
    "rationale": "The Hope Florida foundation probe is genuinely new information that adds another layer of political complication beyond what I initially considered. An active investigation creates strong incentive to postpone a campaign launch to avoid amplifying negative coverage and appearing tone-deaf. This reinforces why we see no announcement signals despite being within the typical historical window for governor announcements. Combined with Trump's endorsement of Donalds, mixed polling data, Ron DeSantis's silence, and complete absence of visible campaign preparation, the convergence of factors pointing toward delay is even stronger than my original analysis suggested. The 26-day window remains theoretically sufficient for an announcement, and the DeSantis name still carries weight in Florida politics, but the investigation adds meaningful additional reason to wait. I'm updating downward modestly from 18% to 16% to reflect this additional complication. The forecast isn't lower because surprises do happen in politics, and 26 days provides enough time for a decision if circumstances suddenly changed. It's not higher because every observable indicator points toward maintaining the status quo of no announcement.",
