    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are strong and align very closely with my own. We all correctly identify the extremely strong status quo bias, the importance of Senator Fetterman's public statement that he will not resign, and his health history as the primary, albeit small, risk factor. They did not raise evidence I hadn't considered, but their consensus at 2% has prompted me to re-evaluate the weight I gave to the non-health-related risks. Their reasoning is convincing; they emphasize that the political incentives to remain in the caucus are powerful enough to contain the kind of frustration and isolation described in the media, especially over a very short one-month timeframe. This makes a purely political break less probable than I might have initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 3% to 2%. My initial forecast assigned a small amount of probability to two distinct pathways for a 'Yes' outcome: a resignation due to health, and a resignation or party switch due to political frustration. The deliberation with my colleagues has convinced me that I overweighted the second pathway. Their analysis rightly underscores the immense institutional and political incentives (committee assignments, party support, voter base) that essentially lock a senator into their caucus, even amidst personal or political friction. These incentives make a purely political departure in the next ~30 days extraordinarily unlikely. The risk is therefore almost entirely concentrated in the low-probability tail event of a sudden, severe health crisis forcing a resignation. A 2% forecast better reflects this narrower, health-centric risk profile, bringing my assessment in line with the other experts.",
