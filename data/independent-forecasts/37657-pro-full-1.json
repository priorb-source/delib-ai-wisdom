  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any credible reports of human infection from the WHO, CDC, or other major global health organizations. Despite its ability to infect human cells in a lab, HKU5-CoV-2 does not successfully make a zoonotic jump or escape from a laboratory setting, and existing global surveillance systems for severe respiratory infections find no evidence of its presence in the human population.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A single case or small cluster of human infections is detected, most likely through enhanced surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). The infection could stem from a zoonotic spillover event involving an individual with close contact with the host bat species, or, less likely, from an accidental laboratory exposure. The case is confirmed via genetic sequencing and reported by a credible public health authority before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is that there are currently no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2. The primary reasons for this low probability forecast are:\n\n1.  **Short Timeframe**: With less than two months until the resolution date, there is a very limited window for a spillover event to occur, be detected, and be officially reported.\n2.  **Lack of Evidence Despite Surveillance**: The report notes that robust post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in multiple countries and have not detected any signals of this virus. This is a strong piece of evidence that it is not currently circulating in humans, even at low levels.\n3.  **Low Biological Efficiency**: While the virus can infect human cells in a lab, its cell-entry efficiency is reportedly 'significantly lower' than that of SARS-CoV-2. This suggests a higher biological barrier for a successful, sustained infection to occur in a human host.\n4.  **Historical Base Rate**: Zoonotic spillover from novel bat coronaviruses is a historically rare event. As the provided research indicates, only two of approximately 50 such viruses described since 2000 have caused confirmed human cases within a similar timeframe.\n\nThe probability is not zero because the virus has demonstrated the biological capability to bind to human ACE2 receptors. This establishes a plausible mechanism for infection, even if it is inefficient. The possibility of a one-off zoonotic event or a rare laboratory accident, while remote, cannot be entirely discounted.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of unexplained SARI clusters in regions inhabited by the virus's bat host, or any preliminary alerts from sources like ProMED. I would decrease my forecast as the deadline approaches with no such signals, although it is already very low.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
