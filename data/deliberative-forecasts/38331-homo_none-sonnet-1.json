    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that align closely with mine. Forecaster 2 makes an important clarification that only ONE country needs to unblock for a No resolution, though this cuts both ways - it increases the number of potential failure points but each individual failure point remains unlikely in 26 days. Forecaster 3 provides valuable historical context with specific dates for when blocks began, reinforcing how long-established these policies are. Both emphasize the short timeframe more strongly than I did initially. All three of us identify Venezuela as the primary risk factor. Key points I now weigh more heavily: (1) The question explicitly accounts for Wikipedia edit wars and consensus issues through admin discretion, reducing this risk factor; (2) 26 days is genuinely an extremely short timeframe for authoritarian regime policy changes; (3) No signals of policy change exist. However, I notice that assigning 92-93% still leaves 7-8% probability for unlikely events, which seems slightly generous given the question's design safeguards.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I believe my initial 87% was somewhat too conservative. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that 26 days is an exceptionally short timeframe for policy changes in authoritarian regimes with decade-long censorship practices. The question's provisions for handling Wikipedia edit wars and consensus issues reduce that risk factor more than I initially weighted. However, I'm not quite as confident as the 92-93% range because: (1) Venezuela's social media policies have shown more volatility than the others; (2) Myanmar's post-2021 coup situation could theoretically shift; (3) Wikipedia editing practices, while addressed in the resolution criteria, can still produce unexpected edge cases; (4) There's inherent uncertainty in any forecast. The historical stability of these blocks (China and Iran since ~2009, Russia since 2022) strongly supports the status quo. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 87-93% range suggests this is the appropriate confidence level. I'm updating upward but stopping short of the others' forecasts to maintain some additional caution around Venezuela and Wikipedia factors.",
