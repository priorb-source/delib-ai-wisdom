    "review": "The deliberation revealed a consensus on the primary barriers to a 'Yes' outcome: the UK Supreme Court ruling and the very short timeframe. All forecasters agree that the resolution criteria, which disregard UK legality, create a potential path for a 'Yes' resolution via a purely political announcement. The key point of disagreement is with Forecaster 2, who places significant weight on a single poll showing a lead for independence, arguing it creates 'immense pressure' for the Scottish National Party (SNP) to act. I find this unconvincing, as major strategic shifts are rarely based on single data points. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with my own and strengthens the case for a low probability by introducing a crucial point I hadn't explicitly considered: the SNP's established alternative strategy of using general elections as 'de facto' referendums. This provides a clear, existing outlet for pro-independence sentiment that is far less risky than unilaterally announcing a non-binding vote.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The other forecasters' analyses have not convinced me to increase my probability; in fact, Forecaster 3's reasoning has reinforced my initial assessment. The core argument for a low probability remains the powerful combination of legal and political barriers, the established status quo, and the extremely short timeframe. Forecaster 2's argument that a single poll could force the SNP's hand is a valid consideration of political pressure, but I believe it is overstated. The political risks of announcing a legally-dubious referendum that opponents would boycott are immense, and would likely be seen as a strategic blunder unless preceded by a sustained, overwhelming, and multi-source shift in public opinion. The point raised by Forecaster 3 about the SNP's alternative 'de facto referendum' strategy is key; they already have a declared strategic path to pursue independence that does not involve the high-risk, low-reward tactic of announcing an unsanctioned vote on a short timeline. Without any preparatory signals and with a clear alternative strategy in place, a surprise announcement before July 1 remains a remote possibility rather than a likely response to a single poll.",
