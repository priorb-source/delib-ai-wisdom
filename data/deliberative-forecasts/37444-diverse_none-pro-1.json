    "review": "The other two forecasters and I agree on the fundamental dynamics: a strong status quo favoring 'No' due to political realities and the non-operational state of the pipeline, with the primary signal for a 'Yes' outcome being the Politico report of a White House debate. Forecaster 2's analysis is very similar to my own but assigns a slightly higher probability. I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly insightful. They introduced a crucial scenario I had not sufficiently considered: that a delisting would not happen in isolation but as part of a broader diplomatic package, such as a prisoner exchange. This framing provides a much more politically plausible pathway for the administration to lift these specific sanctions, as it could be presented as a necessary concession for a greater strategic win. This argument is very convincing and highlights a weakness in my initial reasoning, which viewed the policy change as a standalone event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. My initial 10% probability was based on the extremely low likelihood of a unilateral, standalone decision to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, given the immense political costs and short timeline. Forecaster 3's argument that such an action would most plausibly occur as part of a larger diplomatic package is compelling. While a prisoner swap or other major agreement with Russia is itself a low-probability event within the next 56 days, it is not impossible, and if it were to happen, including the Nord Stream 2 delisting as a concession is a realistic scenario. This provides a more viable, albeit still unlikely, path to a 'Yes' resolution. Both other forecasters also correctly noted that if a political decision is made, administrative implementation by OFAC can happen very quickly, so the short timeframe is a political, not a logistical, barrier. Weighing the powerful status quo against this more plausible 'package deal' scenario, I believe my initial forecast was too low. I am increasing my probability from 10% to 17%, to better reflect the possibility of a major diplomatic development forcing this specific policy change.",
