    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus, arriving at an identical forecast of 1%. This agreement stems from a shared understanding of the core facts and the resolution criteria. We all correctly identified that Johnny Walker's officially reported withdrawal due to injury and the subsequent booking of a replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, are the decisive factors. The analyses by the other forecasters are convincing as they rely on the same credible media sources (MMA Fighting, RotoWire) and correctly apply the explicit resolution criteria, which mandate a 'No' resolution if the specific fight between Walker and Murzakanov does not happen at UFC 316. No new evidence or arguments were presented that I had not already considered; rather, their analyses serve to reinforce the confidence in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. My initial reasoning remains unchanged and has been strongly validated by the analyses of the other two forecasters. The situation is unambiguous: Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the fight, and a replacement has been officially announced. The resolution criteria are explicit: 'If Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.' The current, confirmed state of affairs directly fulfills this condition for a 'No' outcome. With the event less than two weeks away, the probability of the original fight being reinstated is infinitesimally small. It would require an unprecedented series of events: the new opponent withdrawing, Walker making a miraculous and instantaneous recovery, passing all medical checks, and the UFC re-booking the fight at the last minute. This scenario is highly improbable. My 1% forecast acknowledges this remote theoretical possibility while reflecting the overwhelming likelihood of a 'No' resolution based on the established facts. There is no new information to warrant a change in my forecast.",
