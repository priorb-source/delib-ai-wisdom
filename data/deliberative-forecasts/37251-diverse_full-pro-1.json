    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that have caused me to significantly revise my initial, overly optimistic forecast. Both forecasters correctly identified the missed Q1 2025 deadline as a much more significant negative indicator than I had initially assessed. A four-month delay after reports of being in the 'final stages' suggests genuine, non-trivial obstacles. \n\nForecaster 2's point about this being South Korea's *first* major arms sale to Vietnam, and thus subject to heightened scrutiny and potential complications, is a crucial piece of context I had understated. \n\nForecaster 3's analysis was particularly persuasive, introducing two critical risks I had overlooked. First, the possibility that Vietnam, given its political sensitivity and desire to avoid antagonizing China, might insist on a confidential agreement. A signed deal without a public government announcement would resolve this question as 'No.' Second, the point about the inherent slowness of Vietnamese procurement and the complexity of the total package (training, logistics, etc.) provides a strong rationale for why 'final stages' could still stretch for many months. \n\nTheir reasoning is highly convincing, and my initial forecast did not adequately weigh the negative signal of the delay or the unique political and bureaucratic risks associated with this specific bilateral deal.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially lowering my forecast from 85% to 55%, a 30-point decrease. The primary reason for this significant revision is the compelling evidence and reasoning presented by the other forecasters, which I had previously undervalued.\n\nMy initial analysis overweighted the strategic momentum and preparatory steps (like troop training), while underestimating the negative signal sent by the missed Q1 2025 deadline. A delay of this length is a material event, suggesting that the final hurdles are more significant than I had assumed.\n\nFurthermore, Forecaster 3's point about a potential lack of a public announcement is critical. Vietnam's cautious foreign policy, especially concerning China, creates a real possibility that even if a deal is signed, it may not be officially announced by either government before the deadline, which would cause the question to resolve to 'No'. Vietnam's bureaucracy is also known to be slow-moving, adding another layer of potential delay.\n\nDespite these new considerations, I am maintaining a forecast slightly above 50%. The fundamental strategic drivers for both nations remain exceptionally strong. Vietnam's need to diversify its military hardware is urgent, and for South Korea, this is a landmark deal. The fact that Vietnamese troops have already trained on the K9 system indicates a very high level of commitment, past the point of simple exploration. While Vietnam might prefer discretion, South Korea and Hanwha Aerospace have strong incentives to publicize such a major export win. I believe this pressure for an announcement, combined with the powerful underlying momentum, still makes a 'Yes' outcome slightly more likely than not within the remaining two months. However, the risks of delay and non-announcement are now clearly much higher in my assessment.",
