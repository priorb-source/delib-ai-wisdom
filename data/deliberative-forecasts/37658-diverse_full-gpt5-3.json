    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize the political headwinds and the June 18 catalyst. However, they implicitly assume that an adverse outcome on/after June 18 would force an immediate termination and 8‑K before July 1. That’s not guaranteed. Parties often preserve optionality via appeals or mitigation talks rather than formally terminating, especially if the merger agreement’s risk allocation and any reverse fee make premature termination costly. They also underweight the resolution criterion: the question resolves only on an 8‑K filed before July 1. Even if the deal is effectively blocked, the companies can delay formal termination (and thus the 8‑K) past July 1. Additionally, it’s likely only U.S. Steel would file an 8‑K (Nippon Steel, as a foreign issuer, would typically use a Form 6‑K), which further narrows the trigger path. The market spread mostly reflects long‑run failure, not necessarily near‑term abandonment. I find their probabilities too high for a pre–July 1 filing, though the June 18 window does warrant a modest upward adjustment from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers unchanged: strong bipartisan/presidential opposition elevates ultimate failure risk, but the near‑term resolution hinges on whether the parties choose to terminate and file an 8‑K before July 1. With ~6 weeks left, incentives favor delay: ongoing litigation, potential stays, and the desire to avoid triggering any reverse fee or foreclosing future options. If a prohibition becomes effective June 18 with no stay, a swift termination and prompt 8‑K is possible, but not inevitable—appeals or continued engagement could push any formal termination into July or later. The 4‑business‑day 8‑K requirement doesn’t force filing before July 1 if termination occurs very late in June, and companies often file promptly only when they want to signal finality. Given these dynamics, I modestly raise my forecast to reflect the real (but not dominant) chance that a hard June 18 outcome prompts an immediate termination and 8‑K before July 1. Absent clear signals of imminent termination or an order that requires immediate abandonment with no stay, delay remains the base case.",
