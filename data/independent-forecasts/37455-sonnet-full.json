  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Lesotho does not currently appear as 'Available' on Starlink's availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink experiences technical or logistical delays in launching service, prioritizes other markets, or encounters complications due to South Africa's lack of Starlink licensing. The company takes longer than 78 days from license approval to launch, missing the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows its recent DRC playbook, where service became available within days of license approval. The company rapidly deploys in Lesotho, updating its availability map sometime in the next 55 days. Given Lesotho's small size and mountainous terrain being well-suited to satellite internet, the launch proceeds smoothly.",
    "rationale": "The most significant factor favoring a Yes outcome is the recent DRC precedent. Starlink received a license around May 3-5, 2025, and announced service availability by May 5 with launch expected within days. This demonstrates Starlink's capability for extremely rapid deployment when motivated. However, Lesotho's license was granted on April 14, 2025 - 23 days ago - and there's been no announcement yet. This delay suggests either different circumstances or lower priority compared to DRC.\n\nKey factors supporting a Yes outcome: (1) 55 days remaining provides substantial time for deployment; (2) the regulatory hurdle has been cleared; (3) Lesotho's small size (30,355 km²) could facilitate faster rollout; (4) satellite internet is particularly suited to mountainous terrain.\n\nKey factors supporting a No outcome: (1) No movement in 23 days since license, contrasting with DRC's immediate action; (2) Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink lacks a license, potentially creating logistical complications; (3) No official timeline was provided; (4) smaller market may not be a priority.\n\nThe question is essentially whether Starlink will launch within 78 days of license approval. This is a reasonable timeframe even without the DRC precedent. However, the lack of any announcement or indication of progress in the first 23 days is concerning. I'm weighing the strong DRC precedent and ample remaining time against the current lack of progress and potential South Africa-related complications.\n\nFor my forecast to move higher (70%+), I would need to see: announcements of preparations, equipment shipments, or beta testing in Lesotho. For it to move lower (30%–), I would need to see: explicit statements of delays, regulatory complications emerging, or evidence that Starlink is not prioritizing African expansion.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
