    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The relative approval ratings between Sánchez and Erdoğan remain in their current relationship",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan maintains equal or higher approval than Sánchez, potentially due to nationalist messaging, economic improvements in Turkey, or political challenges facing Sánchez's coalition government in Spain",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez achieves higher approval than Erdoğan by July 1, possibly due to successful policy initiatives in Spain, continued economic difficulties in Turkey, or political controversies affecting Erdoğan's standing",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of baseline data. The research assistant provided no information about current approval ratings from January 2025 or more recent data. With only 33 days until resolution, approval ratings typically show relative stability unless major events occur. Historical patterns suggest both leaders have fluctuating but somewhat stable support bases. Erdoğan has maintained relatively strong approval among his core supporters despite Turkey's economic challenges, while Sánchez leads a coalition government facing typical European political headwinds. Without knowing the current standings, I cannot strongly favor either outcome. The forecast is not higher because we lack evidence that Sánchez currently leads or has momentum to overtake Erdoğan. It's not lower because European leaders can maintain competitive approval ratings and Turkish economic challenges may weigh on Erdoğan. To update higher, I would need: evidence Sánchez currently leads, positive political developments in Spain, or negative trends for Erdoğan. To update lower, I would need: evidence Erdoğan currently has a significant lead, political crises in Spain, or improved conditions in Turkey. Given the short timeframe and lack of data, I'm expressing near-maximum uncertainty with a slight lean toward Erdoğan maintaining competitive or superior ratings based on his historical resilience.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
