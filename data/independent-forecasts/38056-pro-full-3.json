  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.\n\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nFollowing Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, with the outcome being known by June 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The scheduled fight between Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 has been cancelled due to Walker's withdrawal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The event proceeds as currently scheduled, with Johnny Walker not fighting at UFC 316 due to his reported injury. Azamat Murzakanov fights the replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, instead. This fulfills the resolution criteria for a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a highly improbable turn of events, the replacement fighter Brendson Ribeiro withdraws from the event. Simultaneously, Johnny Walker's injury is revealed to be minor, he is medically cleared on short notice, and the UFC re-books the original Walker vs. Murzakanov fight for UFC 316. Walker would then have to win this fight.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on definitive reports from multiple credible MMA news outlets, including RotoWire and MMA Fighting, stating that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from his UFC 316 bout against Azamat Murzakanov due to injury. Furthermore, a replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has been officially scheduled to fight Murzakanov at the event. The resolution criteria for this question are explicit: 'If Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.' The current, confirmed situation directly triggers this 'No' condition. The probability is not zero because there is a minuscule, but non-zero, chance of a series of unlikely events occurring: the replacement pulls out, Walker's injury is not serious, and the original fight is re-booked at the last minute. However, this scenario is extremely improbable given the official nature of the announced changes and the short time frame remaining. The probability is not higher because the withdrawal and replacement have been officially reported and the fight card has been updated, making the cancellation of the original bout the established status quo. I would only increase my forecast if there were official announcements from the UFC that the original fight between Walker and Murzakanov was reinstated.",
