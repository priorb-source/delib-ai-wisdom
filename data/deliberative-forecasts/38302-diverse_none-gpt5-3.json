    "review": "Both forecasters lean on persistence from structural weakness, which I also emphasized. I agree with their caution about policy surprises and monthly volatility. However, Forecaster 2’s comment on “a favorable base effect from May 2024” pushing CPI positive appears directionally off: a higher May 2024 base would make it harder, not easier, to turn positive YoY in May 2025; a lower base would help. Neither forecaster added concrete high-frequency signals (pork, veg, airfare/hotel, energy) that would materially shift priors. Still, their emphasis on policy tools and seasonality is valid and argues against very high confidence on continued deflation.",
    "rationale": "Net, I still see the modal outcome as a slightly negative YoY print given weak domestic demand, ongoing property drag, and limited evidence of broad-based price pressure. Risks that could flip the sign to zero or positive include May Day travel/services inflation and base effects if May 2024 was relatively low, plus any incremental policy support passing through. Energy does not appear to have surged enough to dominate, and core tends to run near zero to slightly positive, leaving headline sensitive to food (especially pork) and goods. Given the small margins that can flip the sign and the plausible upside from holiday-related services and base effects, I’m trimming my probability slightly from my prior. The other forecasters reinforce persistence but do not provide new hard data to move me more confidently toward Yes.",
