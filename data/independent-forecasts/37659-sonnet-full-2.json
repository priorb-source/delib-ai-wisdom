  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the tracker will show at least 120 objectives as Done",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Implementation pace slows dramatically due to political opposition, legal challenges, or administrative capacity constraints. Some completed objectives are reclassified or disputed. The tracker methodology changes to make classifications more stringent.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The steady implementation pace continues. With 105 objectives already completed as of April 16 and 44 in progress, even a modest completion rate of objectives currently in progress would push the total above 120 by July 1. The administration continues prioritizing Project 2025 objectives.",
    "rationale": "The data strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of April 16, 2025, 105 objectives were completed with 44 in progress. Only 15 additional objectives need to be completed in the 76 days between April 16 and July 1 - a required rate of just 0.197 objectives per day. The recent observed rate from April 8-16 was 0.625 objectives per day (5 objectives in 8 days), more than 3x what's needed. Even if the pace slows considerably, reaching 120 appears highly probable. The presence of 44 in-progress objectives provides additional confidence - if even one-third of these are completed by July 1, the threshold is met. The historical rate of 2.2 objectives/day mentioned in reports, while possibly outdated, suggests even faster progress was achievable. Risk factors include: potential slowdown as easier objectives are exhausted, legal/political obstacles, tracker methodology changes, or reclassification disputes. However, the gap is small enough that barring major disruptions, the status quo trajectory clearly leads to exceeding 120. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because unforeseen political events, legal challenges, or administrative changes could slow implementation. It's not lower because the mathematical gap is minimal and the trend is consistent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
