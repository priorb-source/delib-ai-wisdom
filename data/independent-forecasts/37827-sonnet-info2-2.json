  "information": "On January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days - 9 days until June begins, 30 days of June 2025, and determination on or after July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No pilot UFO report from Africa in June 2025. While such reports do occur occasionally (as evidenced by the January 2025 Rwanda sighting), they appear to be relatively infrequent events, making it more likely that any given month passes without one.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any commercial or private pilots in African countries observing unusual aerial phenomena, or they observe something but choose not to report it to NUFORC, or NUFORC receives reports but hasn't posted them by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot conducting flights over any of Africa's 54 countries observes an unidentified aerial phenomenon during June 2025, submits a report to NUFORC, and NUFORC processes and posts the report to their database before Metaculus checks on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's information is crucial: there was already a pilot UFO report from Rwanda logged on January 1, 2025, confirming that (1) African pilots do report UFO sightings to NUFORC, and (2) NUFORC actively posts these reports. This establishes that such events are possible and within the normal operation of the reporting system. However, the question requires a report from a specific 30-day window (June 2025), which significantly constrains probability. Key considerations: Africa has 54 countries with varying levels of aviation activity, increasing the geographic scope. However, pilots represent a tiny fraction of potential observers, and those willing to report to NUFORC are even fewer. The January precedent suggests a base rate of perhaps a few such reports per year from Africa. With only one confirmed report in early 2025 and no other historical frequency data provided, I'm estimating roughly 3-6 such reports annually from the continent. This translates to approximately 25-50% chance for any given month. However, the status quo principle suggests weighting toward 'no change' - most months likely pass without such specific reports. My forecast isn't higher because we lack evidence of frequent reporting (only one example provided), and pilot reports are inherently rarer than general public sightings. It's not lower because we have concrete proof this type of report does occur from Africa, NUFORC actively maintains the database, and 30 days across 54 countries provides reasonable opportunity. I would update higher if: evidence emerged of more frequent African pilot reports, increased aviation activity announcements, or patterns suggesting June has higher reporting rates. I would update lower if: NUFORC database updates slowed, or data showed pilot reports from Africa were rarer than one every few months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
