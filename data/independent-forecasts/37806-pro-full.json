  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month and 11 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues to focus on other immigration priorities, such as border security or pursuing legislative changes like the SAFE for America Act. No specific event occurs to elevate the Diversity Visa program to the level of requiring an immediate presidential action, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' appearing in a published action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a triggering event, or as part of a planned series of immigration actions leading up to the next lottery application window, President Trump issues a proclamation or executive order. This action aims to suspend the program or direct federal agencies to review its security implications, and it explicitly mentions the 'Diversity Visa' by name to make the target of the action clear to the public and Congress.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the balance between President Trump's established hostility towards the Diversity Visa program and the practical realities of his administration's priorities and the limited time remaining. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is inertia; despite an aggressive start on immigration policy with over 40 presidential actions since January 2025, none have yet mentioned the 'Diversity Visa' by its exact name. This suggests it may not be a top-tier priority for immediate executive action, with the administration potentially focusing on the more durable, legislative path via the SAFE for America Act. Furthermore, since the program is statutory, a presidential action would likely face legal challenges. The probability is not lower because President Trump has a clear history of opposing the program and a demonstrated willingness to use executive power extensively on immigration. A triggering event, such as a crime committed by a visa recipient, could easily prompt a reactive proclamation. The administration may also issue such an action for symbolic purposes to energize its base and pressure Congress. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge that such an order is being drafted. I would decrease it if the administration publicly commits to a purely legislative strategy for this issue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
