    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical factual issue that fundamentally changes my analysis: they identify the current seat distribution as Conservatives 44, Liberal Democrats 13 - a 31-seat Conservative lead. My initial analysis incorrectly assumed the Liberal Democrats currently controlled the most seats as the 'status quo.' This is a major error. If Conservatives hold 44 seats and Lib Dems only 13, then Lib Dems would need to gain approximately 32 net seats to win a plurality - an extraordinarily difficult swing that makes Forecaster 2's skepticism more justified. However, Forecaster 2 may be too pessimistic by dismissing the confluence of evidence Forecaster 3 identifies: the £100,000 Lib Dem fundraising, near-complete candidate slate, Conservative leader Linda Taylor retiring alongside multiple councillors (a strong signal of electoral pessimism), and MRP polling being mentioned in election coverage. Forecaster 3's 72% seems too high given the massive deficit, but their evidence of Conservative organizational collapse and Lib Dem strength is compelling. The key question is whether national Conservative weakness (22% approval) combined with local Conservative disarray can produce a swing large enough to overcome a 31-seat deficit. Wave elections can produce dramatic results, and the 2024 general election success suggests Cornwall remains competitive Lib Dem territory.",
    "rationale": "I must significantly revise downward due to my critical factual error about current seat distribution. Starting from 44 Conservative seats vs 13 Lib Dem seats fundamentally changes the calculus - this requires a net gain of approximately 32 seats for Lib Dems, not defending a plurality. This is an exceptionally large swing for a single election. However, I'm not going as low as 3% because the evidence of Conservative collapse is compelling: their council leader retiring, multiple high-profile departures, 22% national approval rating. Combined with Lib Dem organizational strength (£100,000 fundraising, nearly complete candidate slate) and proven recent success in Cornwall (2024 general election victories), conditions exist for a dramatic swing. The Reform UK vote split at 25% national polling further helps Lib Dems. Cornwall's historical Lib Dem strength at local level matters. I'm settling on approximately 28% - acknowledging the massive deficit (down from 68%) while recognizing that local Conservative organizational collapse plus national Conservative weakness could produce an exceptional result (up from 3%).",
