    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. My forecast of 2% aligns perfectly with Forecaster 3's. I find their reasoning highly compelling, particularly the introduction of the 'Naming/reporting hurdle.' This is a crucial point I had not explicitly detailed: for the question to resolve Yes, a case must not only be detected but also sequenced, confirmed, and officially designated as 'HKU5-CoV-2' by a credible body like the WHO within a very short timeframe. This bureaucratic and scientific process adds a significant barrier. Forecaster 2's 9% forecast seems too high. Their reasoning relies on the meta-argument that 'the existence of the question implies concern' and the precedent of COVID-19. While worth considering, the meta-argument is speculative, and the COVID-19 event is a high-impact, low-probability precedent that may be unduly influencing the assessment of this specific, short-term question. I believe Forecaster 2 is underweighting the powerful constraints of the 6-week deadline and the multi-step reporting process.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. My initial reasoning, based on the low base rate of zoonotic spillover for newly discovered animal coronaviruses and the extremely short time horizon of less than seven weeks, remains firm. The analysis from Forecaster 3 reinforced my conviction by adding the excellent point about the 'naming/reporting hurdle.' The resolution requires not just a human case, but one officially reported as HKU5-CoV-2 by an organization like the WHO or CDC. This process of detection, sequencing, confirmation, and official designation is time-consuming and unlikely to be completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline, even if a spillover event were to occur immediately. This additional logistical barrier strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. The arguments for a higher probability from Forecaster 2 are not persuasive enough to cause an update, as they seem to rely on speculative meta-reasoning rather than the concrete constraints of the resolution criteria. The 2% forecast continues to represent the small, non-zero tail risk of a rapid spillover, detection, and reporting event, such as a lab-acquired infection or an infection in a researcher studying the virus.",
