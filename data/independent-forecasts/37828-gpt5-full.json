  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.\n\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling continues executing privately post-Series G, provides employee liquidity via the announced tender and future secondary programs, and remains focused on growth and legal matters. No S-1 is publicly filed and no IPO-plans post appears on Rippling’s news/blog before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent statements, Rippling either publicly files an S-1 in the next ~6 weeks or posts on its news/blog that it is planning an IPO (e.g., announcing a confidential draft submission or intent to list), satisfying the resolution sources.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: Only ~40 days remain. IPO filings and announcements are usually planned well in advance; a late-quarter pivot is possible but uncommon.\n- Company signals: In May 2025, right after raising $450M (Series G, $16.8B valuation) and launching a $200M tender, CEO Parker Conrad said there are “no specific plans to go public,” an IPO is “not imminent,” and profitability is a precondition. He also pointed to annual secondary programs for liquidity. These all reduce near-term IPO pressure and suggest the status quo is to stay private for now.\n- Market context: The IPO market is thawing but selective. While peers (e.g., Chime, Klarna) are moving, Rippling’s fresh capital and stated profitability bar make a near-term announcement less likely within this short window.\n- Resolution constraints: This question resolves Yes only if (1) a public S-1 is filed or (2) Rippling’s own news/blog announces IPO plans. Confidential submissions without a blog post or third-party press reports alone would not count, further lowering odds.\n- Why not higher: Recent explicit CEO statements against imminent IPO, just-closed large round providing runway, and alternative liquidity path. Short time window. Legal dispute with Deel adds distraction/uncertainty.\n- Why not lower: The IPO window could improve quickly; companies sometimes reverse course. Rippling could choose to announce a confidential submission or intent on its blog to test the waters, or accelerate if profitability is achieved or close. A surprise public S-1 is low probability but not zero.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of underwriter selection; senior finance hires with IPO remit; auditor changes/timing hints; a Rippling blog/news teaser; rapid shift in market conditions; settlement of legal issues; leaks of a near-term S-1 timing. What would move me down: Reinforced public statements pushing IPO further out; expanded secondary liquidity; worsening IPO market; escalation of litigation or operational distractions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
