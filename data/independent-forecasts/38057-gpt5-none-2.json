    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely 1–2 months (UFC 316 is expected mid-2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "- The bout is canceled or one fighter withdraws; or\n- O’Malley faces a different opponent at UFC 316; or\n- The fight happens and O’Malley wins by KO/TKO or decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The booked fight proceeds, and Dvalishvili executes a high-pressure wrestle-heavy game plan, securing repeated takedowns and control to win a decision (most likely) or force a late TKO/submission due to attrition.",
    "rationale": "Decomposing the forecast: P(“Yes”) = P(the specific fight happens at UFC 316) × P(Dvalishvili wins | the fight happens).\n- Fight occurrence: Given the event title in the prompt suggests this matchup is targeted for UFC 316, I treat it as likely booked, but not guaranteed. Main events still fall through due to injury/illness ~10–20% of the time. I assign ~80–85% that Dvalishvili vs. O’Malley actually takes place at UFC 316 as scheduled.\n- Conditional win probability: Stylistically, Dvalishvili’s relentless chain wrestling, pace, and cardio are a difficult matchup for O’Malley. O’Malley’s path is striking at range and punishing entries; his timing and accuracy can deter shots, but Merab’s volume of attempts and scramble persistence are elite. Prior market sentiment (pre-2025) typically had this near pick’em to slight Merab edge. Without verified, current market lines, I set P(Merab wins | fight happens) around 53–56%.\nMultiplying: ~0.82 × ~0.55 ≈ ~45%.\nWhy not higher: Two broad ways to a “No” are (1) the fight doesn’t happen exactly as specified, and (2) O’Malley wins—both are plausible. O’Malley’s striking danger creates real finishing equity, and his defensive wrestling has improved. Also, any late injury, opponent change, or weigh-in miss resolving to “No” caps the upside.\nWhy not lower: If the fight happens, the matchup fundamentals still slightly favor Dvalishvili’s pace-and-wrestling approach over five rounds. His cardio and control time can bank rounds even if early entries are stuffed.\nWhat would move me up: Formal bout confirmation and smooth fight week (weigh-ins made, no injuries), market movement toward Merab, or credible reports of O’Malley injury/limited camp. What would move me down: Reports of Merab injury/illness, adverse travel/weight-cut issues for him, referee/judging tendencies unfavorable to control time, or sharp market move to O’Malley.\nResearch assistant: No additional information was provided, so I relied on base rates for bout stability and the known stylistic matchup, weighting the status quo slightly toward “No” given the multiple off-ramps to a non-Yes resolution.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Merab Dvalishvili defeat Sean O'Malley at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs. O'Malley 2](https://www.espn.com/mma/fightcenter/_/id/600053672/league/ufc)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Merab Dvalishvili defeats Sean O'Malley at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Dvalishvili does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
