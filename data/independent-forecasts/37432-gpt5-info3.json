  "information": "There is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change: Ohio does not pass identical proof-of-citizenship legislation through both chambers by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SB 153 and related proposals stall in committee or pass only one chamber; leadership prioritizes the biennial budget and other items; legal/political concerns about NVRA preemption cool enthusiasm; no citizenship-verification rider is included in the final budget bill that both chambers approve before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Senate moves SB 153 quickly in May, the House passes an identical version in June, or the requirement is added as a policy rider to the FY26–27 operating budget and both chambers approve the conference report in late June.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With ~8 weeks left, the default is inertia. Most bills do not become law quickly, and Ohio is in a budget year, which compresses the calendar for standalone policy bills but also creates a viable vehicle (the budget) for policy riders passed in late June. The question resolves upon both chambers passing identical language (per the prompt), not upon gubernatorial signature, lowering the bar somewhat.\n- Partisan control cuts toward passage: Ohio has Republican majorities in both chambers and a Republican governor. GOP legislators nationally are advancing proof-of-citizenship measures; Ohio has an active bill (SB 153, 136th GA). This increases odds that leadership can and will move something, especially if framed as an election-integrity measure ahead of 2026.\n- Countervailing factors: Proof-of-citizenship requirements intersect with federal law (NVRA) and have faced litigation in other states (e.g., Kansas, Arizona). Even though court outcomes don’t matter for resolution, legal uncertainty can slow or fracture support. The House GOP has had internal divisions in recent sessions, which could complicate quick alignment on identical language. Budget negotiations can crowd out policy unless leadership is committed to including it as a rider.\n- Practical path to Yes: Two realistic routes exist: (1) fast-tracking SB 153 (Senate in May, House in June) or (2) inserting a citizenship-verification provision into the operating budget that must be agreed to by both chambers by June 30. The second path is plausible and time-aligned.\n- Research assistant inputs that matter: They highlight a broader trend (House-passed federal SAVE Act; Wyoming’s law taking effect July 1, 2025; similar moves in Tennessee; salience from Iowa’s audit). This suggests political momentum and messaging support for Ohio Republicans to act. However, they also note failed efforts in places like Michigan, underscoring that enactment is not automatic.\n- Why not higher: Short runway, competing budget priorities, and legal risk dampen the chance of swift, identical passage in both chambers. There’s no confirmed evidence here of the bill already clearing key committees or being formally slated as a budget rider.\n- Why not lower: GOP trifecta, an existing introduced bill, and the convenient, time-certain budget vehicle make enactment before July 1 feasible if prioritized.\n- What would move me up: Public signals from Senate/House leadership or the Secretary of State prioritizing passage before July 1; SB 153 clearing committee(s); scheduled floor votes; explicit inclusion of citizenship verification in either chamber’s budget version or in a released conference report draft.\n- What would move me down: Reports of legal/administrative pushback from key Republicans (e.g., leadership, Secretary of State) or county election officials; the budget process advancing without any reported rider; SB 153 languishing without hearings or votes by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
