  "information": "Key offensive players for the Dodgers include Shohei Ohtani, who is batting .316 with 16 home runs, and Mookie Betts, who is batting .264. The pitching staff has been managing several injuries. Pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell have been recovering from injuries, with Snell having been placed on the 60-day Injured List. The return of Clayton Kershaw is anticipated to bolster the rotation. Pitcher Tony Gonsolin, who holds a 2-0 record with a 2.81 ERA, recently had a start affected by a fingernail issue.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days (from May 19, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Dodgers likely maintain a strong position in MLB standings given the article title 'the wins keep coming' suggests current strong performance",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers experience a significant losing streak or slump due to their pitching injuries catching up with them (Glasnow, Snell out), while competing teams like the Yankees, Phillies, or Braves sustain better winning percentages through mid-June",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers maintain their current strong performance with Ohtani (.316, 16 HRs) and Betts continuing to produce offensively, they successfully manage their pitching rotation despite injuries with Kershaw's anticipated return, and other top-performing teams experience their own setbacks or regression to the mean",
    "rationale": "The article suggests the Dodgers are currently performing very well despite managing multiple injuries, which indicates they're likely already in a strong position in the standings. Key factors supporting a Yes outcome: (1) Elite offensive production from Ohtani and solid contributions from Betts, (2) Only 27 days remain, which is a relatively short timeframe where status quo typically persists, (3) The Dodgers have strong organizational depth and have been 'managing' effectively, (4) Anticipated return of Kershaw could strengthen the rotation. Factors against: (1) Significant pitching injuries with Snell on 60-day IL and Glasnow recovering, (2) The question requires THE HIGHEST winning percentage, not just top-tier performance - this is a high bar requiring they outperform all other teams, (3) Without knowing their exact current standing, there's uncertainty about whether they're currently #1 or slightly behind, (4) Other historically strong teams (Yankees, Phillies, Braves) are also competing and could overtake them. I'm weighing the status quo heavily given the short timeframe and positive indicators in the article. My forecast is not higher because we lack confirmation they're currently #1, and pitching depth remains a concern. It's not lower because the evidence suggests strong current performance, elite talent, and the time window favors limited change from current standings. I would update higher if I knew they were currently #1 with a comfortable lead, or lower if they were currently ranked 3rd or below.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nKey offensive players for the Dodgers include Shohei Ohtani, who is batting .316 with 16 home runs, and Mookie Betts, who is batting .264. The pitching staff has been managing several injuries. Pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell have been recovering from injuries, with Snell having been placed on the 60-day Injured List.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
