  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. If no action were taken, the CDC's recommendation would remain 0.7 mg/L, as public health guidelines change infrequently and typically only after lengthy review processes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Under immense political pressure from the HHS Secretary, the CDC acts quickly and either removes the recommendation page or updates it to state that the 0.7 mg/L guidance is rescinded and under review, causing the question to resolve as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the HHS Secretary's announcement, the procedural and scientific review process required to formally change a long-standing public health recommendation cannot be completed by the deadline. Bureaucratic inertia and potential resistance from career staff and scientific bodies delay any change, so the 0.7 mg/L recommendation is still in place on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the recent, high-level political developments which dramatically increase the likelihood of a rapid change, despite the typically slow pace of governmental policy updates. The status quo, in which the recommendation remains unchanged, would normally be the most likely outcome due to significant institutional inertia; the last update to this recommendation took four years. However, the announcement from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that he plans to instruct the CDC to stop recommending fluoridation is a very strong signal of executive intent. This is not a routine scientific review; it is a politically-driven directive from the head of the department that oversees the CDC. This significantly lowers the probability of the status quo holding. Concurrently, the EPA's review, the FDA's phasing out of fluoride supplements, and state-level bans in Florida and Utah create a powerful political momentum that supports a rapid federal policy change. The primary factor preventing a lower probability is the extremely short timeline. It is challenging for a government agency to complete even a preliminary review and enact a policy change in under three months. However, a 'No' resolution does not require a new recommendation to be issued; it only requires the existing one to be formally withdrawn or the page taken down. This is a much lower administrative hurdle and can be accomplished quickly with sufficient political will, which appears to be present. I would increase my forecast if the announced task force review is given a formal timeline that extends past July 2025. I would decrease it if the task force is convened and issues a preliminary finding or if the CDC page is updated with an 'under review' notice before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
