  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Discord has not yet made a formal announcement through either an S-1 filing or their official website news section",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues IPO preparations internally but delays the formal announcement until after July 1, 2025, possibly due to market conditions, ongoing regulatory preparations, internal readiness concerns, or strategic timing considerations. The exploratory discussions with banks continue but don't translate into a public commitment within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord files an SEC Form S-1 or publishes a specific announcement on their website news section within the next 39 days, formally declaring their intention to pursue an IPO. This could be triggered by completed preparations, favorable market conditions, or strategic imperatives to move forward publicly.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports credible March 2025 sources (NYT, Bloomberg, Ars Technica) indicating Discord is planning a 2025 IPO with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan involvement. However, a critical gap exists: it's now late May, approximately 2-3 months after those reports, and no formal announcement has materialized through the specified resolution channels (S-1 filing or website announcement). This delay is significant. The resolution criteria are strict - requiring formal action, not media reports or rumors. Status quo bias strongly favors NO since we're already 2+ months past initial reports without formal action. Factors supporting a higher probability: credible sources, new CEO with IPO experience, major bank involvement, 39 days remaining, and company's maturity (200M+ users). Factors supporting a lower probability: the persistent lack of formal announcement despite time passing, 'exploratory' nature mentioned in some reports, complex IPO preparation timelines typically spanning many months, and potential market/strategic reasons for delay. For me to increase my forecast, I would need: evidence of accelerated preparation, insider reports of imminent announcement, or favorable market signals prompting action. For me to decrease it further, I would need: reports of postponement, market deterioration, or Discord statements suggesting longer timelines. Given the status quo persistence and formal announcement requirement, but acknowledging the credible planning reports and remaining time window, I estimate a 40% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing.

Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
