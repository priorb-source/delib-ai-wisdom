  "information": "Project 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without current data on the tracker, the status quo would be whatever count currently exists, likely increasing gradually over the remaining time. Given we're about 4.5 months into what would be a new administration, some objectives are presumably already marked as Done, but the exact number is unknown.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker shows fewer than 120 objectives as Done on July 1. This could occur if: (1) implementation has been slower than anticipated due to bureaucratic resistance, legal challenges, or Congressional obstacles; (2) the current count is significantly below 120 and insufficient progress is made in 6.5 weeks; (3) the tracker maintainers apply strict criteria for marking objectives as Done, requiring full implementation rather than just initiation; or (4) the administration has prioritized different goals or faced unexpected crises that delayed Project 2025 implementation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker shows 120 or more objectives as Done on July 1. This could occur if: (1) the current count is already approaching 120 and normal progress continues; (2) many executive orders and policy changes have been rapidly implemented in the administration's first months; (3) the tracker maintainers have updated classifications to reflect recent actions; (4) simple or procedural objectives (staff appointments, executive orders, funding cuts) have been completed quickly; or (5) a concentrated push occurs in June to advance multiple objectives simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "The critical uncertainty is the current state of the tracker, which I lack data on. By mid-May 2025, approximately 4-5 months into what would be a new administration, we're past the initial wave of executive actions (first 100 days) but still early enough that many complex objectives would be incomplete. Early administration actions tend to happen rapidly - executive orders on immigration, federal workforce, and agency policies can be implemented within weeks. However, objectives requiring legislation, regulatory changes through notice-and-comment rulemaking, or major structural reforms take months or years. A 922-page document from the Heritage Foundation likely contains hundreds of distinct objectives spanning immediate actions to long-term goals. If the tracker contains 300-400 total objectives, then 120 (30-40%) represents a plausible completion rate for quick-win items after 5 months. If there are fewer total objectives tracked, 120 would represent a higher completion percentage that seems less achievable. The Keep_Track subreddit maintaining this tracker adds uncertainty - community-maintained trackers may lag official implementation, apply subjective criteria, or update inconsistently. With only 6.5 weeks remaining, the status quo heavily influences the outcome. If currently at 100+, reaching 120 is quite likely. If at 60-80, it's less probable given the limited time for dramatic acceleration. My forecast is not higher because: major policy implementation inherently takes time beyond announcements; Congressional obstacles could slow legislative objectives; legal challenges may prevent implementation; and the tracker may apply strict 'Done' criteria. My forecast is not lower because: executive actions can be completed rapidly; early administration momentum typically produces results; and 120 objectives from a comprehensive document represents a moderate, achievable target. I would update higher with evidence that: the current count is already 100+; many objectives are near completion; or June shows acceleration. I would update lower if: the current count is below 70; implementation faces major obstacles; or the tracker applies very strict criteria.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
