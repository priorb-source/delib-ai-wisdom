    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was clearly an outlier and, upon review, overly optimistic. The other two forecasters provided a critical and convincing reality check. Their core arguments—which I had significantly underweight—were rooted in Lebanon's persistent political stalemate and the failure to implement any meaningful reforms since the initial Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) in 2022. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out that the IMF's internal view is likely much more sober than the Lebanese Finance Minister's public statements, characterizing progress as 'slow' and citing unresolved, politically explosive issues like bank restructuring. Forecaster 3's analysis of the deeply entrenched status quo and the powerful elite interests blocking reform is also compelling. They correctly argued that a one-month timeline is wholly insufficient to overcome years of legislative paralysis. Their reasoning convinced me that I over-indexed on the positive signifier of 'active talks' and failed to properly weight the massive historical and structural barriers to a final agreement.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically reducing my forecast from 60% to 15%. My initial analysis was flawed by placing too much emphasis on the positive momentum of the current IMF mission in Beirut, interpreting it as a sign that a breakthrough was imminent. The deliberation with my colleagues highlighted that this activity is not necessarily indicative of substantive progress. The key obstacles identified by my colleagues—the deep-seated political opposition to fundamental reforms from vested interests and the extremely tight one-month deadline to pass complex legislation—are far more significant drivers of the outcome.\n\nThe historical precedent of the 2022 Staff-Level Agreement, which went nowhere due to a failure to implement 'prior actions,' is the most powerful piece of evidence suggesting continued stalemate. Getting the necessary laws on bank restructuring and capital controls passed through Lebanon's parliament in under 30 days is a monumental challenge that is very likely to fail.\n\nWhile I have moved much closer to my colleagues' pessimistic view, I am maintaining a slightly higher forecast of 15% (compared to their 5-10%). My reasoning for not going lower is based on Forecaster 3's point about new external pressures. The explicit conditioning of a 500 million euro EU aid package on reaching an IMF deal provides a new, tangible, and immediate incentive that did not exist previously. While political inertia is immense, the combination of extreme economic desperation and a specific, large financial reward for signing an agreement could be just enough to force a last-minute political bargain to get a new SLA over the line before the deadline. This possibility, while remote, is significant enough to warrant a probability slightly above the floor.",
