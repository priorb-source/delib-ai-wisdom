    "review": "My initial forecast completely missed the most critical component of the question, which both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 correctly identified. I had interpreted the prompt 'Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney' as a hypothetical premise, leading me to forecast only on the relative approval ratings. The other forecasters rightly pointed out that Mark Carney is not the current Prime Minister, and for the question to resolve 'Yes', he would first have to assume the office by July 1, 2025. Their reasoning is overwhelmingly convincing. They correctly identified that the timeframe of ~6.5 weeks is far too short for a standard Canadian leadership transition, especially for a candidate who is not a sitting Member of Parliament. Their analysis of the institutional and political barriers is sound and fundamentally reshapes the problem from a simple comparison to a forecast on a low-probability-of-occurrence event.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 45% was based on the flawed assumption that Mark Carney was already Prime Minister. I have now fully incorporated the crucial insight from the other forecasters: the primary driver of this forecast is the extremely low probability that Mark Carney will become Prime Minister of Canada by July 1, 2025. Given that today is May 15, 2025, a leadership transition of this nature would require an unprecedented political event, such as a sudden resignation of Justin Trudeau and an emergency acclamation of Carney by the Liberal caucus. As both other forecasters noted, such a process would normally take many months. The probability of this necessary precondition being met is very low. Therefore, the overall probability of a 'Yes' resolution must also be very low. I now estimate the probability of Carney becoming PM by the resolution date to be in the low single digits (~4-5%). Even if he were to become PM, he would still need to achieve a higher approval rating than Donald Trump. While a honeymoon period makes that plausible (perhaps a 60% conditional probability), the combined probability is overwhelmingly driven by the unlikelihood of the first event. Therefore, I am drastically revising my forecast downwards to reflect this accurate framing of the question. My new forecast is P(Yes) = P(Carney becomes PM) * P(Carney's approval > Trump's | Carney becomes PM). This calculation leads to a much lower number.",
