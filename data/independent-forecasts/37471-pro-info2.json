  "information": "Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The official data for May 2025 will be published by FRED in late June 2025, approximately 1.5 months from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The number of new homes for sale continues its upward trend from the 500,000 level seen in February, but a combination of builder price cuts and resilient buyer demand moderates the pace of increase, resulting in the final number landing just below the 550,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Builder incentives, such as price reductions and mortgage rate buydowns, prove highly effective at stimulating demand. New home sales accelerate through April and May, absorbing new construction completions and preventing the total inventory from rising to the 550,000 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The increase in mortgage rates to 6.83% in April significantly cools buyer demand. With a steady pipeline of construction completions continuing to enter the market, the pace of sales is not sufficient to prevent a rapid accumulation of unsold inventory, pushing the total number of homes for sale above 550,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflicting pressures of rising mortgage rates and builders' efforts to manage growing inventory. The starting point is a February 2025 inventory of 500,000 new homes, a level not seen in over 15 years, indicating a market already tilted towards oversupply. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the recent increase in 30-year fixed mortgage rates, rising from 6.65% in March to 6.83% in April. Higher rates constrain affordability and historically lead to a slowdown in sales, which in turn causes inventory to build up. A 50,000 unit increase in three months is aggressive but plausible during a period of rising rates, similar to trends observed in 2022. However, there are significant countervailing forces. The research shows new home sales were still up 6% year-over-year in March, and the median sales price was down 7.5% YoY. This indicates that builders are actively using price cuts and other incentives to move inventory, which moderates the rate of accumulation. My probability is not higher because these builder actions will likely prevent a worst-case inventory glut. My probability is not lower because the impact of rising mortgage rates on demand is a powerful headwind that is difficult for builder incentives to completely overcome. The market is very close to the 550,000 threshold, and the path of least resistance is for the already-high inventory to continue growing. I would increase my probability if mortgage rates climb above 7% or if April sales data shows a sharp decline. I would decrease it if rates were to fall or if sales data remains unexpectedly strong.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
