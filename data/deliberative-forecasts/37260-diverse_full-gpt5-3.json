    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the decisive procedural bottleneck: no application has been filed and the BVerfG process takes far longer than the ~60 days remaining. They also highlight the rarity of party bans, the lack of Bundestag majority, and the political explosiveness of banning a party polling ~25%. These points align with my prior reasoning. Forecaster 3 adds the useful specificity that even supportive expert opinions and BfV classification don’t address the timeline constraint. Neither introduces new evidence that would increase the probability; both mention a black‑swan pathway requiring immediate filing plus unprecedentedly expedited proceedings, which I agree is theoretically possible but extraordinarily unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Nothing material changes my view: (1) There is still no formal application, (2) the Constitutional Court’s party‑ban proceedings are extensive and historically take many months to years, (3) the Bundestag motion lacked majority support, and (4) the AfD’s polling strength raises the political bar further. Even if an application were filed immediately, obtaining a final ban by July 1 would require an unprecedented and very public expedited schedule from the Court. Interim steps (e.g., surveillance, funding restrictions) would not satisfy the resolution criterion, which requires an official announcement of a ban by a competent authority, effectively the BVerfG. I would update up slightly only if: an application is filed now and the Court signals an expedited timetable—still leaving the probability low for this time window. I would update down if key institutions explicitly rule out filing before July, or time simply runs without any filing. Given the alignment of the other forecasters’ reasoning with these constraints and no new contrary evidence, I maintain my estimate.",
