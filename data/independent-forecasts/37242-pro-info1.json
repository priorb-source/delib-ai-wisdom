  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the data is expected to be released in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The number of passenger arrivals will increase or remain the same compared to the previous year, leading to a 'No' outcome, consistent with recent trends and increased airline capacity.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Increased airline capacity from carriers like Jet2.com, Vueling, and others is met with strong demand from core European markets. Favorable economic conditions and the islands' enduring appeal as a holiday destination lead to high load factors, resulting in April 2025 passenger numbers exceeding those of April 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite increased flight capacity, a combination of factors, such as economic weakness in key source markets (e.g., UK, Germany) or negative sentiment from recent anti-tourism protests, leads to lower-than-expected demand. Reduced airline load factors cause total arrivals to dip below April 2024 levels.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans heavily towards a 'No' outcome, primarily based on the strong, leading indicator of increased airline capacity. The research provided shows that multiple major airlines, including Jet2.com, Vueling, and Air Nostrum, have significantly increased their seat offerings to the Canary Islands for the spring 2025 season, with increases ranging from 7% to 10%. Airlines make these decisions based on their own sophisticated demand forecasting and would not add substantial capacity if they anticipated a downturn. This action aligns with the status quo of a resilient and growing tourism market for the islands, as evidenced by year-over-year growth in February 2025.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 25% because there are legitimate downside risks. Recent, well-publicized protests against over-tourism on the islands could deter a segment of potential visitors. Furthermore, persistent economic uncertainty in key source markets like the UK and Germany could soften demand for holidays, meaning the increased capacity might not be filled, leading to lower load factors and potentially a net decrease in passengers compared to a strong April 2024. The mention of potential impacts from US policies is noted but considered a minor factor given the relatively small share of US tourists.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 25% because the concrete, costly actions of multiple airlines to increase capacity is a much stronger piece of evidence than the more speculative risks. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, the negative factors would have to be potent enough to not only absorb all the new capacity but also erode the existing base of arrivals, which seems unlikely given the destination's popularity.\n\nI would increase my probability of a 'Yes' outcome if there were widespread reports of flight cancellations due to low bookings or a sudden, severe economic shock in Europe. I would decrease it if initial tourism reports for the Easter period showed exceptionally high hotel occupancy and passenger numbers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
