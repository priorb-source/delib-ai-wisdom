    "review": "Both analyses closely mirror my priors: the short-campaign remark implies a later start, the base rate for Morgan actually entering is low, and the recent entries (Jolly, Pizzo) reduce any urgency. The additional point I hadn’t explicitly emphasized is the Florida cycle’s qualifying timeline (mid-2026), which further weakens the case for a June 2025 declaration. I also agree with their point that a party launch can proceed without a candidacy and is thus not a strong driver for a June announcement. I find their reasoning sound and slightly more conservative than mine.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~3.5 weeks, with no visible ramp-up signs (e.g., staff hires, scheduled announcement, filings). The default is inaction. \n- Stated strategy: Morgan’s preference for a ~3‑month campaign and “watch the field” posture favor waiting until much later. \n- History/base rate: He has publicly mulled and then passed in prior cycles (2018, 2022), lowering the near-term entry likelihood. \n- Field dynamics: Jolly’s entry on the Democratic side and Pizzo’s independent intent both reduce any perceived vacuum that would force a June move; GOP field remains fluid, also supporting a wait-and-see approach. \n- Party launch: Credible reporting of a new centrist party effort could, in theory, pair with a candidacy announcement, but party formation can proceed without committing to a run. Florida’s qualifying in 2026 removes any June 2025 necessity. \n- Net: The added emphasis on qualifying timelines and the decoupling of party launch from candidacy slightly lowers the near-term odds. A surprise announcement tied to a party rollout or an opportunistic news moment remains possible but not likely absent concrete signals.\nGiven this, I trim my estimate modestly from 13% to 11%.",
