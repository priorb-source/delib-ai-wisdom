  "information": "The US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct phone calls between the two leaders are infrequent, and the current relationship is characterized by an ongoing trade war and public disagreements over the state of communications.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The upcoming trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11 between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng conclude without a major breakthrough, or any resulting agreements are handled at the ministerial level. The status quo of no direct leader-to-leader phone calls continues through June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Geneva talks result in a significant agreement to de-escalate the trade war, requiring a final sign-off and a symbolic public affirmation. To formalize this breakthrough, Trump and Xi hold a phone call between May 12 and June 15, which is subsequently acknowledged by both the US and Chinese governments.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low base rate of direct phone calls between US and Chinese leaders, which are typically reserved for major diplomatic breakthroughs or crises. The status quo of a tense trade war suggests such a call is unlikely. The key variable that could change this is the high-level meeting in Geneva on May 10-11. This meeting provides a plausible, though narrow, path to a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because a positive resolution requires a series of low-probability events: the Geneva talks must not only succeed but produce a breakthrough so significant that it requires immediate leader-level involvement. Furthermore, the resolution criteria stipulate that both sides must acknowledge the call. Given the provided background where China has recently denied talks took place, this represents a significant hurdle.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the scheduled talks between top economic officials indicate that channels of communication are open and there is potential for a significant development. A major trade de-escalation is precisely the type of event that would warrant a direct call between the two presidents.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon credible reports of a major breakthrough in Geneva, especially if those reports mention a potential leaders' call. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the talks are reported as a failure or inconclusive.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
