    "review": "Both forecasters emphasized two useful points I underweighted: (1) the narrow resolution sources (S-1 or Discord’s own news/blog) materially lower odds relative to generic “planning an IPO” headlines, and (2) gun-jumping concerns make a pre–S-1 blog announcement unlikely, so the dominant Yes path is a public S-1 in June. Their seasonality/timing logic (fall IPOs typically going public with S-1 later in summer) also aligns with historical patterns. I didn’t see new factual revelations beyond that, but the framing sharpens the downside for a June signal.",
    "rationale": "We have ~5.5 weeks left. Media reports and bank mandates indicate genuine 2025 intent, keeping a June S-1 plausible. However, given typical cadence for a September/October listing, a late-summer public S-1 feels more likely than a pre–July 1 filing. The resolution’s strict sources plus gun-jumping risk make a company blog announcement before a public filing unlikely. Market conditions are mixed; they don’t force a June move. Net, I trim my odds: a June public S-1 remains possible but not the base case. I move down slightly from 38% to 34%, reflecting a modestly lower likelihood that Discord chooses to publicly file in June or issue a qualifying news post about a confidential filing.",
