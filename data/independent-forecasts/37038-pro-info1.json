  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 1 week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The +17% tariff is already codified and listed as a subheading for Israel in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), although its implementation is suspended. If no administrative action is taken to remove it, it will still be listed on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. and Israeli governments reach an agreement to resolve their underlying trade dispute, leading the U.S. government to formally remove the +17% tariff provision from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tariff provision remains listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule on June 1, 2025. This occurs if no diplomatic resolution is reached, or if a resolution is reached but the administrative action to remove the tariff from the schedule is not completed by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My high confidence in a 'Yes' outcome is primarily driven by the current status quo and bureaucratic inertia. The key information from my research assistant is that the 17% tariff has already been formally codified under HTS heading 9903.01.48 and is currently listed on the official HTS website. The resolution criteria are explicit that being listed as 'suspended' does not affect the outcome. Therefore, for the outcome to be 'Yes', the U.S. government simply has to do nothing. For the outcome to be 'No', it must take the active steps of reaching a diplomatic resolution with Israel and completing the administrative process to amend the HTS, all before June 1. This is a high bar to clear in just over one month. The 90-day suspension of the tariff's implementation until July 9, 2025, actually strengthens the case for 'Yes'. It lowers the political and economic urgency to finalize a deal and remove the tariff listing before our resolution date of June 1, as no duties will be collected until July anyway. My forecast is not higher than 90% because the suspension period was deliberately created to provide a window for negotiation. A rapid diplomatic breakthrough between two close allies is certainly possible, and if achieved, could lead to a swift administrative update. My forecast is not lower because the default path is 'Yes'. Given the short timeframe and the fact that inaction leads to a 'Yes' resolution, the probability is heavily skewed towards the tariff remaining on the books on the specified date. I would lower my forecast significantly upon hearing reports of a finalized agreement between the U.S. and Israel, and raise it upon news of negotiations stalling.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
