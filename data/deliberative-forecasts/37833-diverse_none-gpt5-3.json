    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the exact-phrase constraint and the historical base rate, and notes Trump’s prior preference for “Diversity Visa Lottery Program.” One nuance: if either writes “Diversity Visa Lottery,” that still contains the exact phrase “diversity visa,” which would satisfy the quoted-string search, so Trump’s past wording preference isn’t inherently disqualifying. Their overall low estimate aligns with my view. Forecaster 3 highlights prolific posting and a 40‑day window, but their 18% feels high: Trump’s X posting frequency is currently low (most activity is on Truth Social), and the base rate for this specific phrase remains tiny without a clear catalyst. The “Musk follows someone who mentioned it” point is weak evidence on its own given the size of his follows and the breadth of his feed. I find F2’s reasoning largely convincing, with the caveat about substring matching; F3’s argument overweights tweet volume relative to topic salience and phrasing constraints.",
    "rationale": "About 40 days remain. The status quo is no qualifying posts and no DV-specific news cycle. The event requires an unusually specific phrase to surface. Trump is unlikely to post much on X in this window; Musk posts often about immigration but typically uses broader terms. A Yes becomes materially more likely only if there’s a DV-specific trigger (e.g., notable legislation, court ruling, or a viral incident explicitly about the Diversity Visa). The fact that “Diversity Visa Lottery” would qualify modestly offsets the phrasing concern, but without a catalyst I still expect a No. I’m nudging slightly upward from 4% to reflect two independent chances and Musk’s high volume, but remain low given the niche topic and constraint.",
