  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, with the fight scheduled for June 7-8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight proceeds as scheduled, and the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov defeats Johnny Walker, continuing Walker's losing streak. This resolves the question as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either the fight is cancelled due to a last-minute injury or missed weight, or it proceeds as scheduled where Azamat Murzakanov's pressure and power are too much for Walker. Murzakanov gets inside Walker's reach and secures a knockout victory, handing Walker his third consecutive loss.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker successfully utilizes his massive height and reach advantage to keep Murzakanov at bay with kicks. He lands a sudden, powerful, and unorthodox strike, such as a spinning backfist or a flying knee, knocking out the undefeated Murzakanov and causing a significant upset.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of both the probability of the fight occurring and the likely outcome if it does. The status quo heavily favors a 'No' outcome. Azamat Murzakanov is an undefeated (14-0) power puncher, while Johnny Walker is on a two-fight losing streak and has a history of being vulnerable to knockouts (6 of his 9 losses). Momentum is firmly with Murzakanov.\n\nFirst, there is a non-trivial chance the fight is cancelled due to injury or other issues, which would resolve this question as No. I estimate this at approximately 15%.\n\nSecond, if the fight happens, Murzakanov is the rightful favorite. His aggressive, forward-pressure style is a difficult matchup for Walker, who has struggled with durable power punchers. Murzakanov's recent suspension for an anti-doping violation is a variable, but assuming he returns in form, his path to victory by knockout is clear and probable.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 35% because Johnny Walker's physical advantages are enormous. With an 8-inch height and 11-inch reach advantage, he is a uniquely dangerous opponent who can end any fight in an instant with a single strike. His unpredictability makes him a live underdog in any striking exchange. If he can maintain distance and leverage his size, he has a clear path to an upset victory.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% because of Walker's proven defensive liabilities and suspect durability. He has lost his last two fights, and his style inherently involves taking risks that a powerful, undefeated fighter like Murzakanov is well-equipped to capitalize on. The combination of Walker's recent form, questionable chin, and the baseline probability of fight cancellation keeps the forecast modest.\n\nI would increase my forecast if reports emerge of Murzakanov having a difficult training camp or issues with his weight cut. I would decrease my forecast if Walker appears to sustain an injury or if reputable sources suggest his training camp has been subpar.",
