  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (resolves July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. There are currently no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The virus's low cell-entry efficiency prevents it from successfully establishing a productive infection in a human host, or any isolated spillover events go undetected and are not reported by credible health organizations before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An individual in close contact with an infected bat population contracts the virus. The infection is symptomatic, prompting medical evaluation, where advanced diagnostics as part of a respiratory virus surveillance program identify and confirm the case, which is then publicly reported by a major health authority like the WHO or CDC.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored heavily on the status quo and the extremely short timeframe. Zoonotic spillover events that lead to officially reported human cases are fundamentally rare. As of today, there are no known human cases of HKU5-CoV-2. The research indicating the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human cells in a lab is a critical piece of evidence that prevents this forecast from being zero; it establishes a plausible, albeit theoretical, pathway to human infection. However, this is strongly counteracted by the finding that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a high barrier to successful infection. The most decisive factor is the resolution date of July 1, 2025, which is only about six weeks away. For a 'Yes' outcome, a sequence of low-probability events – spillover, symptomatic infection, detection by the healthcare system, specific viral identification, and official reporting – must all occur within this very narrow window. The probability of this entire chain completing in such a short period is extremely low. My forecast isn't lower because the lab studies confirm a non-zero risk. It is not higher because the low pathogenic efficiency and, most critically, the short deadline make a reported case highly improbable. I would raise my forecast upon news of unusual respiratory illness clusters in relevant geographic areas or new lab data showing higher infectivity. Conversely, my confidence in a 'No' outcome will increase as the deadline approaches without incident.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
