    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the existing editorial acknowledgment of 'Gulf of America' as an alternative name in their articles, WorldAtlas.com implements a site-wide content update that includes changing the label on the North America map to 'Gulf of America' or 'Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)' before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Geographical names on established digital atlases are highly stable and resistant to change without a significant external catalyst, such as a ruling by an official naming body. The overwhelmingly common and officially recognized name for this body of water is the Gulf of Mexico. The research assistant's report provided no additional information, so my analysis relies solely on the provided context and linked pages. The status quo outcome has a very high prior probability. However, the probability is not near-zero. The key piece of evidence preventing a lower forecast is that WorldAtlas.com itself gives credence to the alternative name. Its own article on the gulf is titled 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America),' and the text explicitly states the alternative name. This indicates an internal awareness and acceptance of the term, which significantly increases the chance that they might propagate this name to other parts of the site, including maps. A change could occur during a routine content refresh. My forecast is not higher because changing a primary map label is a more significant editorial decision than including a parenthetical in an article title. Such a change in a short time frame remains unlikely without a specific, compelling reason. If new information emerged, such as other WorldAtlas maps adopting the 'Gulf of America' name or an official statement from the site about their naming conventions, I would update my forecast upwards. Conversely, if the site were to remove the parenthetical 'Gulf of America' from their article, I would revise my forecast downwards.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
