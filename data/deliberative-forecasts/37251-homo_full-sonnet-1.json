    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar evidence and reasoning, with Forecasters 2 and 3 reaching different conclusions (62% vs 48%). The key divergence is in how we weight the missed Q1 deadline versus the strong deal fundamentals.\n\nForecaster 2 makes a compelling argument I initially underweighted: if negotiations were genuinely in 'final stages' in January 2025, then having 4 months (February-May) plus 2 more months (June) represents substantial time for bureaucratic completion. The extensive groundwork - particularly actual troop training on the K9 system in November 2024, not just diplomatic visits - suggests serious operational preparation beyond mere political signaling. This indicates the deal had advanced beyond preliminary discussions.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3's emphasis on the status quo principle and lack of post-January updates is also well-founded. If the deal were progressing smoothly after the Q1 slip, we might expect some confirmation or revised timeline. The complete silence is somewhat concerning.\n\nWhat I may have initially undervalued: the strategic importance of this deal for both countries and the concrete operational preparation (troop training) suggests momentum that doesn't simply evaporate. What remains concerning: the specific Q1 timeline from multiple sources was missed, and we're now in May with no updates, leaving minimal buffer time.\n\nThe question becomes: was 'final stages' accurate (supporting 62%) or optimistic (supporting 48%)?",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I should update modestly upward from my initial 48%. Forecaster 2 raises valid points about the time available and the quality of preparation. The November 2024 troop training is particularly significant - you don't send troops for K9 training unless operational acquisition is highly likely. This isn't just diplomatic theater.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving all the way to 62% because:\n1. The Q1 miss from multiple sources suggests the timeline was more optimistic than the sources realized\n2. The complete absence of post-January updates in a typically transparent South Korean defense industry is noteworthy\n3. Two months is tight for announcing, finalizing, and confirming a $300 million deal\n4. Defense deals face political sensitivities that can cause last-minute complications\n\nThe troop training and advanced negotiations push me higher than 48%, but the missed timeline and radio silence keep me below 62%. I'm updating to approximately 54% - recognizing the strong fundamentals while maintaining appropriate caution about timing constraints and the concrete negative signal of the missed Q1 deadline. If we see any positive news in May (official visits, industry reports), I would move toward 65-70%. If June arrives without developments, I would drop to 35-40%.",
