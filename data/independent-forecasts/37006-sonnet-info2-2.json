  "information": "Recent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Canadian federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservative Party in Quebec",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party capitalizes on the disruption caused by Liberal gains, improving their vote efficiency in key ridings. They successfully appeal to nationalist-leaning voters disturbed by the Bloc's weakness, or they benefit from strategic voting dynamics where the Liberal surge concentrates anti-Bloc votes. The Conservatives could also benefit from having broader appeal across different regions of Quebec while the Bloc's support becomes too thinly distributed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc Québécois maintains their current 5-17 point polling advantage over the Conservatives through election day. Despite losing support to the Liberals, the Bloc retains enough vote efficiency in their traditional strongholds to secure more seats than the Conservatives. The fact that a Conservative candidate cannot run in Quebec City continues to benefit the Bloc in that region, and their concentrated support delivers more seats per vote percentage.",
    "rationale": "Current polling data shows the Bloc leading Conservatives by 5-17 percentage points (23-27% vs 23%), supporting a Yes outcome. However, several factors create significant uncertainty. First, the dramatic Liberal surge from low levels to 40-42% has already devastated Bloc support (down from 37%), indicating a highly volatile electoral landscape. Second, the absolute polling numbers are remarkably close - both parties hovering around 23-25% makes this effectively a statistical tie when considering margins of error. Third, there's a 6-month time horizon which allows for meaningful shifts. The status quo suggests Bloc advantage, but the closeness of polling and ongoing Liberal disruption means the Conservatives have a reasonable path to overtaking them. The Bloc's historical advantage in vote efficiency (concentrated support in sovereigntist strongholds) works in their favor, as does the Conservative candidate issue in Quebec City mentioned in the background. However, the article's suggestion that Carney's surge could 'wipe the sovereigntist party off the map' indicates real vulnerability. My forecast is not higher because the polling gap is relatively narrow and the situation is clearly fluid with major Liberal gains still unfolding. It's not lower because the Bloc currently maintains a measurable lead and historically performs well in seat conversion. For me to revise upward, I'd need to see the Bloc polling gap widen to 10+ points consistently or evidence of strong vote efficiency advantages. To revise downward, I'd need Conservative polling to match or exceed Bloc numbers, or evidence that the Liberal surge is disproportionately hurting the Bloc in their safest seats.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
