    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base case: VHP retains plurality edge due to incumbency and opposition fragmentation, while IMF-driven austerity and economic pain are the main headwinds. New useful framing from them: (1) the proximity to election day increases status quo stickiness; (2) protest risk as a downside catalyst; (3) emphasis on NDP’s ceiling under Bouterse. However, neither adds concrete new data (polls, alliances, district-level shifts) that would materially change priors. I find their reasoning generally convincing but not decision-changing in the absence of fresh, directional evidence.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged. With ~4 weeks to go, the largest incumbent party (VHP) benefits from fragmentation among NDP/ABOP/others and from the NDP’s brand drag under Bouterse. Suriname’s multi-member districts and malapportionment mean efficient, geographically organized parties can hold a plurality even with modest vote share erosion. Countervailing forces are real: IMF stabilization, inflation, and living-cost stress create an anti-incumbent undertow, and ABOP/others could tactically concentrate seats. Yet without credible polling or evidence of coordinated opposition lists that threaten VHP across multiple key districts, the most likely outcome remains a narrow VHP plurality. Proximity to election day reduces odds of a wholesale alignment shift absent a major shock. I would move up on signs of opposition disunity or late economic relief messaging landing; down on sustained large protests, a credible NDP-led coordination pact, or district-level signals of VHP slippage in Paramaribo/Wanica/Nickerie.",
