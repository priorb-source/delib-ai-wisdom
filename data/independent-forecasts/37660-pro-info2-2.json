  "information": "A separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, with the outcome determined by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Starlink service launch in Sri Lanka is currently on hold pending the resolution of regulatory issues, and its map does not show availability.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government over national security and data interception requirements continue past the July 1, 2025 deadline without a resolution, preventing the service from being listed as 'Available'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sri Lankan government and Starlink reach an expedited agreement on the outstanding national security requirements, clearing the final hurdle for the service launch. Starlink then updates its availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant regulatory hurdle reported in March 2025, which has put the service launch on hold. The key issue involves the Sri Lankan government's demand for data interception capabilities for national security reasons. The report described these talks as being at a 'preliminary stage' less than two months before the resolution date. Such negotiations are typically complex and slow, making the status quo — no availability — the most likely outcome within the short timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower because there is some positive history; Starlink was granted an initial licence, and tariff plans have already been approved by the regulator. This suggests that a high-level political decision to finalize the agreement could, in theory, happen quickly. \n\nMy probability is not higher due to the seriousness of the obstacle. A disagreement over national security and data access is a fundamental issue, not a minor detail, and resolving it in under two months from a 'preliminary stage' is highly optimistic.\n\nI would update my forecast upward upon news of a finalized agreement. Conversely, my forecast would move lower if official statements confirmed a stalemate or as the deadline approaches with no news of progress.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
