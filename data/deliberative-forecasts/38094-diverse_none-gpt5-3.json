    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize extreme base rates over a 33-day window and the strong institutional incentives to maintain caucus alignment. Forecaster 2 adds a useful nuance about Fetterman’s elevated health tail risk and his maverick style slightly lifting hazard above a generic baseline. Forecaster 3’s framing of the base rate for a switch/resignation in any given month as near-zero is a good corrective against over-weighting current-media noise; the McCormick support signal is interesting but not, by itself, indicative of caucus movement. I don’t see new concrete evidence suggesting active steps toward a switch or resignation, and their arguments strengthen the case that I slightly overweighted idiosyncratic risks at 4%.",
    "rationale": "Short horizon (~33 days) and no credible reporting of party-switch talks, independence without caucusing, caucus expulsion, or imminent resignation materially lowers the near-term hazard. Fetterman has publicly said he will not resign, and even sharp intra-party friction typically stops well short of caucus breaks. Costs to leaving the Dem caucus (brand damage in Pennsylvania, loss of committee leverage) outweigh benefits; becoming an independent who does not caucus with Democrats would further reduce influence without clear upside. Tail risks remain (health or unforeseen scandal), and his contrarian posture modestly elevates that tail versus a generic senator, but in the absence of concrete signals, the base rate dominates. Triggers that would move me up: credible reporting of outreach to GOP leadership, public trial balloons about independence without caucusing with Democrats, moves by Dem leadership to sanction/strip roles, or sudden health/ethics developments. Triggers down: reaffirmations of caucusing status, routine participation with Dems, or the story fading without new escalations. Given the deliberation, I’m trimming from 4% to 3% to reflect the extremely low month-scale base rate and lack of preparatory signals.",
