    "review": "Both forecasters raise valuable points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 highlights Jones's 2021 statewide campaign for this same office—a critical advantage I didn't fully consider. Running previously provides name recognition among Democratic primary voters, established infrastructure, and donor networks that are particularly valuable in low-turnout primaries. Forecaster 3 provides concrete fundraising data showing Jones's substantial 2:1 monetary advantage ($1.8M raised/$1.4M cash on hand vs. Taylor's $1M total). At 14 days out, this advantage has likely already been deployed into advertising and ground operations. However, Forecaster 3's 72% seems slightly optimistic given the complete absence of polling data to confirm these structural advantages translate to voter support. Forecaster 2's 62% may underweight the combined effect of endorsements, fundraising, and prior campaign experience. The fundraising figures are particularly compelling evidence I lacked initially.",
    "rationale": "Synthesizing all available information: Jones has (1) high-profile endorsements from former Governors McAuliffe and Northam plus Rep. Bobby Scott, (2) 2021 campaign experience running statewide for this exact office, and (3) a 2:1 fundraising advantage with $1.4M cash on hand versus Taylor's lower total. These represent substantial structural advantages in a two-way primary race with only 14 days remaining. Taylor remains credible with over $1M raised and strong prosecutorial credentials, but in a Democratic primary, Jones's establishment support and campaign infrastructure likely matter more than prosecutorial experience alone. The complete absence of polling data prevents higher confidence—structural advantages don't always translate to voter support, and primary electorates can be unpredictable. However, the combination of three independent indicators (endorsements, prior campaign, fundraising) all pointing toward Jones justifies moving my forecast upward from my initial 67%. I'm updating to 70% to reflect the additional evidence while maintaining appropriate uncertainty given the lack of direct voter preference data.",
