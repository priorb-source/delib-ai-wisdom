  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days (from April 21, 2025 to May 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy as of April 21, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens delays her announcement due to strategic considerations, decides to wait for better timing after May 1st, or ultimately decides to remain in the House rather than run for Senate. Unexpected political developments or personal considerations could also lead her to postpone or forgo the race entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens announces her candidacy in the coming week, consistent with Politico's April 19th report that she was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' She leverages her $1.6 million campaign fund and expanded staff to launch her campaign before the May 1st deadline.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests Stevens is preparing to run: she has $1.6 million in campaign funds, raised $1.2 million in Q1 2025, expanded her campaign staff, and is contacting potential House replacements. Most significantly, Politico reported on April 19th that she was 'widely expected to declare... as early as next week,' which would be the week of April 21-27, well before the May 1st deadline. However, three factors temper this forecast: (1) she has not filed FEC paperwork for an exploratory committee, (2) other outlets used more ambiguous language ('coming weeks' rather than 'next week'), and (3) the status quo is that she has not announced. With only 10 days remaining, there's limited time for the announcement to occur. The forecast is not higher because there's no official filing yet and political timelines often slip. It's not lower because the Politico reporting is specific and recent, and all indicators point toward an imminent run. I would update higher if Stevens files FEC paperwork or if additional sources confirm an imminent announcement. I would update lower if we reach April 28th without an announcement or if reports emerge of her reconsidering.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
