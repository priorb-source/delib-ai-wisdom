    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with forecasts tightly clustered between 14% and 18%. We all identify the same core drivers: the stated reasons for the closure (terrorism, arms smuggling) are severe and not easily resolved; historical precedents for security-related border closures in the region point to long durations; and the timeline for resolution before July 1 is extremely short. \n\nForecaster 2 correctly emphasized that the May 30 AFRICOM report noted a *deteriorating* security environment, which is a crucial detail suggesting the situation is actively worsening, not stabilizing. Forecaster 3 introduced a key piece of evidence I had not fully weighted: that Benin extended its security operations to other border areas like Sèmè and Owode. This suggests a broadening of Benin's security concerns, making a quick, isolated reversal at the Kwara border less likely. This argument, in particular, is highly convincing and serves as a strong bearish signal.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%, based on the low probability of resolving serious security issues within a short timeframe. The deliberation with my colleagues has reinforced this view and prompted a slight downward adjustment. The key factors strengthening the 'No' case are the AFRICOM report of a *deteriorating* threat environment and, as highlighted by Forecaster 3, Benin's decision to extend security measures to other border crossings. This escalation indicates a hardening and widening of Benin's security posture, making a swift policy reversal at the Kwara border highly improbable. \n\nWhile countervailing factors like political pressure from Nigeria's legislature and economic harm to local communities exist, they are unlikely to overcome the primary security imperatives in such a compressed timeline. The path to a 'Yes' outcome would require a sudden and dramatic improvement in the security situation or a high-level diplomatic agreement that overrides the stated concerns, neither of which appears imminent. The new evidence suggests negative momentum. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast slightly to reflect an even stronger conviction that the border will remain closed past the deadline.",
