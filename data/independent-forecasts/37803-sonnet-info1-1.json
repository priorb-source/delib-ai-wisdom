  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The site remains DOWN. As of May 5, 2025, climate.mil was confirmed down, and there are no indications of imminent restoration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains its current policy direction. Secretary Hegseth's statements about climate being 'nonsense' and DoD focusing on 'war-fighting' reflect sustained policy priorities. No legal challenges or political pressure sufficient to force restoration emerge in the 6-week timeframe. The site remains offline through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A legal challenge based on transparency, archival, or information access laws forces rapid restoration. Alternatively, congressional oversight pressure or international treaty obligations create sufficient political pressure for restoration. Less likely: the administration reverses its climate stance, or career bureaucrats restore the site through existing processes without explicit high-level authorization.",
    "rationale": "Strong evidence favors the status quo (site remaining down). The site has already been offline for at least 2 weeks, demonstrating this is not a temporary technical issue. Secretary Hegseth's explicit statements ('climate nonsense,' DoD 'not concerned with climate') indicate deliberate policy. The revocation of the January 2021 climate executive order shows systematic removal of climate initiatives. With only 6 weeks until resolution, significant changes are unlikely given how slowly government processes move. Factors potentially increasing probability: legal challenges under transparency laws, congressional pressure, or international obligations could force restoration. However, no reporting suggests such challenges are imminent or progressing rapidly. The Trump administration has shown consistency in climate policy reversals across agencies, suggesting coordination rather than ad-hoc decisions that might be easily reversed. My forecast is not lower (below 8%) because: legal/transparency obligations could create unexpected pressure, some automated restoration processes might exist, or career staff might act independently. My forecast is not higher (above 15%) because: explicit policy statements from leadership, the short timeframe, no evidence of mounting pressure, and the administration's demonstrated commitment to reversing climate initiatives across government. I would update higher if: lawsuits were filed seeking immediate restoration, congressional hearings scheduled, or reports of internal restoration efforts. I would update lower if: additional explicit policy directives emerged or other military climate resources were removed.",
