  "information": "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. NOAA typically releases monthly climate data within the first two weeks of the following month, and today is June 2, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 is very warm but does not break the May temperature record. While 2025 is expected to be one of the hottest years overall, not every individual month necessarily breaks its specific monthly record.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 is warmer than average but falls short of the previous May record (likely set in 2024 or 2023) by a few hundredths of a degree. This could occur due to transitioning El Niño conditions, regional weather patterns that moderated global temperatures, or particularly high ocean temperatures in the previous record-setting May that weren't quite matched.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 continues the trend of exceptional global warmth with sustained high ocean temperatures, strong greenhouse gas forcing, and favorable atmospheric circulation patterns. The month edges out the previous May record by a small margin, continuing the pattern of frequent monthly temperature records seen in recent years.",
    "rationale": "The key factors influencing this forecast are: (1) the strong overall warming trend that has produced numerous monthly records in 2023-2024, (2) forecasts indicating 2025 will be among the top 3-5 hottest years on record per the research assistant's report, and (3) the transition away from El Niño conditions which typically moderates global temperatures. The research assistant notes that summer 2025 is expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal,' particularly in the U.S., which suggests continued warmth but doesn't specifically address May.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: El Niño conditions are waning, which historically leads to some cooling; not every month breaks records even in exceptionally warm years (2024 didn't break every monthly record); and May 2024 or 2023 may have set an extremely high bar requiring exceptional conditions to surpass.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: the multi-decadal warming trend remains strong; 2025 is forecast to be exceptionally warm overall; and recent years have shown a pattern of frequent monthly records, suggesting the baseline has shifted upward significantly.\n\nI would update my forecast higher if: early NOAA data leaks or preliminary reports suggested May 2025 was exceptionally warm; El Niño conditions persisted longer than expected; or ocean heat content remained at record levels. I would update lower if: preliminary data showed May was only moderately warm; La Niña conditions developed earlier than expected; or volcanic activity or other cooling factors emerged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
