    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identify the same core tension: the institutional inertia and explicit NOAA promises supporting a 'Yes' outcome versus the administration's demonstrated anti-climate-science actions representing the primary risk for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 both introduced a crucial nuance that I had not explicitly detailed: the distinction between past actions (like decommissioning a database or cutting staff) and the much more public, politically costly act of taking down a major website like Climate.gov. This argument is highly convincing and, rather than increasing the perceived risk, it actually helps explain why the site has remained online despite the hostile political environment, thereby strengthening the case for a 'Yes' resolution in the short term.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation with my peers has reinforced, not weakened, my initial assessment. The key argument that the political cost and public visibility of taking down Climate.gov is significantly higher than for other actions already taken (e.g., decommissioning the 'Billion-Dollar Disasters' database) is a critical point. This suggests a higher bar for action against the main website. The direct and recent statement from a NOAA spokesperson on April 4, 2025, promising to keep the sites online, was likely made with this political calculus in mind. Breaking such a public promise so quickly carries risks for the agency and administration. While the general political intent to dismantle such resources is clear and represents a real threat, this specific, highly visible action seems unlikely to be executed in the short ~40-day timeframe remaining. The 5% chance of a 'No' outcome adequately accounts for the small but non-zero possibility of a sudden executive order or directive overriding these practical and political barriers.",
