  "information": "As of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to signal interest, does donor/outreach groundwork, but opts to wait until later in 2025 to formally declare—especially if Miami moves its election to 2026, extending his term and reducing any perceived urgency to announce now.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He lines up key donors and endorsements and seeks to seize early attention by holding a late-June launch event or issuing a clear public statement that he is running for governor, with accompanying press and filings.",
    "rationale": "- Time factor: With only about 26 days left, the base-rate for a formal gubernatorial announcement in that short window—15 months before a 2026 primary—seems modest. Many likely contenders in Florida appear to be waiting; there is no clear forcing mechanism that makes a pre-July 1 announcement especially advantageous.\n- Current signals: The research assistant notes Axios reported on May 2 that Suarez is weighing a bid and that a May poll has him at 5% in the GOP field. That suggests he is exploring but not yet competitive, which typically argues for more groundwork before announcing. No reports of imminent staff hires, scheduled launch events, or donor summits tied to a firm date were cited.\n- Incentives and timing: If the Miami City Commission moves the city’s November election to 2026, extending terms by a year, Suarez’s need to announce quickly diminishes further; he could remain in office while building a statewide campaign and pick a later launch. If the change does not pass, there is still no obvious catalyst that requires a June announcement.\n- Status quo weighting: In the absence of concrete “announcement soon” indicators (e.g., venue holds, media advisories, committee rebranding, statewide tour dates), the status quo—no announcement in the next few weeks—is the safer default.\nWhy not higher: We lack evidence of imminent action (no credible reporting of an announcement date, hiring a campaign manager, or major donor commitments to be unveiled soon). The poll at 5% and broader field uncertainty lessen the incentive to jump first.\nWhy not lower: Suarez is actively considering the race and could move quickly if he perceives a strategic opening. Early announcements do occur, and a single high-profile event or press release would satisfy the criterion.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a scheduled announcement/event, formation or renaming of a state committee clearly for a gubernatorial run plus media advisories, major donor confirmations, or a leak to top Florida outlets that an end-of-June launch is imminent.\nWhat would move me down: Public statements pushing a decision to “later this year,” confirmation that he will wait on the Miami election-timing decision or other milestones, or fresh negative developments that make a June rollout unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
