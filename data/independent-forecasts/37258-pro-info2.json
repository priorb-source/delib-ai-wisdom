  "information": "In January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Scottish government continues to focus on other policy areas and does not announce a date for an independence referendum by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government, led by First Minister John Swinney, prioritizes its stated goals of improving the economy, reducing child poverty, and bolstering public services. The government sees the May 2026 Holyrood elections as the next key milestone for the independence movement, and therefore does not make any referendum announcement in the short period before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a sudden UK-wide political crisis or a series of polls showing a dramatic and sustained surge in independence support, the Scottish government makes a surprise strategic decision to announce a referendum date. This is done to capitalize on political momentum and rally the pro-independence base ahead of the 2026 Holyrood elections, even if the legal basis for the referendum is uncertain.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away, which is an exceptionally short timeframe for such a significant political announcement. The information provided indicates the Scottish government's current strategic focus, as of April 2025, is on the economy, child poverty, and public services, not on an imminent referendum. This suggests that while independence remains a long-term goal, it is not the immediate legislative or political priority. This position is reinforced by influential figures. Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated a referendum is 'off the radar' for the short term, and the opposition Scottish Labour party has confirmed it will not support one. This broad political context points away from any impending announcement. The probability is not lower than 5% because of the inherent volatility of politics. A sudden, unforeseen event—such as a major crisis in the UK government—could create a window of opportunity that the SNP might feel compelled to seize. An announcement could also be used as a symbolic political maneuver to energize the independence movement. However, this is a low-probability scenario. The probability is not higher because the available evidence from government announcements and key political figures overwhelmingly points to a focus on issues other than a referendum in the immediate future. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see a clear and sustained shift in polling in favor of independence, coupled with senior Scottish government ministers publicly signaling an imminent change in strategy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
