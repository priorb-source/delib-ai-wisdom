    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate and incentive/relationship assessment. Useful additions: (1) YC being perceived as Altman’s turf could further reduce Musk’s willingness to share a stage (Forecaster 2) — a solid directional consideration. (2) Musk’s mid‑June scheduling risks (e.g., typical timing of Tesla’s shareholder meeting) add execution risk (Forecaster 3) — plausible, though not confirmed for the exact dates. Points I find weak: Forecaster 3 references “conciliatory signals”/an “olive branch,” which I haven’t seen substantiated; I discount that. Both emphasize that absent explicit agenda signaling, joint appearances between rivals are uncommon — consistent with my prior. Net: no decisive new evidence to move materially; if anything, the YC-as-Altman-turf point slightly lowers odds, while the possibility of a surprise YC capstone keeps a nontrivial tail.",
    "rationale": "The modal conference format is separate keynotes/firesides for marquee speakers; joint rival sessions are typically pre-promoted. The Altman–Musk rivalry and brand competition (OpenAI vs. xAI) make a shared stage less attractive for either, and YC may wish to avoid a sideshow that overshadows a student-focused event. Execution risk (Musk’s schedule variability, potential remote participation) is another drag. Countervailing factors: both are confirmed headliners at a two-day, single-venue event; YC could engineer a surprise joint segment or brief closing moment that satisfies the “same stage” criterion. However, with no agenda or credible hints of a joint segment as of May 27, the base-rate remains low. The other forecasters’ arguments mostly reinforce this view; the only new, credible point (YC as Altman turf) would, if anything, push down. Given no verified positive signals, I keep my estimate essentially unchanged.",
