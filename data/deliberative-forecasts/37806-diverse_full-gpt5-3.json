    "review": "Both forecasters fairly weigh Trump’s hostility to the DV program and the short time window. I agree with their emphasis that only a mention is required (not policy effect), which slightly increases the plausibility. However, I find their probabilities high given: (1) the strong revealed priority ordering—many immigration actions, none mentioning DV so far; (2) the site taxonomy constraint that it must be a “Presidential Action” (EO/proclamation/memorandum/notice/message), whereas most political messaging to pressure Congress appears in “Statements,” which would not count; (3) the phrasing friction—formal documents often use “Diversity Immigrant Visa” or “visa lottery,” and while “Diversity Visa Program” would qualify, it’s not guaranteed they’ll choose that wording; (4) the lack of any reporting or draft signals aimed specifically at DV in the next ~6 weeks. The “triggering event” scenario is possible but speculative with a low base rate. I do give some weight to a catch‑all immigration EO or memo that includes a review of the DV program and uses the qualifying phrase, which nudges me slightly upward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: The program is statutory and operating. The administration has been prolific on immigration but has not mentioned “Diversity Visa” in any Presidential Action yet. That pattern points to a No absent a specific push.\n- Pathways to Yes: A broad immigration EO/memo instructing review/tightening of the “Diversity Visa Program,” or a message to Congress under Presidential Actions explicitly naming it, would qualify. The SAFE for America Act could prompt a supportive presidential message that mentions DV, though such messages often appear outside the Presidential Actions section.\n- Headwinds: Legal durability favors legislation; White House may avoid program‑specific EOs that invite litigation when Congress is already moving a bill. The precise publication requirement (must appear under Presidential Actions) and phrasing uncertainty reduce odds. No press reporting or leaks indicate an imminent DV‑specific section in an EO.\n- Timing: ~6 weeks remain—enough for one or two major immigration actions, but the prior omission across many actions is informative.\nNet: I slightly raise my estimate to reflect the possibility of a broad immigration action including a DV reference, but remain below the other forecasters because the taxonomy/wording constraints and revealed priorities keep the base odds modest.",
