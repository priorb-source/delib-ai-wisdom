  "information": "As of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days. The question resolves based on whether a country signs the Artemis Accords between May 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025. We will know the outcome by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo would be that no country signs the Artemis Accords in June 2025, as there are currently no public announcements of planned signings during this specific timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No country signs the Artemis Accords during June 2025. This could occur if ongoing diplomatic negotiations with potential signatories extend beyond June, if countries delay their signing for strategic or domestic political reasons, or if the competing ILRS project draws away potential partners.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more countries sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025. This could happen if a country that has been quietly negotiating finalizes their decision quickly, if the US State Department successfully accelerates diplomatic efforts to secure new signatories, or if a signing ceremony is scheduled during a relevant international space or diplomatic event in June.",
    "rationale": "The recent signing pattern shows meaningful momentum: Bangladesh signed on April 8, 2025, and Norway signed on May 15, 2025. This represents two signings in approximately 5-6 weeks, suggesting active diplomatic engagement. However, my research assistant reports no public announcements of countries planning to sign in June 2025, which is a significant negative indicator since diplomatic signings of this nature typically involve advance notice and coordination. The base rate analysis suggests roughly 1 signing per month based on recent activity, but diplomatic events are inherently 'lumpy' and don't follow regular schedules. Several factors temper my forecast: (1) The competing ILRS project with 17 partner countries may be drawing away potential signatories, (2) International agreements require substantial preparation and domestic approval processes, (3) June 2025 represents only a 31-day window, and (4) the absence of announced plans is meaningful given that signings usually involve ceremonial preparation. I'm not going higher because there's no concrete evidence of imminent signings, and diplomatic processes rarely happen on a one-month timeline without prior signals. I'm not going lower because the demonstrated recent momentum and the growing signatory base (55 countries) suggest ongoing interest and active diplomatic channels. I would update higher if: announcements emerge of scheduled signing ceremonies, diplomatic sources indicate countries in final stages of joining, or international space events in June create signing opportunities. I would update lower if: competing initiatives gain traction, geopolitical tensions increase, or we move further into June without any signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
