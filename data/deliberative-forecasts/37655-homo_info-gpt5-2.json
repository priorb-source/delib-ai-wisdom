    "review": "New, specific detail from Forecaster 2—that the Verkhovna Rada extended martial law to August 6, 2025 on May 15—and the reminder about the 90‑day statutory lead time to set a presidential election date are the most salient additions. That extension moves beyond the July 1 cutoff and reinforces the default: no announcement while martial law persists. Forecaster 3’s point that there is no procedural need to announce before July 1 for an October election further lowers the incentive to act in June. I agree with both on the legal/operational barriers and the typical practice of not scheduling elections during martial law. Where I diverge is on likelihood: 18% seems too high given the fresh extension, the executive’s repeated denials, lack of enabling legal moves, and no deadline pressure before July 1. Forecaster 2’s 3% feels closer to the mark. The only credible path to Yes by July 1 is a political decision to pre‑announce a fall date despite martial law, which would require a Rada resolution—an atypical and costly move absent a ceasefire or major shift. I find the low‑single‑digit range more defensible.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~46 days. Status quo: martial law now extended through August 6; Ukraine has consistently avoided even scheduling national elections under martial law. Authority: a Yes requires a Verkhovna Rada resolution naming a specific date; statements by the President’s Office alone wouldn’t qualify. Incentives/timing: If aiming for an October date (e.g., Oct 26), the 90‑day requirement implies a late‑July announcement is sufficient, reducing pressure to act before July 1. Signals: the President’s Office recently denied July‑2025 election planning; there are no visible legislative preparations to enable wartime voting or to pre‑commit to a date. Tail scenarios for a Yes include a political decision to pre‑announce a fall date to signal democratic intent or in response to dramatic security improvements or coordinated international pressure. These are conceivable but unlikely in the next six weeks. Given the fresh extension to August 6 and lack of deadline pressure, I’m nudging down from 6% to 4%. I would move up if a draft Rada resolution setting a fall date appears, if top leadership signals readiness to schedule, or if there’s credible movement to lift/modify martial law earlier than expected; I’d move down further on renewed fighting or categorical reiterations that no scheduling will occur under martial law.",
