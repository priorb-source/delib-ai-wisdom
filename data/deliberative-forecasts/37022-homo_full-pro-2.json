    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus on the core quantitative drivers affecting Ukraine's government debt in March 2025. We all identified the same three key factors: the IMF loan tranche (~16 billion UAH), domestic bond issuance (~26 billion UAH), and currency depreciation effects (~10 billion UAH). All of our analyses concluded that these factors alone would push the debt well over the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis is nearly identical to my own, both in reasoning and in the final 95% probability. This strengthens my confidence in the initial assessment.\n\nForecaster 3's reasoning on the drivers is also aligned, but they arrived at a more cautious 90% forecast. They placed greater weight on uncertainties such as the exact accounting-day for the inflows and the unknown size of debt servicing costs. While I acknowledge these are the correct sources of uncertainty, I find a 10% chance of failure (a net negative impact of over 21 billion UAH from these factors) to be too high given the magnitude of the identified inflows and the description of debt servicing as 'modest'. Forecaster 2's framing of these as 'tail risks' better aligns with my own view.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast. My reasoning remains unchanged and has been reinforced by the deliberation. The core of my forecast is a simple quantitative assessment. The debt level at the end of February was 1.869 trillion UAH, requiring an increase of approximately 31 billion UAH to resolve as 'Yes'.\n\nThe known and quantified events in March strongly support an increase far exceeding this amount:\n1.  IMF loan disbursement: +16 billion UAH\n2.  Domestic bond auctions: +26 billion UAH\n3.  Hryvnia depreciation effect: +9-11 billion UAH\n\nThese factors sum to a conservative estimate of a ~52 billion UAH increase. This creates a substantial buffer of ~21 billion UAH above the required threshold. For the outcome to be 'No', unquantified factors such as debt servicing costs and accounting adjustments would need to create a net outflow of over 21 billion UAH. This seems highly improbable, especially since debt servicing was described as 'modest'. Therefore, I am confident that the threshold was crossed. I am not increasing my forecast above 95% because there is always a small, non-zero chance of data reporting errors, lags, or a significant, unannounced debt repayment. However, the available evidence strongly supports a 'Yes' resolution.",
