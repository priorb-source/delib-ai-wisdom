    "review": "The other forecasters make several valuable points that strengthen my analysis. Both emphasize the legal challenge dimension more explicitly than I did - noting that even if termination is announced, legal injunctions could prevent the tracker from marking it complete. Forecaster 3's point about PSLF being established by federal statute (not just regulation) is particularly important, as this makes administrative termination much harder and more vulnerable to legal challenge. Forecaster 2's observation that 'no information suggests imminent completion' is a crucial piece of negative evidence I should have weighted more heavily. Both forecasters independently arrived at 20%, suggesting a natural consensus point in this range. However, I note they don't present fundamentally new information beyond emphasizing legal obstacles and the statutory nature of the program more strongly than I did.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I was slightly too low at 15%. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that legal challenges would likely delay even announced terminations, and the statutory basis of PSLF makes termination more complex than I initially weighted. The fact that two independent analysts both reached 20% suggests this is a reasonable focal point. However, I maintain some skepticism about reaching even 20% because: (1) the 48-day timeframe remains extraordinarily tight for any major policy change; (2) the complete absence of news about imminent completion actions is meaningful negative evidence; (3) the tracker maintainers would likely require very clear evidence before marking such a significant objective as 'complete.' I'm updating upward to acknowledge the valid clustering and the strength of their legal obstacle arguments, but staying slightly below 20% because I believe the time constraint is particularly binding and the lack of any signals about imminent action is telling. My updated forecast of 18% reflects this balanced view - acknowledging their valid points while maintaining independent judgment on the binding nature of the timeline.",
