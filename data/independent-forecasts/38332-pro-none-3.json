    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government either continues its deliberation past the July 1 deadline without making an announcement, or decides to send a lower-level delegate like the Foreign Minister instead of the President to balance its geopolitical interests, which would not meet the resolution criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the ideological alignment with Brazil's President Lula and seeking economic opportunities, President Orsi's administration decides that attending the summit is a strategic priority. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the President's office issues a press release in mid-to-late June confirming his participation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong political and economic incentives for President Orsi to accept the invitation. Orsi's center-left Broad Front coalition is ideologically aligned with Brazilian President Lula da Silva's government, making diplomatic cooperation more likely. Furthermore, as a trade-dependent nation, Uruguay has a pragmatic interest in strengthening ties with the BRICS economies, particularly Brazil and China, its key trading partners. Attending a summit hosted by a major neighbor and ally is a low-cost way to pursue these interests, and refusing a personal invitation could strain the bilateral relationship. The status quo is 'No,' as no announcement has been made since the invitation in March, which is the main reason for uncertainty. However, the fundamental drivers point towards an eventual acceptance. My probability is not higher because the delay in announcing a decision, with less than a month to go, suggests there may be internal debate about the geopolitical signal it would send to Western partners like the United States. An announcement of a lower-level delegate attending would also resolve this question as 'No'. My probability is not lower because the combination of a personal invitation from an ideologically aligned and crucial regional partner makes a refusal the less probable and more diplomatically costly option. I would increase my forecast if there were leaks or official statements hinting at preparations for the trip, and decrease it if prominent opposition figures voiced strong criticism or if scheduling conflicts were announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
