    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully spotlights a key hinge I hadn’t explicitly modeled: whether FlightsFrom includes the inter‑island Saipan–Rota (ROP) and Saipan–Tinian (TIQ) services. If both are listed as scheduled in OAG/GDS, they add two destinations at once and make a Yes much more attainable. However, I think F2 overweights this, as inclusion is uncertain (small carriers aren’t always captured on FlightsFrom unless fully filed). Forecaster 3’s caution about (a) United’s NRT–SPN being non‑guaranteed and (b) seasonal/charter Korean routes needing to be filed as scheduled to count is well taken and keeps the bar for reaching five higher. I find F3’s base-case reasoning solid but slightly too conservative given summer seasonality and current marketing pushes that suggest NRT and PUS are reasonably likely to operate. Net: F2 adds a plausible upside catalyst (inter‑island inclusion), while F3 credibly tempers expectations on new routes materializing by early July and the fragility of NRT. I modestly raise my forecast to reflect the inter‑island pathway but stay well below 50% due to inclusion uncertainty and limited lead time for new international routes.",
    "rationale": "Path to >4 requires at least five listed destinations on FlightsFrom on/after July 1. The likely baseline set for early July is: Guam (very likely), ICN (very likely), plus PUS and NRT as the swing routes. I put the probability both PUS and NRT operate in early July around 60%, yielding a robust four. Getting to five then needs one additional destination from: (1) inter‑island ROP/TIQ being listed (if filed as scheduled), (2) Hong Kong (HKA), (3) an added Korean secondary city (e.g., CJJ/TAE/MWX), (4) an additional Japan city (KIX/NGO), or (5) Taipei/Manila. Of these, (1) is the single biggest swing because it adds two destinations at once, but I only assign ~20–30% that FlightsFrom includes them consistently. The rest each look low‑probability without visible schedule filings this close to July. Rough aggregation: - P(base four) ≈ 0.6; conditional on that, P(any one extra) ≈ 0.4–0.45. - If one of PUS/NRT is missing (base three), P(reaching five) leans heavily on inter‑island inclusion; otherwise the chance of two other new scheduled cities is small. - If both are missing (unlikely), hitting five becomes quite hard absent inter‑island plus one more. Incorporating these scenarios moves me slightly up from 28% to the low‑30s: the inter‑island inclusion channel is real but uncertain; new international additions by July 1 still look unlikely. I would move higher on confirmed OAG/FlightsFrom listings showing ROP/TIQ, or a filed HKG or additional KR/Japan city operating in early July; lower if NRT or PUS aren’t filed for July.",
