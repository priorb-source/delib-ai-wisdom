    "review": "My initial forecast of 95% was based heavily on bureaucratic inertia, arguing that a substantive policy change and corresponding website update was highly improbable in a six-week timeframe. Both other forecasters concurred with the core of this argument. However, they introduced a key nuance I had under-weighted: the distinction between a formal policy change and a rapid, politically-motivated editorial change. Forecaster 3 articulated this perfectly, noting the main risk is a 'quick content refresh for political optics' that could happen much faster than rulemaking. Forecaster 2 provided a potential catalyst for such a change: an 'upcoming USDA reorganization announcement in late May 2025.' This specific event provides a concrete mechanism by which a new administration could direct a symbolic, cosmetic update to public-facing materials like this website page to signal a new policy direction. Their arguments collectively persuaded me that my initial 5% probability for a 'No' outcome was too low, as it did not sufficiently account for the risk of a low-cost, high-visibility symbolic action.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 95% to 90%. The core of my original analysis remains unchanged: the default outcome is 'Yes' due to the very short timeframe (less than six weeks) and the immense bureaucratic inertia that slows formal policy changes and even minor website updates within the federal government. A change in the Food and Nutrition Act or a completed notice-and-comment rulemaking process by July 1st is virtually impossible.\n\nHowever, after reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing the probability of a 'No' outcome from 5% to 10%. This adjustment is driven entirely by their convincing arguments about the possibility of a rapid, symbolic editorial change made for political reasons. While a substantive policy change is not feasible, a politically appointed leader could direct a communications team to make a minor text edit—such as removing the specific phrase 'snack foods'—as a way to signal intent and cater to a political base. As Forecaster 2 pointed out, a potential upcoming USDA announcement could serve as the trigger for such a directive. This type of communication-level change can sometimes bypass the slower, more deliberate processes that govern formal guidance. While I still believe the default is for the page to remain unchanged, I now see a more significant, non-trivial risk of this specific editorial action occurring before the resolution date.",
