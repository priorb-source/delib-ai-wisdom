  "information": "Florida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 regular session adjourned without passing any bill that adds documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters. No special session is called that includes this topic, and no previously passed bill of this kind is sent to or signed by the governor before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A bill like HB 831 (or a companion/omnibus elections bill with similar provisions) passes both chambers and is enrolled near the end of session, then is signed by Gov. DeSantis (or becomes law without his signature) before July 1. Alternatively, leadership calls a quick special session in May/June that includes an elections package adding proof-of-citizenship requirements for some subset of voters (e.g., first-time registrants or state-only elections), and it is enacted before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Legislative timing: Florida’s regular session typically adjourns in early May. As of May 6, 2025, there is no credible reporting that a proof-of-citizenship requirement has passed both chambers. If it did not pass during regular session, the remaining paths are (a) it actually passed late and is awaiting the governor’s action, or (b) a special session is called and includes this topic. The former would likely have been widely reported; the latter is possible but uncommon for election law changes without an urgent catalyst.\n- Political environment: Republicans hold supermajorities and Gov. DeSantis has a track record of signing “election integrity” measures. The research assistant notes two 2025 measures tightening citizens’ initiative rules (including banning non-citizens/non-residents from gathering signatures) and a general willingness to regulate elections. That increases baseline odds that leadership would support stricter verification at some point, but it doesn’t ensure action before July 1.\n- Legal friction: Requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration intersects with federal law (e.g., NVRA) and prior litigation (e.g., Arizona/Kansas). Even if courts are immaterial to resolution, this legal backdrop can make leadership more cautious and slow the process, reducing short-term enactment odds.\n- Status quo weight: Most bills—even in friendly chambers—do not become law, and election changes of this magnitude are often routed through regular session packages. With the session effectively over, inertia favors no enactment by July 1 unless the bill already passed or a special session is convened.\nWhy not higher: No clear evidence of passage by sine die; special sessions on this specific topic are not the norm; legal complexity reduces urgency.\nWhy not lower: GOP control and governor alignment, plus 2025 activity on adjacent election topics, mean a nontrivial chance that a proof-of-citizenship measure was folded into a late-session package or could be added to a short special session and enacted quickly.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports that HB 831 or a companion cleared both chambers; placement on the governor’s desk; announcement of a special session including voter citizenship verification; strong public push from leadership or the governor naming this as a priority before July.\nWhat would move me down: Confirmation that HB 831 (and any companion) died in committees or on the calendar; adjournment with no elections omnibus containing these provisions; clear indications that any special session will be limited to unrelated topics (e.g., budget, insurance).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
