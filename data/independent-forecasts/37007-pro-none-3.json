    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and results are typically known within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM), as the incumbent party that won the 2020 election, wins a plurality of seats and retains power.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition United National Congress (UNC) successfully leverages public discontent over economic issues and crime rates, achieving a small but decisive swing in a few key marginal constituencies, thereby winning a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages the advantages of incumbency, rallies its base, and persuades voters in marginal seats that its leadership offers greater stability, resulting in a narrow victory to secure a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the principle of incumbency advantage in a historically stable two-party system. The People's National Movement (PNM) is the current governing party, having won the 2020 election with 22 seats to the United National Congress's (UNC) 19. In the absence of specific polling data or major event-driven news (as indicated by the research assistant's report of 'No additional information available'), the status quo is the most significant factor. Trinidad and Tobago's elections are often very close, decided by a handful of marginal seats, with voting patterns strongly influenced by established party loyalties. The lack of information about any major scandal, economic shock, or significant shift in campaign momentum leads me to favor the incumbent, as the burden of proof is on the opposition to persuade voters to change. My forecast is not higher because the historical closeness of these elections means that even a small swing in public opinion could flip the result. A 3-seat majority is a narrow margin to defend. Persistent national issues like crime and economic performance create a constant potential for anti-incumbent sentiment. My forecast is not lower because there is no positive evidence to suggest the UNC has gained the necessary momentum to overcome the PNM's incumbency advantage. A probability below 50% would imply the opposition is the favorite, which is not supported by the available information. I would increase my forecast with credible polling showing a clear PNM lead in marginal seats. Conversely, I would decrease it if late polls indicated a lead for the UNC or if a significant scandal involving the PNM government were to emerge in the final week.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
