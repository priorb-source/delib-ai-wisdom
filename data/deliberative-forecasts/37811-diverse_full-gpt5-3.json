    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view: status quo inertia and a recent, explicit NOAA assurance strongly favor Yes over a short horizon. They emphasize two points worth weighting: (1) the political/organizational risk remains real given ongoing aggressive cuts and alignment with Project 2025; (2) breaking a fresh public commitment would be highly visible and costly, which dampens near-term takedown odds. They also highlight the internal memo contemplating site downtime as a concrete sign that shutdown was on the table. None of this overturns the base case, but it argues for a bit more caution than an ultra‑high forecast. I didn’t see genuinely new factual evidence beyond what was already in the assistant’s report, but I agree with their calibration instincts and their emphasis on bureaucratic slowness and the visibility cost of removing a major portal.",
    "rationale": "Climate.gov is up as of May 7 and falls under NOAA/OAR, which publicly committed on Apr 4 that all NOAA Research sites will remain online. Over a 41‑day window, government web domains are usually stable; even aggressive content changes tend to keep sites reachable or redirected. The Yes outcome only requires the site to be reachable when Metaculus checks via IsItDownRightNow on/after July 1. Key residual risks: (a) political decision to consolidate or retire Climate.gov without a clean redirect; (b) operational issues stemming from staffing cuts (DNS/cert lapse, hosting hiccup) that could coincide with the single check; (c) the earlier internal memo considering potential downtime shows some appetite/tolerance for site takedowns, modestly increasing risk. Balancing the explicit NOAA assurance and short timeline against these risks, I trim slightly from my prior 94% to reflect both the memo’s signal and the single‑check vulnerability, while still strongly favoring continuity.",
