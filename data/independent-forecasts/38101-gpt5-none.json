    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Starmer narrowly ahead of Ishiba in approval on Morning Consult, but within a few points",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba’s approval equals or exceeds Starmer’s on the July 1 snapshot (a tie also resolves No). This could happen if Ishiba gets a short-term bump (e.g., successful policy rollout, diplomatic win, or disaster response) or if Starmer sees a dip (e.g., negative headlines about the budget, NHS pressures, tax debates, or an economic wobble) that trims a small lead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer maintains a modest edge (e.g., 1–4 points) into July as approvals drift slowly absent shocks; Ishiba’s post-honeymoon normalization keeps him in the low-to-mid 30s while Starmer holds roughly mid-30s.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and time horizon: With ~1 month left and Morning Consult using a trailing 7-day average, large swings are uncommon without major events. That favors the current ordering persisting into early July.\n- Comparative base rates: Japanese PM approvals often start high and trend down over months; UK PM approvals after an election win tend to settle in the 30s. Entering mid-2025, the most typical configuration is both leaders in the 30s, with Japan’s PM often a bit lower than his initial honeymoon and the UK PM somewhere mid-30s. That creates a slight edge for Starmer to be higher on a random week in early July.\n- Tie rule: Ties resolve No. Even if Starmer is marginally more likely to be higher, this tie-as-No rule trims the effective probability for Yes.\n- Evidence constraints: The research assistant provided no fresh numbers. I’m weighting base rates, slow drift dynamics over a one-month window, and the likelihood that any single weekly update won’t rerank them unless there’s a salient news shock.\nWhy not higher? Because the likely gap is small (a few points) and the tie rule pushes toward No. Also, late-breaking Japan-specific positives or UK negatives could easily flip a narrow lead.\nWhy not lower? Because absent specific positive news for Ishiba or negative news for Starmer, the slow-moving nature of these series and typical post-honeymoon decay in Japan keep Starmer slightly more likely to be ahead.\nWhat would change my view:\n- Upward revision (higher Yes): Two consecutive Morning Consult updates before July showing Starmer clearly ahead by 3–5 points; UK economic or NHS news stabilizing; Japan headlines on policy missteps or scandals.\n- Downward revision (lower Yes): New data showing them tied or Ishiba ahead; a UK mini-crisis (budget blowback, service disruptions); a Japan diplomatic or domestic policy win giving Ishiba a bump. Also, any indication that Morning Consult’s July 1 window aligns with a stronger Ishiba week.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
