  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current environment of high social and political tension in India surrounding contentious legislation and agricultural issues is likely to produce at least one protest large enough to meet the threshold, consistent with the country's recent history of mass mobilization.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No qualifying protest is reported by the deadline. This could occur if government suppression tactics deter large gatherings, planned protests fail to reach the 10,000-participant threshold, or a qualifying event happens but is not added to the Global Protest Tracker's database before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of several ongoing points of friction, such as protests against the Waqf Act or the planned farmers' march, escalates into a demonstration of 10,000 or more people. The event gains media attention and is consequently cataloged by the Global Protest Tracker within the specified timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high likelihood of a large-scale protest occurring in the short, two-month window, driven by several active social and political flashpoints. India has a recent history of very large protests, such as the 2020-21 farmers' protests, demonstrating the capacity for mass mobilization. The provided intelligence confirms this trend continues, citing multiple recent and planned protests. Specifically, ongoing anger regarding the Waqf Act and other land laws, coupled with a planned march of 10,000 farmers, provides clear potential catalysts for a qualifying event. The status quo is one of simmering unrest that has recently boiled over into violent, albeit smaller, protests. It is probable that one of these movements will organize a larger, central demonstration that meets the 10,000-participant threshold.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of two key uncertainties. First, the effectiveness of government suppression. The state's use of surveillance and punitive measures like confiscating passports could have a chilling effect, keeping attendance numbers below the required threshold. Second, the resolution depends specifically on the Global Protest Tracker. There can be a lag in their reporting, and their database is a curated list, not an exhaustive real-time feed. A protest late in June might not be recorded by July 1.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the presence of multiple, independent sources of major public discontent (religious, agricultural, political) significantly increases the chances that at least one will flare up in the given timeframe. A specifically planned 10,000-person event is a strong piece of evidence.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a major political party or large union called for a nationwide strike or a specific mass rally. I would decrease my forecast if the government announced successful negotiations with protest leaders or if the planned mobilizations were officially called off.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
