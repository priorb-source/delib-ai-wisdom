  "information": "Implementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Libya has not ratified AfCFTA and the criteria have not yet been satisfied",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya continues without ratifying AfCFTA due to ongoing political instability and competing government authorities, making the formal legislative process required for treaty ratification impossible or impractical to complete within the 2-month timeframe",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of Libya's governing authorities successfully completes the ratification process in the next two months, submits the necessary instruments of ratification to the African Union, and the ratification is internationally recognized before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. The question explicitly states the criteria have not yet been satisfied, meaning Libya has not ratified AfCFTA as of May 1, 2025. With only 2 months remaining, the timeframe is extremely compressed for completing what is typically a multi-step governmental process involving legislative approval and formal submission of ratification instruments. Libya faces significant structural barriers to ratification. The country has experienced prolonged political fragmentation with competing authorities in different regions, making coordinated governmental action on international treaties particularly challenging. Formal treaty ratification requires functioning legislative processes and recognized governmental authority, both of which remain contested in Libya. The research assistant's report, while discussing implementation challenges with AfCFTA more broadly, provides no indication that Libya is close to ratification or that this is being actively pursued. The absence of any mention of Libyan ratification efforts is notable. The report focuses on implementation challenges for existing state parties, suggesting Libya remains outside this group. Good forecasters heavily weight the status quo, especially over short timeframes. The world changes slowly, and major governmental actions like treaty ratifications rarely materialize from apparent inaction within 60 days. My forecast is not lower (not 1-2%) because: ratification processes can occasionally move quickly when prioritized; there's some possibility of behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity not yet public; and maintaining epistemic humility about information gaps. My forecast is not higher (not 15-20%) because: no evidence of active ratification process; severe political obstacles in Libya; very short timeframe; and strong status quo bias. To update higher, I would need: credible reports of Libya initiating ratification procedures, political stabilization enabling treaty actions, or statements from Libyan or AU officials indicating imminent ratification. To update lower: only the passage of time with continued inaction, or explicit statements ruling out near-term ratification.",
