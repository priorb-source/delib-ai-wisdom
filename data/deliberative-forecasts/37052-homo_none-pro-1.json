    "review": "The deliberation with the other forecasters was highly valuable and has reinforced my initial forecast. I found Forecaster 2's analysis particularly compelling, as it mirrored my own but with a more explicit quantitative underpinning. Their calculation of a base rate of around 22-24% for a successful coup in a two-month window (based on the period since August 2020) provides a strong analytical anchor. Crucially, they highlighted the ~20-month 'lull' in successful coups since the event in Gabon in August 2023. This is a key piece of evidence that suggests the immediate risk might be slightly lower than a simple extrapolation of the 2020-2023 'coup spike' would suggest. Forecaster 3's argument for 30% is based on the valid premise that the underlying drivers of instability persist. However, I believe their forecast underweights the significance of this recent lull. While the risk factors remain, the lack of a successful outcome for nearly two years is a data point that must be incorporated into a short-term forecast. Therefore, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning for adjusting the base rate slightly downward to 20% to be more persuasive than Forecaster 3's decision to maintain a higher probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 20%. The deliberation has solidified my reasoning rather than changed it. The core of my forecast rests on balancing the high base rate of recent coups against the very short two-month timeframe. As Forecaster 2 calculated, the period since August 2020 has seen approximately seven successful coups in Africa, yielding a raw probability of around 22-24% for a successful coup occurring within our forecast window.\n\nHowever, the single most important factor discussed in the deliberation is the ~20-month period since the last successful coup in Gabon (August 2023). This 'lull' is a significant piece of evidence. While the fundamental drivers of instability—jihadist insurgencies, economic crises, and weak governance—certainly persist, the lack of a successful putsch for this duration suggests that either potential plotters have been deterred or that state resilience has marginally improved. This recent trend argues against using the raw base rate from the 2020-2023 'spike' without adjustment. Therefore, adjusting the probability slightly down from the calculated ~22% to 20% is a prudent way to account for this recent data and the strong general tendency for the status quo to hold over short periods. A 30% forecast feels too high as it seems to disregard this significant lull, while a forecast below 20% would not adequately respect the severe and unresolved systemic risks present in the Sahel and other fragile states.",
