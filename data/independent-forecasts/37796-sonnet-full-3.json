  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 months. The FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 will determine the outcome, with results typically announced during or shortly after the meeting, likely in late June or early July 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on historical patterns, the status quo is that changes DO occur. Of the 17 plenary meetings since 2018, 16 resulted in additions or removals to the grey list (94% rate). Therefore, the expected status quo outcome is YES - that changes will be made.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No jurisdictions are added or removed at the June 2025 plenary. This would require all countries currently pursuing exit to fail to complete requirements in time (Nigeria, Mozambique), the British Virgin Islands listing to be delayed despite expired grace period, and no other countries completing their action plans. This would mirror the rare October 2020 outcome, which occurred under exceptional COVID circumstances.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is added or removed. Nigeria successfully exits after meeting May 2025 deadline. Mozambique is removed following positive feedback from its April 2025 on-site visit. The British Virgin Islands is added after failing to remediate major gaps within its grace period that expired in February 2025. Any of these individual outcomes, or others not yet identified, would result in a YES resolution.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate strongly favors changes occurring - 16 out of 17 plenaries (94%) since 2018 resulted in modifications to the grey list. The single exception was October 2020, a COVID-delayed virtual meeting focused on policy rather than country evaluations. No such exceptional circumstances exist for June 2025.\n\nMultiple specific catalysts support changes:\n\n1. REMOVALS: Nigeria is actively targeting exit by end of May 2025, which aligns perfectly with the June plenary timing. Mozambique completed technical reforms and received positive feedback from its April 2025 on-site visit - a prerequisite for removal. These are strong candidates for removal.\n\n2. ADDITIONS: The British Virgin Islands has major gaps, its remediation grace period expired in February 2025 (over 3 months ago), and the UK has signaled it won't block listing. This appears highly likely to result in addition.\n\n3. February 2025 precedent: The most recent plenary added two jurisdictions (Laos, Nepal) and removed one (Philippines), showing the process remains active.\n\nWhy not higher (98-99%)? There remains execution risk - countries might not fully complete requirements, on-site visits could reveal issues, or bureaucratic timing might not align perfectly. Some uncertainty is warranted despite strong indicators.\n\nWhy not lower (70-85%)? The 94% base rate is overwhelming. Multiple specific jurisdictions are in advanced stages of either exiting or being added. The BVI situation particularly seems very likely to result in addition given the expired grace period and UK's position. Having multiple independent paths to a YES outcome significantly reduces the probability of NO.\n\nTo update lower, I would need evidence that Nigeria and Mozambique are encountering obstacles, or that the BVI listing process is being delayed. To update higher, I would need official confirmations of completed action plans or public statements from FATF indicating imminent changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
