    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the merger remains pending, with no Form 8-K filed announcing termination before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory review (likely CFIUS and any remaining antitrust checks) continues without a definitive block or abandonment. The parties keep negotiating remedies/assurances, extend timelines if needed, and do not file an 8-K terminating the deal before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A decisive negative trigger arrives (e.g., CFIUS indicates it will recommend a presidential prohibition, the White House signals opposition, or an outside date/condition is missed and not waived), prompting U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel to terminate and file an 8-K before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~1.5 months remain. Large cross-border deals rarely flip from “pending” to “terminated” on such a short fuse absent a clear, scheduled regulatory decision or an imminent drop-dead date.\n- Status quo weight: Good forecasting practice puts extra weight on inertia. The deal has persisted through political turbulence; without a clear, dated catalyst, the base case is continued review rather than an abrupt termination in the next 46 days.\n- Path to a Yes: A Yes requires a formal 8-K termination before July 1. That typically follows either (a) an overt government block (e.g., a presidential decision post-CFIUS) or (b) an outside date lapse that the parties decline to extend. Japan is a close U.S. ally, antitrust overlaps appear limited, and while labor/political opposition is unusual, CFIUS presidential prohibitions are relatively rare. Absent a pre-announced, imminent decision, the probability of such a definitive trigger landing within this short window is modest.\n- Why not higher: There’s no fresh public signal here (per the research assistant: no additional information) of an imminent block or a hard near-term outside date. Government processes often drag rather than conclude abruptly, and parties frequently extend timelines rather than terminate.\n- Why not lower: The deal has been politically sensitive, with bipartisan scrutiny and union opposition, which elevates tail risk that CFIUS/White House pressure or hard-to-meet conditions precipitate a near-term abandonment. If a clear negative regulatory signal surfaces, the termination (and 8-K) could happen quickly within the window.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting that CFIUS is recommending a presidential block; explicit White House opposition; leaks that the parties are preparing to terminate; a disclosed outside date or covenant breach coming due before July 1 that won’t be waived; a sharp widening of the deal spread indicating imminent failure.\n- What would move me down: Signs of regulatory progress or clearance; statements from the companies or officials indicating a path to approval; agreement on mitigation measures; formal extensions of outside dates beyond July.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond confirming no resolution yet; thus I lean on process priors and the short time window to weigh the status quo more heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
