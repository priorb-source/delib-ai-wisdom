  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the cutoff date is July 1, 2025 and an observation is made on May 2, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current Greenlandic government will not officially announce a date for an independence referendum by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Demokraatit-led government follows its stated policy of a gradual path to independence. It prioritizes economic development and continues the work of the multi-year commission for independence negotiations, viewing a referendum in the immediate future as premature. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden political crisis, such as a collapse of the ruling coalition, brings a more pro-independence faction to power. Alternatively, intense pressure from the emboldened Naleraq opposition, combined with a surge in public support, forces the Prime Minister to announce a referendum date as a political concession to maintain stability.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the stated platform and recent actions of the current Greenlandic government. The governing Demokraatit party and Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen explicitly advocate for a gradual, economically-focused approach to independence, not a rushed referendum. This stance was just validated in the March 2025 elections. The establishment of a commission with a multi-year mandate to handle independence negotiations further signals a long-term strategy, making an announcement in the next two months highly improbable as it would contradict their entire political program. While the pro-independence Naleraq party has gained strength, they remain in opposition and lack the power to set the government's agenda. The extremely short timeframe of less than two months makes a major policy reversal on such a critical issue unlikely. My probability is not lower than 5% because political landscapes can be volatile; an unforeseen event or a sudden shift in coalition dynamics could theoretically force the government's hand. It is not higher because the evidence overwhelmingly points towards a deliberate, slow process, and the government has a fresh mandate to pursue that path. I would raise my forecast if the ruling coalition showed signs of fracturing or if Denmark took an action that caused a major nationalist backlash in Greenland.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
