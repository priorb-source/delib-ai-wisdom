  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The summit takes place from June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of June 3, 2025, India has not received an invitation and no high-level preparations for a visit are underway. If this does not change, Prime Minister Modi will not attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Canadian government does not extend a last-minute invitation to India. This could be due to the finalized guest list, short timelines, or lingering diplomatic tensions and domestic political pressure within Canada. Consequently, Prime Minister Modi does not attend the summit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a significant and rapid diplomatic development, perhaps at the urging of other G7 members, Canada extends a late invitation. Viewing the G7 as a critical forum, India's government accepts and successfully fast-tracks the complex logistical and security arrangements for Prime Minister Modi to attend in person.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome based on several key factors. The most critical piece of evidence is that as of June 3, with the summit less than two weeks away, India has not received an invitation while other non-G7 nations have. High-level international visits of this nature require weeks of advance preparation for logistics and security, and the reported absence of such planning in India is a very strong negative indicator. While the new Canadian Prime Minister has expressed a desire to improve relations, this has not yet translated into a reversal of the diplomatic chill. Furthermore, the reported domestic pressure on the Canadian government from Sikh organizations creates a political barrier to a last-minute invitation.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because last-minute diplomatic resolutions, while rare, are not impossible. A strong push from a key ally like the United States, for example, could theoretically change the calculus for Canada. The new Canadian government might also see it as a bold gesture to reset the relationship.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the logistical and political obstacles are substantial. The lack of an invitation this close to the event is an unambiguous diplomatic signal that is highly unlikely to be reversed. For me to update my forecast towards 'Yes', there would need to be credible reports of an official invitation being extended. Conversely, an official confirmation of the guest list from Canada that excludes India would cause me to lower my forecast further.",
