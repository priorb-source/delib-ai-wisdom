    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent and thorough analyses that largely align with my own. We all agree on the primary drivers favoring a 'No' outcome: the extremely short time window, the lack of any preparatory signals, the immense logistical and security challenges, and the severe political backlash a visit to Moscow would provoke during the ongoing Ukraine war. I found two arguments particularly clarifying. First, Forecaster 2's point that Donald Trump never visited Russia during his entire first presidency is a powerful piece of base-rate evidence. Second, Forecaster 3's emphasis on the alternative of a neutral-venue summit (like Helsinki in 2018) is a crucial consideration. This option would allow Trump to pursue personal diplomacy with far lower political costs, making a direct visit to Moscow an unnecessarily risky and less probable choice.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. Their arguments, particularly concerning the historical precedent of no visits in Trump's first term and the high likelihood of a neutral-venue summit being the preferred alternative, have reinforced my conviction that a visit to Russia specifically is extremely improbable. While we all acknowledge Trump's capacity for unconventional actions, the existence of a much more politically palatable option (a neutral-site meeting) makes the specific scenario of a visit *to Russia* even less likely. A 'Yes' outcome would likely require an extraordinary event, such as a sudden breakthrough in Ukraine peace negotiations brokered by Trump. Even in that low-probability scenario, a summit in Moscow would be politically incendiary and is not the only, or even most likely, venue for such a meeting. The combined weight of the short timeline, the absence of any planning signals, the severe political costs, and the existence of a readily available and superior diplomatic alternative leads me to keep my forecast at the extreme low end.",
