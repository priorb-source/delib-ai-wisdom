    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides a sophisticated Poisson model approach and claims to have analyzed multiple recent months showing 'most months do contain at least one such report.' However, this analysis isn't substantiated with actual data - we only have December 2024 as a concrete reference point. The 1.5-2 average appears to be an assumption rather than calculated from evidence. Forecaster 3 raises a CRITICAL point I completely missed: the posting lag issue. The question resolves based on what's visible by July 1, not what was actually reported in June. NUFORC posts in batches with delays, so even if cube reports occur in June, they may not be published in time. This is a major constraint that significantly reduces the effective probability. However, Forecaster 3's characterization of the status quo as 'usually zero' seems overly pessimistic given that December had 6 reports. The disagreement fundamentally comes down to: (1) What's the true monthly base rate for cube reports? (2) How much does posting lag reduce the observed probability?",
    "rationale": "Revising my analysis with the posting lag constraint: Even if I maintain that cube-shaped UFO reports occur with reasonable frequency (based on December's 6 reports), there's a significant probability those June reports won't be posted by July 1. I estimate: (a) Probability that at least one cube is reported in June: ~70% (slightly down from my original thinking, acknowledging December might be above average), (b) Probability those reports are posted by July 1: ~70-75% (NUFORC has delays but isn't extremely slow). Combined probability: 0.70 × 0.72 ≈ 50%. I'm moving down from 75% to 55% primarily due to the posting lag concern, which is a genuine resolution criterion I overlooked. I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 35% because the December data suggests cube reports aren't as vanishingly rare as that forecast implies, and I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 85% because the posting lag risk is real and their base rate assumptions aren't well-evidenced.",
