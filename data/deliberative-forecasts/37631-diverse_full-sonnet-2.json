    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable complementary perspectives. Forecaster 3 offers rigorous quantitative analysis, explicitly calculating the ~40 percentage-point relative swing needed in 45 days and correctly framing this as a tail event even given Tesla's volatility (25-35% typical vs Walmart's 8-10%). Their emphasis on base rates and status quo bias is methodologically sound. Forecaster 2 provides a more risk-focused view, emphasizing the concentration of negative signals around Tesla and the Robotaxi launch as a specific make-or-break catalyst within the timeframe. Both raise valid points I hadn't weighted sufficiently. Forecaster 3's quantitative framing is particularly compelling - requiring a 40-pp relative move between two mega-caps in under 2 months is statistically rare, regardless of individual stock characteristics. However, Forecaster 2 correctly identifies that Tesla's unusual volatility profile and multiple simultaneous risk factors (margin compression, analyst downgrades, overvaluation, high-stakes product launch) create a legitimately elevated tail risk compared to typical large-caps. The wide spread between their forecasts (8% vs 40%) reflects genuine uncertainty about how to weight tail risk against base rates.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward but not as low as Forecaster 3's 8%. Forecaster 3's quantitative analysis convincingly demonstrates this is a tail event requiring extreme relative performance. The base rate argument is strong: mega-cap stocks rarely move 40 percentage points relative to each other in 45 days. However, I maintain that Forecaster 2's risk concentration argument has merit. Tesla faces an unusual confluence of factors: extreme valuation (P/E 163.88), deteriorating fundamentals (5-year low margins), multiple sell ratings, AND a high-stakes catalyst (Robotaxi launch) occurring within the timeframe. This isn't just normal volatility - it's volatility plus specific downside catalysts. The key insight from Forecaster 3 is that even Tesla's high volatility typically produces 25-35% moves over 45 days, while we need something more extreme. But Tesla HAS produced 40%+ moves in short periods before, particularly around major disappointments. The Robotaxi launch creates event risk that could trigger such a move if it disappoints. I'm revising down from 18% to 15% to give more weight to the tail nature of the required outcome while still acknowledging Tesla's unique risk profile exceeds typical large-cap assumptions.",
