    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus. We all agree that the short timeframe of approximately one month and the complete lack of public signals (e.g., FEC filings, staff hires, credible media reports) are the most significant factors favoring a 'No' resolution. Our forecasts are all clustered in the 10-15% range. I found the other analysts' reasoning to be very convincing and complementary to my own. Specifically, Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that I had not fully weighed: the initial Axios article suggesting a run dates back to September 2023, and the lack of any significant follow-up reporting since then suggests the initiative has lost momentum. This 'fading signal' is a compelling piece of evidence against an imminent announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability downward slightly. My initial reasoning remains the same: launching a primary challenge against a powerful incumbent like Lindsey Graham is a major undertaking, and the absence of any preparatory steps this close to the July 1 deadline makes an announcement highly unlikely. The deliberation has reinforced this view. The point raised by Forecaster 3 regarding the staleness of the 2023 news report is particularly salient. Political momentum is often perishable; the fact that the initial speculation from over a year and a half ago did not escalate into more concrete actions or sustained media chatter is strong evidence that a campaign is not on the verge of launching.  The 'status quo is sticky' heuristic applies strongly here. While a surprise announcement is always possible, the wall of negative evidence (no filings, no staff, no leaks, fading media buzz) is high. Therefore, I am decreasing my forecast from 15% to 12% to reflect a slightly stronger conviction in the 'No' outcome based on the arguments presented in the deliberation.",
