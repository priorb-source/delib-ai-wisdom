    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 36 days remain (last eligible date is June 30, 2025; resolution by July 1, 2025), unless a qualifying day occurs sooner.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — over a multi‑week window it’s likely there will be at least one day when neither front page uses the exact word “tariff” or “tariffs.”",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff coverage stays so continuous that at least one of the two papers includes the exact word every single day through June 30. For example, the administration staggers tariff actions and partner responses, and WSJ’s “What’s News” repeatedly uses “tariff(s)” in a daily blurb while NYT also features tariff headlines frequently.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On a slow trade‑news day, attention shifts to other stories (e.g., the Fed, AI/tech, geopolitics, disasters, campaign developments), and both front pages avoid the exact word “tariff(s)”—perhaps covering trade using synonyms like “duties,” “levies,” or “trade barriers,” or not covering it on A1 at all.",
    "rationale": "Framing: The question resolves Yes if there is even a single day in the window when neither the NYT nor WSJ front page contains the exact string “tariff” or “tariffs.” No requires that across every remaining day in May and all of June, at least one of the two front pages contains that word. That’s a high bar for No.\n\nBase expectations: Even during intensive policy cycles, a single topic rarely appears on both A1s every day for weeks. The WSJ often runs broader business summaries on A1, and the NYT rotates among many beats. The exact‑word requirement further lowers the per‑day hit rate: coverage may use “duties,” “levies,” “trade barriers,” or “trade taxes,” which do not count. Weekends and news crowd‑out (Fed decisions, market moves, major geopolitical events, domestic crises, or campaign developments) create natural windows when tariffs drop off A1.\n\nBack‑of‑envelope: Let p be the per‑day probability that both omit “tariff(s).” Even if p is as low as 3–5%, the chance of at least one success over ~36 days is 1 − (1 − p)^36 ≈ 67–83%. With a more plausible p around 8–15% (given topic rotation and wording variability), the aggregated probability rises to roughly 95%+. To stay conservative amid elevated tariff salience this spring, I overweight lower p.\n\nWhy not higher? Tariff policy has been unusually salient, with rolling announcements, market reactions, and international responses that could keep the term on A1, especially in WSJ’s “What’s News.” If WSJ consistently uses the exact word most days, the daily omission probability drops substantially.\n\nWhy not lower? The requirement is “both papers, same day,” but that still needs to hold every day to get No. Given the breadth of A1 coverage and the exact‑word constraint, it’s unlikely that both will include “tariff(s)” literally every single remaining day.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward (toward Yes): Several consecutive days where one paper omits “tariff(s),” evidence of synonym usage instead of “tariff,” or a major non‑trade story dominating A1. Weekend A1s without tariff headlines.\n- Downward (toward No): A continuing sequence where WSJ (and often NYT) explicitly uses “tariff(s)” daily, plus scheduled, staggered tariff actions/retaliations keeping the term alive in A1 blurbs.\n\nResearch assistant input: None beyond the prompt; no additional data provided. Given that, I rely on editorial dynamics, wording probabilities, and aggregation over many days.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
