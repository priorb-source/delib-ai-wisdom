    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that were highly consistent with my own. We all identified the same key factors: the very short timeframe remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, and the complete absence of any public signals (such as media reports, rumors of banker appointments, or company statements) that typically precede an IPO announcement. We all agree that the status quo is the most likely outcome. Forecaster 2 assigned a slightly higher probability (5%) than my initial 2%, weighting the possibility of a surprise announcement via a confidential filing a bit more heavily. Forecaster 3's analysis and 2% probability were nearly identical to my own. No new evidence or fundamentally different arguments were raised by my peers.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast. The deliberation with the other forecasters has reinforced my initial analysis rather than challenged it. The consensus on the core reasoning is strong. The key driver for this forecast remains the extremely short time horizon of just over five weeks. While a surprise announcement is never impossible for a company that may have filed confidentially, it is highly improbable for a company of Rippling's profile to proceed this far without any leaks to major financial news outlets. The arguments presented by the other forecasters align perfectly with this view. I considered Forecaster 2's 5% estimate but concluded that the total lack of any supporting information or even faint rumors justifies staying at the lower end of the low-probability spectrum. Therefore, my confidence in the original 2% forecast has been solidified by this review process.",
