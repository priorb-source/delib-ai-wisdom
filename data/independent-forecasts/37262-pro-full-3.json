  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The continuation of current social and political tensions in India, particularly concerning land rights, religious laws, and agricultural policies, makes the occurrence of large-scale protests a regular feature of public life. The status quo suggests such a protest is likely to occur and be reported.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No protests with 10,000 or more participants occur before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Alternatively, such a protest does occur, but due to reporting lags, media suppression, or editorial discretion, it is not documented by the Global Protest Tracker by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A protest related to ongoing issues such as the Waqf Act, farmers' rights, or another trigger event mobilizes over 10,000 people in India. The event gains sufficient media attention to be documented and listed on the Global Protest Tracker website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on India's recent history of large-scale mobilization and the current volatile political climate. The research report highlights several active flashpoints, including conflicts over religious land laws (Waqf Act) and farmers' rights, which have historically triggered protests far exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold. The specific mention of a planned farmers' march involving 10,000 people is a strong leading indicator that groups are actively organizing at this scale. While the two-month timeframe is relatively short, the multitude of potential triggers increases the likelihood of an event. The primary uncertainty is not whether a protest will occur, but whether it will be specifically reported by the Global Protest Tracker in time. However, a protest of this size is typically newsworthy enough to be captured by the international media sources that such trackers monitor. My probability is not higher because of the short timeline and the specific reporting requirement, which introduces a potential point of failure. A protest could be misreported as smaller, or the tracker might have a significant publication lag. My probability is not lower because the combination of a high-protest-frequency country, multiple active high-profile grievances, and specific intelligence on planned large-scale actions makes the 'Yes' outcome considerably more likely than 'No'. I would raise my forecast if a major national strike were called or a particularly controversial piece of legislation were passed. I would lower it if key protest movements entered into successful negotiations with the government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
