    "review": "Both forecasters strengthen the bearish case with two points I underweighted: (1) the claim that Byron Donalds already has Trump’s endorsement, which would significantly depress Suarez’s near-term incentive to jump; and (2) Florida’s campaign finance reality—he can raise via a political committee without formally announcing—diminishing my end-of-Q2 announcement rationale. Forecaster 3 also adds a May JMI poll putting Suarez at 5% and the Miami election-timing question; both argue for waiting rather than rushing. Their emphasis on the short 26-day window and the lack of pre-launch signals aligns with my view, but they present clearer reasons why the Q2 fundraising deadline is less binding here. I find their reasoning largely convincing, though I treat the Trump endorsement detail as conditional unless confirmed.",
    "rationale": "I initially gave 25% based on the plausibility of a mid-2025 launch and a potential June 30 fundraising optics incentive. Updating: (a) If Donalds indeed has Trump’s endorsement, that’s a strong deterrent to a quick Suarez announcement; (b) Florida’s permissive political committee fundraising weakens the quarter-end urgency; (c) Suarez polling around 5% and the absence of visible ramp-up signals with <4 weeks left reduce the odds of an imminent launch; (d) the Miami election-timing issue arguably encourages patience. A last-minute, low-frills announcement remains possible, but the status quo strongly favors No over a short horizon. I’m moving down modestly to reflect these added headwinds while retaining a nontrivial chance for a late-June move.\nChange: 25% -> 18%.",
