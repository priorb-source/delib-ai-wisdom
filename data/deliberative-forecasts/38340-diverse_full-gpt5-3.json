    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extreme constraints: ongoing civil war, fragmented authority, lack of a functioning legislature, and the very short timeline. They also raise the AU suspension as a potential hurdle. I agree with the core point that, absent visible signs of movement, the default is No. I’m less convinced by the claim that ratification is “impossible” without a legislature; for the purpose of the resolution, what matters is deposit of an instrument with the AU Commission, and depositories typically don’t police internal constitutional compliance. However, the others rightly underline the lack of any signaling or preparatory steps and the coordination/legitimacy challenges that make an executive-only sprint very unlikely within weeks. Their arguments nudge me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "My prior forecast allowed for a narrow path: the SAF-aligned executive could issue a decree and deposit the instrument quickly, even while suspended from AU activities. That path remains theoretically viable and does not strictly depend on prior tariff schedules. But the absence of any public indications (decrees, MFA statements, AU/AfCFTA Secretariat notes) this close to the deadline, combined with active conflict, degraded administrative capacity, and contested legitimacy, makes rapid ratification/deposit highly improbable. The AU suspension could add friction, even if not a hard legal bar. Given peers’ emphasis on the lack of a functioning legislature and no signs of imminent political breakthrough, I’m trimming my estimate. I’m not at near-zero because deposit could still occur unilaterally by the internationally recognized authorities, but without fresh signals, the base rate over the next ~3 weeks is extremely low.",
