    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar reasoning: the site has been deliberately taken down as part of Trump administration policy, has remained offline for months, and faces significant political obstacles to restoration in the remaining 6 weeks. The range of forecasts (20-30%) is remarkably narrow, suggesting strong consensus on the low probability. Forecaster 2 makes a valid point that 6 weeks is 'technically sufficient' for website restoration if prioritized, and emphasizes military institutional independence. Forecaster 3 appears to underestimate the timeline, stating the site had been down 'at least 15 days' as of May 5, when The Guardian article from February 4 suggests it's been down for 3+ months. Both forecasters cite similar upside scenarios: military operational necessity, congressional pressure, or legal challenges. However, neither presents evidence that any of these mechanisms are actually in motion.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find limited grounds to significantly revise my forecast. The core facts remain: (1) The site has been down for over 3 months, not weeks, suggesting a firm policy position; (2) No evidence has emerged of restoration efforts, military pushback, congressional hearings, or legal challenges during this extended period; (3) If military leaders viewed this as operationally critical, we would likely have seen some signal by now; (4) While 6 weeks is technically sufficient for website restoration, it requires political will that has been completely absent for 3+ months. The other forecasters' slightly higher probabilities (25-30%) acknowledge similar factors but may weight the 'technical feasibility if prioritized' argument more heavily. However, the extended period with zero movement toward restoration is a very strong signal about political priorities. I'll update marginally from 20% to 23% to account for: (a) the consensus that some non-trivial probability exists, (b) genuine uncertainty about unpredictable political developments in 6 weeks, and (c) the technical ease of restoration if sudden political will emerged. But the 3+ month status quo without any restoration signals keeps my forecast well below the 25-30% range.",
