    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in a narrow 4-10% range, suggesting strong consensus on the low probability given the extremely short timeframe. The other forecasters raised two compelling points I underweighted: (1) The fact that ChargePoint just completed and reported Q4/FY2025 financial results is itself a positive signal about ongoing normal operations - companies on the verge of bankruptcy typically don't execute routine earnings releases; (2) The precision of the timeframe (57 days) reinforces how constraining this window is. Forecaster 2's point about the absence of typical pre-bankruptcy warning signs (going concern opinions, debt covenant violations, delisting notices) being meaningful in such a short window is well-taken. However, I find Forecaster 2's 4% may be slightly too confident given the genuine uncertainty about the contents of those financial results and the real challenges in the EV charging sector. Forecaster 3's 8% appropriately balances the strong status quo bias with residual tail risk.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update downward but not dramatically. The recent completion of Q4/FY2025 financial reporting is a stronger positive signal than I initially weighted - it indicates the company was functioning well enough to complete audits, prepare reports, and conduct investor communications just weeks ago. This substantially reduces the probability of an imminent bankruptcy filing within the next 57 days. The convergence of all three forecasts between 4-10% validates that the base rate logic and short timeframe dominate this question. However, I maintain some distance from the most conservative 4% estimate because: (1) we lack visibility into the actual financial results details, (2) the EV charging sector faces documented headwinds, and (3) even in short timeframes, tail risks exist. My updated forecast of 7% reflects appropriate downward revision while preserving reasonable uncertainty about unobserved financial distress indicators.",
