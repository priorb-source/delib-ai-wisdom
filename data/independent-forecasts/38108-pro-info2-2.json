  "information": "Elon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly expressed confidence that savings will continue to grow, with Musk suggesting a long-term goal of $1 trillion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The project is undergoing a transition to the OMB, which is likely to slow the rate of newly claimed savings. While the total will grow from the last reported figure of 'over $100 billion,' it is unlikely to double in the remaining timeframe under normal circumstances.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The project's integration into the OMB introduces bureaucratic hurdles and a more conservative methodology for calculating savings. No major 'big ticket' savings are finalized and claimed before the July 1 deadline, resulting in the total savings figure being somewhere between $150 billion and $190 billion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by strong political motivation, the new OMB leadership under Russell Vought prioritizes and fast-tracks the validation of several large-scale savings initiatives. The renegotiation of a major government contract or the elimination of a massive fraudulent program allows for a sudden, large increase in the claimed total, pushing it over the $200 billion mark just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 40%. The primary factor against this outcome is the short timeframe of approximately one month, combined with a significant organizational transition. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative is being integrated into the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Such transitions often introduce bureaucratic friction that could slow the rate at which new savings are claimed. Doubling the last known estimate of 'over $100 billion' (from February 2025) in just four months is an ambitious goal, especially during a handover. However, the probability is not lower due to immense political will from the administration and the project's backers to announce a major success. The new director, Russell Vought, is known for aggressive cost-cutting, and the term 'claimed savings' can be flexible. A few large-scale findings could be fast-tracked to meet the goal. The forecast is not higher because the operational drag from the transition represents a significant, tangible hurdle, making this outcome less likely than not. I would increase my forecast upon news of specific, high-value savings being finalized, and decrease it upon reports of delays or methodological disputes within the OMB.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nElon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
