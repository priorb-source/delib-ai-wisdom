    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: consistent cross-pollster leads for Cuomo in the high-30s/low-40s, a sizable first-choice gap, and an RCV path reinforced by the Marist simulation. They also correctly flag the main downside risks: RCV volatility if anti-Cuomo transfers concentrate, progressive enthusiasm/turnout, and late-breaking negatives. I didn’t see materially new evidence, but I found their emphasis on the Marist RCV simulation as a key check on transfer risk compelling. Their framing of Cuomo as the likely focal point for moderate transfers in a fragmented field is persuasive and consistent with NYC primary dynamics. No glaring logical gaps in their analyses.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: Cuomo remains the clear frontrunner ~15 days out, with multiple independent polls (Marist, Emerson/PIX11/The Hill, SurveyUSA, HSG, DfP) putting him near 40% and Mamdani in the high-teens/low-20s. That magnitude of lead typically holds absent a shock, especially with name recognition, cohesive bloc endorsements (Orthodox communities), targeted Hispanic outreach, and outside spending. RCV considerations: The Marist simulation showing Cuomo clearing 50% in round 5 specifically mitigates the principal risk that he is a weak second-choice recipient; given a fragmented field, transfers from other moderates likely boost him. Risks: Some evidence of narrowing and progressive momentum (AOC endorsement) could tighten the race; NYC primary polling/turnout composition can be tricky; Cuomo’s negatives could cap his ceiling or spur late opposition. However, I have not seen late, high-quality polling putting this within single digits or suggesting Mamdani wins the final RCV round, nor signs of major establishment/union consolidation against Cuomo. Update: I’m nudging my estimate up modestly to reflect slightly more weight on the Marist RCV modeling and the lack of contrary late data since my prior. I’m not higher because RCV/turnout volatility and Cuomo’s polarization keep tail risks live.",
