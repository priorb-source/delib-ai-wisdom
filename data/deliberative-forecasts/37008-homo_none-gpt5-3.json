    "review": "- Forecaster 2 emphasizes the active-step requirement to extend and the lack of public signals so far; that aligns with my baseline and is a solid reason to keep probability below 50%.\n- Forecaster 3’s main new angle is that infrastructure fixes typically exceed four weeks, implying a higher extension likelihood. That’s plausible, but it’s speculative without current reporting on continued outages or repair timelines, and emergency powers may not be strictly necessary once procurement and operational measures are underway.\n- Net: F2’s argumentation is more grounded in procedural baselines and current signal paucity; F3’s case raises a valid mechanism for extension but lacks corroborating evidence at this time.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is No on Apr 30 unless there’s an extension or a new emergency. With nine days left and no credible indications yet of an impending extension or ongoing severe load shedding, the base case favors expiry on Apr 29. Extensions are certainly possible—Samoa has used rolling SoEs before—and last-minute renewals do happen, so a material tail remains. I roughly decompose as: ~30–35% chance the energy SoE is extended into May, plus ~5% for an unrelated/new SoE (e.g., weather), yielding about 35–40% combined. Forecaster 3’s point that energy stabilization often takes longer than a month nudges the extension probability up somewhat, but absent fresh signals I still see the active-step hurdle and political cost arguments (per F2) as keeping this below even odds. No change from my prior is warranted on available information.",
