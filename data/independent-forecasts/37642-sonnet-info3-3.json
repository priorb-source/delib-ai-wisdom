  "information": "Recent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks until July 1, 2025. The key event is the June FOMC meeting, likely scheduled for mid-June, which is the only scheduled meeting within the resolution window.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve has recently paused rate cuts and is maintaining current interest rates in a wait-and-see posture.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed holds rates steady at its June 2025 meeting, citing mixed economic signals: while CPI has decelerated, the strong April jobs report with unemployment at 4.2% suggests the labor market remains resilient. The FOMC decides to wait for more data before resuming rate cuts, particularly wanting to see sustained progress on inflation and clearer signs of labor market softening.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic data deteriorates significantly in May, with inflation falling faster than expected and unemployment rising notably. Financial market stress or clear signs of economic slowdown prompt the Fed to announce a rate cut at the June FOMC meeting to provide preemptive support to the economy.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors no rate cut. The Fed has already paused its cutting cycle, and market expectations via CME FedWatch indicate participants view September or later as more probable for resuming cuts. The April jobs report showing strong employment growth and 4.2% unemployment provides little urgency for near-term easing. While CPI deceleration is encouraging, one data point typically doesn't drive Fed action. The Fed operates with deliberate caution and requires sustained trends. With only one FOMC meeting likely before July 1 (mid-June), there's limited opportunity for the Fed to reverse course. My forecast is not higher because: (1) market pricing strongly suggests September timeline, (2) the Fed just paused cuts indicating satisfaction with current stance, (3) labor markets remain strong, and (4) the Fed rarely makes abrupt policy reversals within 6-7 weeks without major economic shocks. My forecast is not lower because: (1) some probability exists for unexpected economic deterioration, (2) inflation could fall faster than anticipated, (3) financial markets could experience stress requiring Fed response, and (4) forecasting certainty 6-7 weeks out is imprudent. I would update higher if: May economic data shows significant weakening, Fed officials signal openness to June cuts, or financial conditions tighten materially. I would update lower if: Fed officials explicitly rule out near-term cuts, inflation data disappoints, or employment remains robust.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
