    "review": "My initial forecast was 15%. Forecaster 2 (30%) seems to overweigh general possibilities, such as the historical announcement window, against the strong specific evidence of no campaign preparations for Suarez. Their argument about a local Miami vote potentially delaying Suarez's decision actually works against their higher forecast. Forecaster 3 (12%) provides a highly convincing and balanced analysis. They introduced two key points I had not fully weighed: (1) the challenging nature of the GOP primary, with a Trump-endorsed candidate already running, makes a rushed entry by Suarez strategically unwise, and (2) Suarez's history of quick campaign launches (e.g., his presidential bid) provides a specific reason why a last-minute announcement is more plausible for him than for a typical politician. Forecaster 3's reasoning is the most persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly lowering my forecast from 15% to 13%. The deliberation process, particularly the analysis from Forecaster 3, was very helpful. I am now placing more weight on the strategic dynamics of the Florida GOP primary. The presence of a Trump-endorsed candidate (Byron Donalds) and other potential heavyweights creates a strong incentive for Suarez to be cautious and wait rather than launching a campaign hastily before the July 1 deadline. This new consideration makes a near-term announcement less likely. I am not lowering my forecast more significantly because Forecaster 3's other point—that Suarez has a history of launching campaigns on short notice—is a valid counterargument that keeps a surprise 'Yes' outcome firmly in the realm of possibility. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the extremely short timeline and the complete lack of any public-facing campaign preparations are the strongest signals pointing to 'No'. The added strategic context simply reinforces this conclusion.",
