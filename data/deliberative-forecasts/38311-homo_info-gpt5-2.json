    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, consistent signals. Forecaster 2 cites inclusion on official participant lists dated June 3 and emphasizes the short, low-friction travel to Canada—both are incremental positives I hadn’t explicitly weighed. Forecaster 3 notes possible communiqué friction (per Nikkei) but correctly argues that affects outcomes, not attendance; they also reference ongoing pre-summit bilats (e.g., Scholz), which are consistent with normal leader engagement and thus supportive of attendance. Their tail-risk sets (health, crisis, security, postponement/weather) match mine. I find their reasoning sound and slightly additive, especially the official participant list and concrete date window (June 15–17).",
    "rationale": "The status quo remains strongly pro-attendance: (1) White House confirmation that Trump will visit Canada for the G7, (2) host-country security/airspace measures already in place (June 10–18), and (3) preparatory G7 meetings nearby with senior U.S. officials—all indicating the summit is on track and the U.S. is fully engaged. New to me from the deliberation is his inclusion on official participant lists as of June 3 and the firm dates (June 15–17), which tighten the timeline and reduce uncertainty. The base rate of U.S. presidential attendance at in-person G7/G8 is extremely high, and Canada is an easy, short flight for Air Force One. Remaining downside tails are health issues, a major domestic/international crisis, a credible security threat, or extreme weather/airspace disruptions; deliberate nonattendance remains unlikely given salience and precedent (even in contentious years, e.g., 2018, he still attended albeit briefly). I’m nudging up from 92% to 94% on the added evidence of official lists and the short window to wheels-up. I would move higher on publication of the detailed WH schedule and pool reports of departure/arrival; lower on any credible reports of postponement, health/security issues, or an acute crisis requiring him to remain in Washington.",
