  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The meeting is in June 2025, and the results are typically published at its conclusion.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The FATF list of 'Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring' remains unchanged from its February 2025 state.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF Plenary concludes without making any additions or removals. This could happen if the assessment of candidate countries, like Mozambique's post-visit review or the evaluation of the British Virgin Islands, is deferred to the next plenary for procedural or political reasons.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF Plenary announces a change to the list. For example, Mozambique is removed from the list after a successful on-site visit, and/or the British Virgin Islands is added due to identified strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering framework.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by a very strong historical base rate and specific, compelling evidence for changes at the upcoming plenary. \n\nFirstly, historical data shows that changes to the grey list are the norm. Of the 17 plenary meetings since the current monitoring process began in 2018, 16 have resulted in additions or removals. The sole exception was the October 2020 plenary, which was an unusual virtual meeting altered by the COVID-19 pandemic. This establishes a base probability of change at over 90%.\n\nSecondly, there are multiple, credible pathways to a 'Yes' outcome in June 2025. Mozambique appears to be a strong candidate for removal, having reportedly completed its technical reforms and undergone a successful on-site visit in April 2025, which is the final prerequisite for delisting. Simultaneously, the British Virgin Islands is a strong candidate for addition, as its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025 after a follow-up found 'major gaps,' and the UK has indicated it will not block a listing. The question only requires one of these events (or any other change) to occur. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% to account for the small chance of unforeseen circumstances. The Plenary could decide to postpone decisions due to last-minute political complexities or if the final report on Mozambique's on-site visit reveals issues not mentioned in preliminary feedback. \n\nMy probability is not lower because both the historical precedent and the specific evidence for at least one change are overwhelming. For a 'No' outcome, not only would the strong cases for Mozambique's removal and BVI's addition have to simultaneously fail, but no other jurisdictions would be ready for a change in status either. This combination of events is highly unlikely. \n\nI would lower my forecast if credible reports emerged that Mozambique's on-site visit had failed or that a political compromise was reached to delay the BVI's listing. I would raise it further if a high-level source pre-emptively confirmed an upcoming change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
