    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the other elite teams (e.g., Yankees, Phillies, Orioles, Braves) edges the Dodgers in winning percentage by June 15, or the Dodgers stumble for a week while a rival goes on a short hot streak.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers maintain their current strong form, put together another solid 10–14 game stretch heading into mid‑June, and rivals regress or split tougher series, leaving the Dodgers alone (or tied) for the top MLB winning percentage when Metaculus checks the official standings.",
    "rationale": "Timing is short and variance is high: over ~4 weeks, a handful of games can swing the top spot. The Dodgers are a perennial top‑tier team with elite run differential potential and depth, and current reporting indicates they’re winning consistently despite injuries, which supports a materially above‑baseline chance. However, even for a powerhouse, the probability of being the single highest winning percentage team on a specific date is usually below 50% because several other strong teams are in contention and the margin at the top is typically tight. I place extra weight on the status quo (multiple teams clustered near the top), implying that “No” remains more likely than “Yes.” My forecast isn’t higher because small sample volatility and strong competition make it hard for any one team to be clearly first on that exact check; it isn’t lower because the Dodgers’ talent, depth, and recent form make them one of the most plausible teams to hold or share the top spot (a tie should still count as having the highest). I would update upward if: the Dodgers are currently first or within a game of first in MLB winning percentage; their upcoming 3‑series slate is soft; or key rivals suffer injuries/underperform. I would update downward if: they’re 2–3+ games behind the MLB leader by late May/early June; key Dodgers (e.g., Betts/Freeman/Ohtani or top starters) miss time; or a rival (e.g., Yankees/Phillies/Orioles) opens a multi‑game cushion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
