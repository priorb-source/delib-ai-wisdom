    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was too optimistic. I overestimated the power of the bill's executive sponsorship to overcome the significant procedural hurdles within a very short timeframe. The other forecasters made two particularly compelling points that I had not sufficiently weighted. First, Forecaster 3's mention of the likely Sallah recess in June is a crucial piece of context, as it materially shortens an already compressed legislative calendar. Second, both forecasters rightly emphasized that because this is a broad 'Tax Reforms Bill,' the popular real estate VAT exemption could easily be delayed by debates over other, more contentious provisions within the same package. Their general argument to heavily weight the 'status quo' of legislative inertia is prudent given the lack of specific information on the bill's current stage. Their reasoning, grounded in the mechanics of the legislative process and calendar, is more convincing than my initial focus on political will alone.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast downwards from 65% to 45%. The core arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that the procedural and timeline risks are much greater than I initially assessed. The combination of a bicameral legislative process, committee stages, potential for harmonization debates, and presidential assent makes the sub-two-month timeline extremely challenging. The impending Sallah recess, as noted by Forecaster 3, further constricts the available time and is a key factor in my revision. I also now place more weight on the risk that other elements within the larger Tax Reforms Bill could cause delays, holding up the entire package. However, I am not lowering my forecast to the 37-40% range of the other forecasters. I maintain that a bill sponsored by the Federal Government and framed as a measure to 'boost housing affordability' carries significant political weight. This executive priority gives it a much higher chance of being fast-tracked than a typical bill. My updated forecast of 45% reflects a near-even balance between the strong positive signal of executive sponsorship and the very strong negative signals of a compressed timeline and procedural complexity. It acknowledges that failure is now slightly more likely than success.",
