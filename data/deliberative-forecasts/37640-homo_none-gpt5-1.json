    "review": "Both forecasters make solid, status-quo–leaning arguments: short horizon, federal inertia, records/archival obligations, and the key point that any reachable response (including redirects or a sunset page) likely counts as “up” for the resolver. They also correctly flag the two main risks: a deliberate pre–July 1 takedown and transient/measurement risk at the time Metaculus checks. The only potentially new angle raised was a question about whether redirects might be flagged as down. I’m not persuaded by that concern; in practice, IsItDownRightNow generally treats any successful HTTP connection (including 3xx/4xx) as up, with “down” usually tied to DNS/connection failures or persistent 5xx. I don’t see additional evidence that would raise the chance of a hard domain decommission before July 1. Their reasoning largely aligns with mine, and I don’t find a compelling reason to shift materially based on their inputs.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~7 weeks). The domain is currently up. Federal web decommissioning typically involves planning, records coordination, and communications, making a full shutdown before July 1 less likely than leaving a static notice or redirect—which would still resolve as online for the resolution source. The resolution mechanic also gives some protection against brief outages because Metaculus can check any time on/after July 1. Residual risks remain: a symbolic rapid takedown, an unexpected DNS/hosting misstep, or unlucky transient downtime at the check time. Weighing these, I maintain a high probability with a small discount for those risks and the current political intent to eliminate the program, but no new evidence justifies changing my already-high estimate.",
