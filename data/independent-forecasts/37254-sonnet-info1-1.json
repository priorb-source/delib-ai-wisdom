  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine but does not invade any other country",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia remains militarily focused exclusively on Ukraine through July 1, 2025. Despite tensions with neighboring countries like Moldova or Georgia, no ground forces are sent into other sovereign territories. The status quo of the current conflict continues without geographic expansion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia sends ground military forces into another country such as Moldova (possibly to connect with Transnistria), Georgia (expanding beyond existing occupied territories), or another former Soviet state. The invasion occurs without that government's consent, and the US publicly and formally accuses Russia of invasion through official government channels.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome, and good forecasting practice suggests placing significant weight on continuity, especially over short timeframes. Several factors support a low probability: (1) The 2-month window is very short for a major military operation to be planned, executed, and publicly condemned. (2) Russia's military is heavily committed in Ukraine, making it extremely difficult to open a second major front. (3) There are no credible reports of Russian military buildups on borders with other countries. (4) The base rate for major interstate invasions is low, even for aggressive actors. (5) Invading another country would trigger even stronger international isolation and potential military responses, especially if targeting NATO members. The research assistant's report contains some questionable claims (particularly about US voting patterns that seem inconsistent with established US policy), which reduces confidence in that source. However, it does confirm the US continues to reference Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Potential targets like Moldova or Georgia exist but show no imminent signs of invasion. The probability is not zero because Russia has demonstrated willingness to use military force unpredictably, and regional instability could theoretically create sudden opportunities. The probability is not higher because there are simply no current indicators of preparations for invading other countries, and the timeframe is too short for such a major development. I would update higher if intelligence reports emerged of military buildups near other borders or diplomatic crises escalated dramatically. I would update lower as each week passes without incident.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
