    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling arguments that align closely with my initial analysis. They particularly emphasize the IRS operational challenges (three acting directors in one week, workforce reductions) which makes executing complex unprecedented actions even more difficult than I initially weighted. Their point about Harvard's lawsuit potentially triggering court injunctions that could extend beyond July 1 is well-taken. However, all three of us have essentially converged on the same core reasoning: the 67-day timeframe is the overwhelming constraint, procedural safeguards are robust, and no major university has lost tax-exempt status in recent history. The 3-4% range they propose is reasonable, though I think it's slightly underweighting the evidence that the IRS is actively 'making plans' and the possibility of unprecedented executive action in unprecedented political circumstances.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their emphasis on the IRS operational chaos particularly compelling - with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions, the agency's capacity to execute a complex, unprecedented revocation in 67 days is even more limited than I initially assessed. Their point about Harvard's lawsuit potentially triggering preliminary injunctions is also important. However, I don't think I should go as low as 3-4% because: (1) multiple news outlets report the IRS is actively 'making plans' for revocation, suggesting some real movement beyond political rhetoric, (2) the Trump administration has demonstrated willingness to push legal boundaries, and (3) while procedural norms strongly favor the status quo, there's a non-zero probability of an attempted emergency administrative action, even if legally dubious and ultimately reversed. The combination of reported IRS planning activity and unprecedented political pressure warrants staying slightly above the 3-4% range, but the overwhelming timeline constraint justifies moving down from my initial 6%.",
