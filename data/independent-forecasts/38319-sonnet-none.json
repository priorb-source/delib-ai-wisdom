    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days until the official announcement expected around June 21, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Industrial production month-over-month changes are highly volatile and tend to fluctuate between positive and negative. The base rate for a positive month-over-month change in regional industrial production is typically close to 50% over time, with considerable variation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 shows a decline or no growth in Tohoku's industrial production. This could occur due to mean reversion after March's strong 7.6% gain, seasonal factors, temporary production adjustments, supply chain disruptions, or reduced demand from key industries in the region.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 continues the positive momentum from March with another month-over-month increase. This would indicate sustained recovery in the region, with factors such as continued strong demand, improved business conditions, or seasonal strength supporting two consecutive months of growth.",
    "rationale": "The key facts are that March 2025 showed a strong 7.6% month-over-month increase after two consecutive months of decline (January and February). This pattern suggests high volatility in Tohoku's industrial production. Without additional intelligence from the research assistant about April-specific conditions, I must rely heavily on base rates and pattern analysis. Industrial production typically shows roughly 50-50 odds of positive versus negative month-over-month changes over time. However, several factors influence my assessment: First, March's robust 7.6% gain was notably strong, which could indicate either building momentum or a potential correction in April as production normalizes. Large positive movements in industrial production are often followed by more modest changes or reversals due to mean reversion. Second, the fact that March was the first increase in three months suggests the region had been experiencing weakness, making sustained growth less certain. Third, I have no information about forward-looking indicators, order books, or specific industry conditions in Tohoku for April. My forecast is slightly below 50% (at 48%) because I give modest weight to the possibility of mean reversion after March's strong performance. I'm not more bearish because the March increase does suggest improving conditions that could carry into April. I'm not more bullish because very strong month-over-month gains like 7.6% often represent catch-up production or temporary surges that don't immediately repeat. To update higher, I would need evidence of sustained demand, strong forward indicators, or broader Japanese industrial strength in April. To update lower, I would need evidence of disruptions, weakening demand, or broader economic softness in the region during April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
