  "information": "Changes to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, if no changes are made to the USDA's webpage, the term 'snack foods' will still be listed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, acting on its stated policy goals, directs the USDA to make a swift, cosmetic change to the webpage, removing the term 'snack foods' as a signal of its intent to reform SNAP, even before a formal regulatory change is finalized.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic and procedural inertia prevail. The lengthy and complex processes required for either a formal USDA rule change or a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act are not completed by the resolution date, leaving the webpage's content, including the term 'snack foods', unchanged.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo due to the significant procedural and temporal barriers to changing national SNAP eligibility rules. As my research assistant noted, such a change requires either a congressional amendment or a formal USDA rulemaking process. Both are notoriously slow. A new law from Congress is out of the question in this timeframe. The formal rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, involves drafting, a public comment period (typically 30-60 days), and finalization, a sequence that almost always takes many months, if not years. Given we are less than two months from the resolution date of July 1, 2025, it is institutionally infeasible for a formal policy change to be enacted.\n\nThe primary argument for a 'No' outcome rests on the possibility of a new administration ordering the USDA to change the website's text without an underlying rule change. This would be an informal action to signal a new policy direction, as suggested by the NY Post article. While possible, I assess this as unlikely in the given timeframe. Such a public-facing change on a major benefits program would typically be part of a carefully planned policy rollout, not a hasty, standalone update. Given a new administration has only been in place for a few months, their focus would likely be on initiating the formal, long-term processes rather than on minor website edits that could create confusion for recipients and retailers.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 95% because there is a non-trivial chance that a politically motivated administration may prioritize the symbolic act of changing the website's language, viewing it as a quick 'win' and a signal to their base, despite the lack of a formal rule change. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the default for government is inaction and maintaining the status quo. The institutional barriers to change are immense and the historical precedent, as noted by my assistant, shows the USDA has actively resisted such restrictions in the past due to implementation difficulties. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence of an expedited or emergency rulemaking process being initiated by the USDA or a leaked internal directive ordering the website to be changed immediately.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process.

According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
