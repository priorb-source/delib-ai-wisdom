    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning and reach nearly identical forecasts (65-68%), which suggests reasonable calibration. The key insight from Forecaster 3 that I hadn't fully articulated is the specific population breakdown: LA metro (~13M), Bay Area (~7-8M), and San Diego (~3M) together represent approximately 23-24 million people. This is important because if drought is 'already bad' and affecting major population centers, hitting the 20M threshold becomes quite plausible - you don't need universal coverage, just enough of these metro areas affected. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that late June represents peak dry season when conditions typically persist or worsen, not improve. The conditional adjustments they propose (higher if near 20M now, lower if well below 15M) are reasonable bookends. However, all three analyses acknowledge the same critical limitation: we lack current specific drought data, making it impossible to know if we're starting from 10M, 15M, 18M, or already above 20M affected residents.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find the population concentration argument particularly compelling. California's three largest metro areas contain about 23-24 million residents combined. For the question to resolve Yes, we need 20 million in drought - that's about 51% of the state's population. Given the article states drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad,' it's reasonable to infer this affects at least some major population centers. With only 30 days until resolution and California entering its driest period (late June), significant improvement is highly unlikely. The convergence of all three forecasts around 65-68% suggests this range captures the appropriate uncertainty. My original 68% was already at the upper end, reflecting optimism that current conditions are substantial. The population breakdown from Forecaster 3 reinforces this - but doesn't provide actual current data. I'll adjust marginally upward to 70% to reflect slightly higher confidence that the combination of (1) 'already bad' current conditions, (2) population concentration in major metros, and (3) persistence through peak dry season makes exceeding 20M more likely than not. However, I won't move dramatically higher because the absence of specific current figures from the Drought Monitor remains a significant uncertainty.",
