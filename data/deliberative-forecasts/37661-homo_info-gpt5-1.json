    "review": "Forecaster 2 reasonably emphasizes that the core regulatory hurdle appears cleared and that Starlink can flip countries quickly once logistics align. I agree that U.S. political noise is unlikely to be a local blocker. However, their note implying “Waitlist” might count is inconsistent with the resolution criteria here (we need “Available”). Forecaster 3 adds an important, underweighted point: tariff/pricing approval and commercial enablement can be gating in South Asia and often take longer than 4–6 weeks. They also correctly note Starlink typically marks “Available” only when it can fulfill orders, not merely upon licensing. I find F3’s caution on tariff approval, lawful intercept/compliance, payments/FX, and customs practicalities persuasive and a meaningful downside risk within the short window, though their 35% seems too low given public targets, a completed trial, import permission, and political top-cover.",
    "rationale": "New considerations from the others—especially the likelihood that BTRC tariff approval and commercial enablement (billing, taxes, FX, import logistics) are still pending—make the final website flip less of a lock within ~6 weeks. While the issuance of two 10‑year licenses and a government‑backed timeline for May/June materially raise the base rate for a fast go‑live, Starlink’s practice of toggling to “Available” only when orders and shipping are truly open means these administrative steps can be determinative. I’m also adjusting for the possibility that initial status could be “Waitlist” in parts of the country, which would not resolve Yes. Balancing those frictions against strong political will, a completed trial, and Starlink’s ability to operate without a local gateway via ISLs, I’m reducing my estimate. Change: down from 78% to 68%. I’d move up on evidence of tariff approval/pricing posted, terminals clearing customs, or Starlink enabling Bangladesh addresses on the order flow; I’d move down on reports of delayed tariff approval, added compliance requirements (e.g., LI), or slippage into July.",
