    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The civil unrest related to the cost of living subsides or is contained by Mozambican authorities without escalating to extreme violence. The long-running insurgency in the Cabo Delgado province remains geographically limited and does not threaten major population centers outside the region. Consequently, the US State Department does not see a need to raise the travel advisory to its highest level, and it remains at Level 2 or is upgraded to Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current protests escalate dramatically, leading to widespread and violent clashes with security forces in multiple cities, including the capital, Maputo. Alternatively, the insurgency in Cabo Delgado could achieve a significant tactical victory, spreading its operations southward and creating a perception of a collapsing security environment across the country. Either event would signal a severe and imminent danger to U.S. citizens, prompting the State Department to issue a Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the high threshold for a Level 4 advisory and the short timeframe. The current advisory for Mozambique is 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,' with a higher warning for the Cabo Delgado province specifically. A shift to a country-wide Level 4 ('Do Not Travel') represents the most severe warning and is typically reserved for situations like full-scale armed conflict, a complete breakdown of civil order, or other situations where the state cannot guarantee the safety of foreign nationals. While the recent protests mentioned in the ATTA advisory are a significant concern and indicate rising instability, they do not, by themselves, typically trigger a Level 4 warning unless they devolve into widespread, uncontrollable violence. The world changes slowly, and a jump of two advisory levels in two months is a rare event. The insurgency in Cabo Delgado has been a risk factor for years without necessitating a country-wide Level 4. The status quo, where the government contains these threats to a manageable level (from the State Department's perspective), is the most likely outcome. My probability is not lower than 10% because the combination of pre-existing insurgency and new civil unrest creates a volatile environment where a rapid deterioration is plausible, even if unlikely. A severe government crackdown on protests or a major insurgent attack outside of Cabo Delgado could be a catalyst. My probability is not higher than 10% because the bar for Level 4 is extremely high, and state security apparatuses are often resilient enough to prevent the worst-case scenarios from materializing over a short period. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of the insurgency spreading south or if the protests led to multiple fatalities and a state of emergency being declared in major cities. I would decrease it if the protests dissipate and the situation in the north remains stable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
