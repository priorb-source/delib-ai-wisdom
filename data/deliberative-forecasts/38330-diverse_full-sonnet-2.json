    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in the 7-15% range, reflecting consensus on low probability. Forecaster 2 makes the strongest case for a slightly higher estimate by emphasizing the Russian asset story as a distinct trigger involving official government terminology that might be quoted directly. This is a valuable point I underweighted - official government decrees are more likely to be quoted verbatim than informal consumer trends. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my own, emphasizing NYT's stylistic preferences against specific jargon. The clarification that 'reverse repurchase agreements' and similar financial terms don't count under the resolution criteria is helpful. Both forecasters correctly identify that having two potential news hooks (Chinese tourism and Russian assets) increases the probability somewhat, though all agree the short 22-day window and NYT's tendency to use alternative phrasing remain the dominant factors keeping this low.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on the Russian asset mechanism as a potential trigger for direct quotation somewhat compelling. Official government terminology from decoded policy documents is more likely to appear verbatim in reporting than informal consumer trends. However, my core reasoning remains sound: (1) The 22-day window is extremely constraining; (2) NYT has strong stylistic preferences against adopting specific foreign economic jargon; (3) The Chinese tourism trend has existed for over a month without NYT coverage, suggesting it hasn't crossed their newsworthiness threshold; (4) Even when covering these stories, journalists typically paraphrase ('asset buybacks,' 'shopping tourism') rather than adopt precise terminology. The Russian story adds a meaningful secondary pathway, but doesn't fundamentally change the calculus. I'm updating slightly upward from 8% to 10% to acknowledge the Russian mechanism as an additional potential trigger that could involve direct quotation, while maintaining that the overwhelming likelihood is that NYT either won't cover these stories in the narrow window, or will use alternative phrasing if they do.",
