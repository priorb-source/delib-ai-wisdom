    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core constraints: only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party; no filing has occurred; timelines for party bans are measured in years, not weeks. They add two useful points: (1) the BfV’s extremist classification does not translate into a ban and doesn’t accelerate the Court’s process; (2) AfD’s high polling raises political risk for initiators, making a near-term filing even less likely. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with precedent (NPD 2017) and procedural realities. Nothing presented increases the plausibility of a pre–July 1 ban; if anything, the political context slightly lowers it. The mention of an expedited track remains a theoretical tail with no precedent for a full ban this fast.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~60 days. Party-ban proceedings in Germany have historically taken years (e.g., NPD filing-to-decision ~3–4 years) and the Court is deliberately cautious.\n- Process hurdles: As of May 2, 2025, there is no formal application by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government. A cross-party motion from 124 MPs lacks majority support and does not initiate proceedings. Without a filing, a Court decision is impossible; with a filing, a ban before July 1 would still be unprecedented.\n- Precedent and alternatives: The Federal Constitutional Court has banned only two parties in the 1950s and declined to ban the NPD in 2017, later enabling funding exclusion instead. This signals extreme reluctance to ban and preference for narrower tools.\n- Political context: Strong AfD polling increases the political risk of a failed or rushed ban attempt, further reducing the odds of a rapid filing.\n- Tail risks: I allow a minimal probability for an extraordinary, unforeseen security crisis prompting both a filing and an unprecedentedly expedited ruling. Even then, the chance that the Court would announce an outright ban by July 1 is vanishingly small.\nGiven these factors and the additional context provided by the other forecasters, I see no reason to raise my estimate; if anything, the political points would nudge it down. I’ll hold essentially steady to avoid false precision and overconfidence at the low end.",
