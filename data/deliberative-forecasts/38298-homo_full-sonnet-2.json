    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that deserve careful consideration. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly important point I underweighted: **April 2025 ranking only second warmest (not first) suggests the exceptional warmth earlier in the year may be moderating**. This breaks the pattern from January (1st) and March (1st/tied) and indicates May might not reach the extreme threshold needed to break the 2020 record. Forecaster 3's emphasis on status quo bias is also important—records are inherently rare events, and even in warming years, most months don't break all-time records. Forecaster 2's analysis is similar to mine but slightly more optimistic at 45%. Both forecasters correctly identify the key tension: exceptional early-year warmth and regional May heat events versus the high bar (+0.95°C), neutral ENSO conditions, and mixed regional signals. The April moderation signal is the most significant new evidence that warrants updating my forecast downward.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 3's April moderation argument particularly compelling and believe I should adjust downward from my initial 38%. The sequence of January (1st), March (1st/tied), April (2nd only) suggests a cooling trend from the year's peak, which makes May breaking the exceptional 2020 record less likely. Combined with the status quo bias principle—that records are rare even in warming climates—I may have overweighted the early-year momentum. However, I don't want to go as low as 32% because: (1) 3 of 4 months ranking in the top 2 positions is still extraordinary and indicates persistent exceptional warmth; (2) Multiple May 2025 regional heat records were documented across Europe and North America; (3) The long-term warming trend provides a strong baseline. The neutral ENSO state remains a significant constraint, as both 2020 and 2016 record Mays benefited from El Niño conditions. Balancing the April moderation signal and status quo bias against the still-exceptional early-year performance and documented May heat events, I'm updating to 35%—acknowledging the moderation pattern while still recognizing meaningful probability above the base rate.",
