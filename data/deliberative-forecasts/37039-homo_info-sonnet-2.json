    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I completely missed: they claim the 31% tariff is already listed in the HTS under subheading 9903.01.60 but suspended through July 9, 2025. If true, this fundamentally changes the analysis because the resolution criteria explicitly state 'Whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.' This means the current status quo already satisfies the Yes resolution criteria. Forecaster 2's confirmation that the tariff took effect April 9 (rather than just being announced) also strengthens the case that it's already formally implemented in the HTS. The strategic logic of suspension vs. removal is compelling - suspensions preserve negotiating leverage while removals eliminate it, making complete removal before June 1 less likely than I initially assessed. However, I note that Forecaster 3's information about the current suspended status comes from their research assistant, which I cannot independently verify from my own materials. This creates some uncertainty about whether the tariff is currently listed as they describe.",
    "rationale": "My initial 70% forecast significantly underweighted the importance of the resolution criteria's explicit statement about suspended provisions. If the tariff is indeed already listed in the HTS (even if suspended), then a No outcome requires affirmative policy action - either complete removal or rate modification - within just 38 days. This is a much higher bar than I initially considered. The strategic logic strongly favors maintaining the listing during negotiations: it preserves leverage without imposing economic costs during the suspension period. Complete removal would signal weakness and eliminate negotiating power, making it an unlikely choice for an administration using tariffs strategically. The Trump administration's historical pattern of suspending rather than removing tariffs during negotiations supports this analysis. However, I'm maintaining some uncertainty because: (1) I cannot independently verify the current HTS status that Forecaster 3 describes, (2) 38 days still allows time for unexpected policy shifts, especially in an administration known for rapid policy changes, and (3) Switzerland's significant economic leverage (0% US tariffs, 500,000 US jobs) could potentially motivate exceptional policy treatment. The upward revision from 70% to 83% reflects higher confidence that the status quo satisfies resolution criteria while preserving meaningful uncertainty about potential policy changes.",
