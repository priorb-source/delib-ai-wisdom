    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points I should have weighted more heavily. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Graham's endorsement coalition - particularly Trump's backing in a GOP primary - is crucial context that makes a challenge far less viable. Forecaster 3's observation about South Carolina's spring 2026 filing deadline is excellent; if official filing isn't required until next year, there's minimal urgency for Norman to announce by July 1, 2025. The June 30 fundraising deadline argument has merit but seems insufficient to overcome the explicit denials, House re-election filing, and Governor race consideration my research assistant documented. I agree with both that visible campaign infrastructure (staff hires, FEC filings, donor activity) is completely absent. My initial forecast of 7% may have been slightly too high given these additional barriers.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm revising downward to 6%. The convergence around 5-8% among all three forecasters suggests this is the appropriate range. Key factors supporting a lower probability: (1) Norman's office explicitly denied Senate plans just 2-3 months ago across multiple outlets; (2) He filed for House re-election, creating institutional momentum; (3) He's reportedly eyeing the Governor's race; (4) Graham has Trump's endorsement - a nearly insurmountable barrier in a GOP primary; (5) SC's filing deadline isn't until spring 2026, removing urgency; (6) Zero visible campaign infrastructure with only 32 days remaining. The probability isn't lower because the June 30 fundraising deadline provides a plausible (if unlikely) reason for a surprise announcement, and politicians occasionally pivot rapidly. However, the compounding barriers - recent denials + alternative plans + endorsement landscape + no filing pressure + no preparation - make 6% appropriate rather than my initial 7%.",
