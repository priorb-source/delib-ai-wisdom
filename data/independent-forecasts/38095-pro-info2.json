  "information": "Since taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The observation period is the month of June 2025, and the question will resolve on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current rate of executive clemency grants under the second Trump administration is exceptionally high, making it very likely that more than two will be granted in any given month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump grants two or fewer instances of executive clemency in June 2025. This could happen if a major political or national security crisis monopolizes the administration's attention for the entire month, or if a significant scandal related to the pardon process forces a temporary moratorium. It's also possible that pardons are being processed in large batches, and June simply falls between two such releases.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump grants three or more pardons or commutations in June 2025. This would be in line with the high-volume clemency apparatus established since January 2025, continuing the trend of rewarding political allies and addressing cases championed by advocates like Alice Marie Johnson.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the data provided by my research assistant. The key takeaway is the establishment of a high-volume, institutionalized clemency process in Trump's second term. While the mass pardon of ~1,500 January 6th defendants is a significant outlier, the subsequent ~100 grants over roughly four months (Jan-Apr) establishes an average rate of approximately 25 clemencies per month. This rate makes the low threshold of 'more than 2' highly likely to be met. The formalization of the process, evidenced by the appointments of a new pardon attorney and a White House 'pardon czar', suggests a steady stream of cases being reviewed and granted, rather than infrequent, ad-hoc decisions. The status quo is a very active pardon pipeline.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 85% to account for the inherent 'lumpiness' of presidential actions. A large batch of pardons could be issued in late May or early July, leaving June with few or none. Furthermore, an unforeseen event, such as a major international crisis or a damaging scandal directly linked to the pardon process, could cause a temporary halt. \n\nThe probability is not lower because doing so would require ignoring the strong evidence of a system built for a high-rate of output. The established monthly average is an order of magnitude greater than the threshold in the question. For the outcome to be 'No', June would have to be a significant anomaly compared to the preceding months of the administration. \n\nI would increase my forecast if administration officials hint at an upcoming batch of pardons in June. I would decrease my forecast significantly if a major pardon-related scandal breaks or if key personnel involved in the process resign.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
