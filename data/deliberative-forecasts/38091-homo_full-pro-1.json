    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the same core pieces of evidence: the high historical rate of new signatories, the recent May 22nd statement from the Acting NASA Administrator mentioning signings in the 'coming weeks', and the primary counterpoint being the lack of a publicly named candidate for June. The key difference between our initial forecasts was the weight assigned to these factors. I found the other forecasters' emphasis on the phrase 'coming weeks' to be particularly convincing. My initial analysis noted the statement but did not fully appreciate its significance as a deliberate, forward-looking signal from a key official suggesting imminent activity. Forecaster 3's analysis was especially persuasive, as it also incorporated the nuance that signings are not perfectly regular, citing the gap in early 2025, which helps temper an overly optimistic forecast like Forecaster 2's 70%. Their reasoning provided a well-calibrated argument for why the probability should be higher than my initial 55% but not as high as 70%.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 55% was based on a near-even balance between the strong trend of new signatories and the significant uncertainty caused by the lack of a named candidate for a June signing. After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I was convinced that I had under-weighted the May 22nd statement from the Acting NASA Administrator. The specific choice of the word 'weeks' is a strong piece of qualitative evidence that suggests an event is anticipated in the very near future, making a June signing more likely than the simple historical base rate would suggest. While the points about potential diplomatic slippage and the lack of a confirmed country remain valid reasons for caution, the combination of the high base rate of signings and this fresh, specific statement from leadership leads me to believe a 'Yes' outcome is more probable than I first assessed. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast by 10 percentage points from 55% to 65%. This new probability better reflects the strong positive momentum while still acknowledging the substantial uncertainty around the precise timing of diplomatic agreements.",
