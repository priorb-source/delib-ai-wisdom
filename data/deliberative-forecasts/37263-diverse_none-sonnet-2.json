    "review": "All three forecasters converged on very low probabilities (5-8%), sharing similar reasoning about the status quo, short timeline, and regulatory barriers. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the regulatory hostility and taxi union opposition, while Forecaster 3 provides valuable Caribbean regional precedent (Cayman, Bahamas) and notes Uber's typical pattern of pre-announcing market entries. The most compelling new argument is Forecaster 3's observation that Uber launches typically feature advance signals (job postings, government statements, press leaks) that are completely absent here. The taxi integration/partnership model mentioned by Forecaster 3 is a valid pathway, but would still require negotiations that would likely have surfaced by now given the 2-month window. Forecaster 2's lower 5% forecast is well-justified by the complete absence of launch signals combined with the April 2025 article showing active regulatory enforcement against 'illegal' taxis, suggesting a particularly hostile environment for ride-sharing entry.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward. The key factors that warrant lowering my estimate are: (1) The complete absence of any launch signals (no job postings, press coverage, government statements, or regulatory pathway announcements) with only 2 months remaining, which Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes as highly unusual for Uber market entries. (2) The April 2025 article indicates not just regulatory barriers but active enforcement against non-traditional taxi services, suggesting a particularly unreceptive environment. (3) Caribbean regional precedent showing consistent resistance from established taxi industries in similar island markets. While I still maintain a small non-zero probability for unexpected rapid partnerships or undisclosed negotiations, the convergence of evidence suggests 8% was slightly generous. The taxi integration model Forecaster 3 mentions is theoretically possible but would require advance planning that should be visible by now. I'm settling on 6% as a compromise between my initial 8% and Forecaster 2's well-reasoned 5%, acknowledging the strength of the 'no signals' argument while maintaining a small buffer for unknown information.",
