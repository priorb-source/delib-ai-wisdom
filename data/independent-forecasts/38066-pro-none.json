    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The event takes place on June 16-17, 2025. The final outcome will be known by the resolution date of July 1, 2025, which is approximately 5 weeks from today.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The default expectation for a conference with multiple headline speakers is that each will have their own separate, scheduled session. Without information to the contrary, the status quo is that they do not appear together.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk both deliver their scheduled talks or participate in their own separate panels at the AI Startup School. Despite being at the same conference, their stage appearances are at different times, and they are never on the same platform together.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Y Combinator has arranged a marquee joint session, such as a debate or a fireside chat, featuring both Sam Altman and Elon Musk to discuss the future of AI. This would be a planned and heavily promoted part of the conference agenda.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high likelihood of the status quo outcome. The default format for conferences is to give individual headline speakers their own distinct slots. A joint appearance is an exception, not the rule, and would typically be advertised in advance to maximize interest, yet no such announcement has been made.\n\nThe most significant factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the well-documented professional rivalry and personal animosity between Sam Altman and Elon Musk. Musk co-founded OpenAI, left the company, has been a vocal critic of its direction under Altman, and founded a competitor, xAI. This contentious relationship makes a voluntary, collaborative stage appearance highly improbable.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% because there are compelling, albeit less likely, countervailing factors. Y Combinator, as the organizer and a highly influential entity in Silicon Valley (with which Altman has deep historical ties), has a massive incentive to orchestrate such a blockbuster event. A joint appearance would generate enormous media attention. Furthermore, Elon Musk's penchant for unpredictable actions and public spectacle means he might agree to a debate-style format. The possibility that YC managed to arrange this as a surprise 'main event' cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the personal friction and standard conference logistics present formidable barriers. The lack of any pre-event marketing for a joint session is strong evidence against it occurring.\n\nI would increase my probability if a conference schedule were released showing a joint session, or if either individual or YC hinted at one. I would decrease my probability if the final schedule showed their sessions were at conflicting times or on different days.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
