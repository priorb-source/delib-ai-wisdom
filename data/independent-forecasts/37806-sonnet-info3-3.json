  "information": "The Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks remain until July 1, 2025. The outcome will be definitively known on July 1, 2025, though it could become clear earlier if a relevant presidential action is published.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if current patterns continue without change, President Trump will not issue a presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues focusing his presidential actions on other immigration priorities without specifically addressing the Diversity Visa program by name. The program continues operating under existing statute through the deadline, with no executive action using the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' published on the White House website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order, presidential memorandum, or proclamation that specifically mentions the 'Diversity Visa' by name - possibly attempting to restrict, suspend, or modify aspects of the program within executive authority, or making a declaratory statement about the program even if substantive changes require Congressional action. This could be triggered by the recent May 3rd lottery results or broader immigration policy initiatives.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Trump has already issued over 40 presidential actions since January 2025 without mentioning the Diversity Visa, establishing a 4+ month pattern. My research assistant confirms no actions have contained this exact phrase despite immigration being a clear priority. The program's statutory basis limits what executive action can meaningfully accomplish, which may explain why Trump hasn't pursued this route despite his documented opposition. However, several factors prevent this from being an extremely low probability: (1) Trump has publicly expressed opposition to the program, as evidenced by the conservative advocacy mentioned in background materials; (2) the DV-2025 lottery results were just released on May 3rd, potentially serving as a catalyst; (3) six weeks remains, providing sufficient time for action; (4) Trump has demonstrated willingness to use executive actions on immigration even when legal authority is contested; (5) he could issue a symbolic or limited-scope action mentioning the program by name. The forecast is not higher because the strong 4-month pattern of inaction suggests this isn't a current priority, and substantive changes require Congress. It's not lower because Trump's immigration focus and known positions make some action plausible, even if primarily symbolic. I would update higher if reports emerged of draft executive orders on immigration programs or if Trump made recent public statements about the Diversity Visa. I would update lower as we approach July 1st without any signs of such action being prepared.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
