    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's observation that 'airline schedules for early July are largely set' by mid-May is compelling - if new routes were launching in 6 weeks, they would almost certainly already be visible in booking systems and GDS. The absence of such evidence is itself strong evidence. Forecaster 3 also identifies meaningful downside risks I didn't fully consider: NRT might not be operating on July 1 (it's described as 'intermittent'), and PUS could be seasonal, potentially reducing the count to just 3 destinations rather than maintaining 4. Both forecasters emphasize the complexity and lead time for international route launches more strongly than I did. Forecaster 2's point about Hong Kong Airlines 'listing' Saipan not necessarily meaning active scheduled service is also well-taken - this is aspirational marketing rather than confirmed operations. The convergence around 15-22% by the other forecasters, both using similar but independent reasoning about timeline constraints, suggests my 30% was too optimistic about the possibility of rapid route additions.",
    "rationale": "I'm revising my forecast downward based on three key insights from the deliberation: (1) The scheduling timeline argument is more constraining than I initially assessed - early July flights should already be bookable and visible in May tracking systems; (2) Downside risks to the current 3-4 count are material - if NRT service is truly intermittent and PUS is seasonal, the July 1 count could be only 3, making the 5+ threshold even harder to reach; (3) The absence of visible evidence of new routes in current tracking, despite being within the normal booking window, is strong negative evidence. My original 30% implied roughly 1-in-3 odds of adding 1-2 routes in 6 weeks with no current evidence - that seems too high given operational realities. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because genuine uncertainty remains about NRT's status, there's non-zero probability of charter-to-scheduled conversions or last-minute seasonal additions from Korean secondary cities, and the Hong Kong and Korean market signals, while not determinative, aren't completely meaningless. I'm settling at 22%, aligned with Forecaster 3's detailed analysis that balances the strong status quo bias with remaining uncertainties.",
