    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the primary driver for a 'Yes' forecast: the positive year-over-year growth in April (+1.49%) and the general inertia of economic data, which creates a significant buffer against a negative outcome for May. However, my peers introduced two crucial points of nuance that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly compelling in identifying the recent growth acceleration as being narrowly concentrated in the volatile energy sector, while non-energy industries have been declining. This makes the positive trend appear more fragile than I initially assessed. Forecaster 3 added another important layer by highlighting external risks, such as slowing global growth (specifically in China) and potential trade disruptions, which directly threaten US export-oriented manufacturing. Both arguments are convincing and temper the optimistic case based on domestic momentum.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 70% to 65%. My initial analysis was balanced but focused primarily on domestic indicators, weighing positive high-frequency data (like May's PMIs) against negative forward-looking indicators (the LEI). The deliberation has convinced me that I underestimated two key risks. First, as Forecaster 2 pointed out, the foundation of the recent growth is narrow and heavily reliant on the energy sector. This makes the high-level positive number more susceptible to sector-specific shocks and less representative of broad industrial health. Second, Forecaster 3's emphasis on global headwinds provides a clear mechanism through which US production could falter, even if domestic demand holds up. These factors increase the probability of a negative surprise that could erase the gains from the previous year. I am not lowering my forecast further because the positive April starting point and expansionary May PMI data remain strong, direct evidence that still makes positive YoY growth the most likely single outcome. However, the newfound fragility of this trend warrants a more cautious stance.",
