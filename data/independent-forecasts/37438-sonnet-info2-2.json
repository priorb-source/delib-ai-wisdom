  "information": "On February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues operations without filing for bankruptcy. The company implements a reverse stock split to address NYSE non-compliance, potentially secures additional financing or restructures existing debt, and continues cost-cutting measures. Management maintains sufficient liquidity to meet near-term obligations through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces an unexpected liquidity crisis - unable to meet imminent debt obligations, fails to secure emergency financing, and creditors threaten legal action. The company's board determines that filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is necessary to reorganize operations and debt structure, filing the petition before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome for several key reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short at only 57 days - bankruptcy filings typically follow extended periods of financial distress with multiple failed turnaround attempts. Second, the NYSE non-compliance notice, while concerning, relates to stock price rather than indicating imminent operational failure or debt default. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure this deficiency through actions like a reverse stock split, suggesting management is actively working on solutions rather than considering bankruptcy. Third, bankruptcy is nearly always a last resort after exhausting alternatives like asset sales, cost reductions, debt restructuring, and seeking new financing. Companies rarely move from apparent operational continuity to bankruptcy filing in under two months without clear warning signs like debt defaults or going concern opinions from auditors. The base rate for bankruptcy filings within a 2-month window for publicly traded companies, even those with stock price challenges, is quite low. However, I'm not forecasting lower because: the stock price persistently below $1.00 indicates genuine market concern about the company's viability; the EV charging infrastructure sector has faced significant financial headwinds; and we lack complete visibility into ChargePoint's immediate liquidity position, upcoming debt maturities, or covenant compliance issues that could force their hand. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of: imminent debt default, going concern warnings, mass executive departures, creditor lawsuits, or reports of failed financing attempts. To revise downward, I would need: successful completion of new financing, detailed financial disclosures showing adequate liquidity through mid-2025, or announcements of major strategic partnerships providing financial support.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
