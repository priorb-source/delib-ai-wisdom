    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened two points I underweighted: (1) the procedural pathway and timelines (Federal Register notices, USITC HTS amendments, USTR actions) that typically precede any country‑wide tariff listing, and (2) how unusual and specific a flat 17% rate is in US practice, especially for a close FTA partner. Forecaster 2’s mention of the VAT‑reciprocity concept (which would imply 17% for Israel) is a useful check; importantly, it is not an active policy under this administration and would likely be broad‑based rather than Israel‑specific. Forecaster 3 emphasized the lack of any credible public signal and the very short runway, which I agree materially suppresses the odds. I find their reasoning convincing and more consistent with historical process norms than my prior, which overweighted the “suspended counts” clause and tail risk.",
    "rationale": "Update: I’m moving down from 18% to 5%.\n\n- Time and process: With ~5 weeks left, an Israel‑specific 17% listing would likely require a presidential proclamation or USTR action plus USITC HTS revisions. There are no FR notices, USTR announcements, or draft HTS changes pointing to this. Even if posted as “suspended,” such a line would still need visible action, which is absent.\n- Rate specificity: A precise 17% across‑the‑board additional duty is atypical for US tariffs (common broad rates are 10%, 25%, etc.). Reverting to MFN or targeted sectoral actions is more plausible than inventing a flat 17% Israel rate.\n- Political context: Imposing a novel, country‑wide tariff on Israel would be extraordinary and politically sensitive; absent clear signaling, the base case is no change before June 1.\n- Resolution nuance: While suspended listings would count, the probability of creating a new Israel‑specific Chapter 99 line at exactly 17% without prior signals is low. Also, the likelihood that some existing IL special rate is exactly 17% in a normal subheading is extremely low given the longstanding US‑Israel FTA (generally Free, with rare exceptions not known to sit at 17%).\n\nWhat would move me up: Any official notice or credible leak of a new reciprocity tariff policy naming 17%, a Section 301/232/IEEPA action targeting Israel with an explicit 17% rate, or draft HTS language adding a Chapter 99 line for Israel at 17% effective by June 1. What would move me down: Continued silence through mid‑May or explicit statements ruling out tariff actions.\n",
