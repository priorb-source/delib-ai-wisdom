    "status_quo_outcome": "No — 5 or fewer direct destinations listed for ROR on flightsfrom.com",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ROR continues with a thin network: United to Guam (and possibly Yap), China Airlines to Taipei, and one Korea or Japan route, totaling no more than 4–5 destinations. No new routes are added or they begin after early July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Peak-summer seasonal capacity returns simultaneously: at least two additional East Asia routes (e.g., both Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai) and/or Manila resume by late June, lifting the listed destinations to 6 or more by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions point to a sparse network. Palau’s post-pandemic recovery has lagged; the referenced Marketplace piece (Apr 2024) notes flights hadn’t restarted in high volume and Korean demand shifting elsewhere. Small island markets typically sustain few year-round routes, with summer-season additions often limited and fragile. As of recent years, durable services likely include Guam (United), Taipei (China Airlines), and potentially Yap (United, depending on schedule), plus an intermittent Korea or Japan link—plausibly 3–5 destinations. To clear >5 by July 1 requires at least two more simultaneous seasonal resumptions, which is a high bar on a short (six-week) horizon given airline planning cycles, demand uncertainty, and Palau’s constraints (no mainland China feed due to diplomatic stance, reliance on subsidies/charters). Still, a non-trivial chance exists: governments and tourism boards sometimes underwrite peak-season flights; Korea/Japan leisure carriers could run July–August schedules that would appear on flightsfrom.com as seasonal non-stop destinations. My weight is on the status quo (world changes slowly), so the most likely outcome is ≤5 destinations by the check date. The research assistant provided no additional info, so I’m relying on market structure, prior route patterns, and timing. Why not higher: limited lead time to add multiple routes and persistent demand/capacity headwinds. Why not lower: seasonal peaks and potential subsidies could push the destination count over the threshold if two or more Asian routes hit at once. Upward update triggers: verified airline announcements/timetables showing at least two additional ROR routes beginning by late June (e.g., both NRT and KIX, or one Japan route plus Manila/Hong Kong/Busan). Downward update triggers: evidence that Yap or a Korea/Japan link is suspended for June–July, or that only one seasonal route is scheduled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
