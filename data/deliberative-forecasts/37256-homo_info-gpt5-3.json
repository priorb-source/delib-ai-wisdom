    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 add useful procedural and capacity detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. F2’s emphasis on the sequential steps (TNLA passage → assent → AU deposit) and the Maputo Protocol’s long ratification timeline strengthens the inertia case. F3 contributes new, concrete indicators of low near‑term movement: few TNLA sittings historically, no trade bills on the May–June calendar, lack of budget provisioning for AfCFTA obligations, and fresh political/security distractions (late‑April high‑level arrests, electoral prep). If accurate, these materially reduce the odds of completing all steps and depositing by July 1. Both also correctly highlight that ratification can be fast‑tracked if leadership prioritizes it, keeping the probability above zero. Overall, I find their reasoning persuasive, especially the absence of order‑paper signals and the deposit bottleneck risk.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down from 35% to 20%. My prior leaned on recent pro‑ratification signals (Trade Minister’s April reaffirmation, EAC technical support) and the possibility of fast‑tracking. The deliberation surfaced credible counter‑evidence: no visible legislative scheduling, limited parliamentary bandwidth, and competing crises, all within a tight ~60‑day window that must also include drafting and depositing instruments. Those process frictions and capacity constraints make a rapid finish less likely than I initially assessed. I still keep the probability non‑trivial because (a) the executive could push a symbolic, low‑cost ratification; (b) once prioritized, legal ratification can move quickly; and (c) regional pressure and business‑community advocacy provide incentives. I would move up on concrete signs of Cabinet approval and bill tabling with expedited readings, TNLA passage, or confirmation that instruments are prepared for immediate deposit; I would move down if May passes with no agenda movement or if political/security disruptions reduce sitting days further.",
