    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core legal and political barriers. F2 adds the useful clarification that not just holding but also scheduling is barred under martial law, implying a law change would be required for an announcement while martial law persists. F3 emphasizes the very short window (≈45 days) and the fresh renewal of martial law as strong revealed-preference evidence. I agree that Poroshenko’s claimed Oct 26 date is weak as evidence for a pre–July 1 announcement, and anonymous sourcing in The Economist now looks stale given the May 15 extension. One added consideration I weigh is the deteriorating security situation (e.g., recent Russian offensive activity around Kharkiv), which further decreases plausibility of early termination of martial law. Overall, I find their reasoning sound and slightly more conservative than my initial take.",
    "rationale": "Baseline barriers are high: (1) Article 19 of the Law on Martial Law prohibits scheduling/holding national elections during martial law; (2) martial law was just extended to Aug 6, 2025; (3) an authorized body (likely the Verkhovna Rada) would need to act to make an announcement count under the resolution criteria; and (4) official denials suggest no current intention. A ‘Yes’ would require either early termination of martial law before July 1 or rapid legal changes to permit scheduling during martial law, followed by an official act setting a date. Politically, doing this weeks after extending martial law—amid active fighting—looks very unlikely. Poroshenko’s Oct 26 claim, even if ultimately right about the eventual date, does not increase the probability of an announcement before July 1 under current law. Given the fresh extension and worsening security backdrop, I’m nudging my forecast down from 6% to 4%. I’d move up on concrete legislative moves to amend the martial law/election framework or credible, on-record signals from Rada leadership/CEC about imminent scheduling; I’d move down on further conflict escalation or renewed official denials.",
