  "information": "American consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The final June 2025 report is expected to be released on the final Friday of June 2025, which would be June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Consumer sentiment remains at or above 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or improves slightly in June, with the final reading at 54.0 or above. This could occur if tariff concerns ease, economic data shows resilience, employment remains strong, or positive policy signals reduce uncertainty. Even with cautious consumer behavior, sentiment could stabilize at modestly pessimistic but not crisis-level readings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment deteriorates further, dropping below 54.0. This could happen if tariff impacts intensify economic concerns, inflation accelerates, labor market weakens, stock market declines sharply, or major negative economic news emerges. The existing consumer caution amplifies into severe pessimism amid mounting financial pressures.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 54.0 represents extreme consumer pessimism, historically associated with severe recessions or economic crises. The research assistant's report indicates significant consumer stress: minimal spending growth (0.2%), elevated savings rate (4.9%), rising student loan delinquencies (7.74%), and preference for discount retailers. The Axios article title references a 'consumer sentiment plunge' linked to tariffs, suggesting recent deterioration. However, reaching below 54.0 would require crisis-level pessimism. Historical context shows the index only drops this low during major economic shocks (2008 financial crisis, peak inflation periods). The evidence shows consumer caution but not necessarily panic. Key factors: (1) We're only 3 weeks from the report date, limiting time for dramatic shifts; (2) The specific 54.0 threshold suggests it may be near current levels, making either outcome plausible; (3) Consumer sentiment exhibits volatility but typically changes gradually. My forecast is not higher because the evidence clearly shows consumer stress and the Axios article indicates recent significant deterioration. It's not lower because 54.0 is an extremely low threshold that requires crisis-level conditions, not just caution. I would update higher if positive economic data emerges, tariff concerns ease, or preliminary June readings suggest stability. I would update lower if we see deteriorating employment data, financial market crashes, or preliminary June sentiment readings already below 54.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
