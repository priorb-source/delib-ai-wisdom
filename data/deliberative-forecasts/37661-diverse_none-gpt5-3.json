    "review": "Forecaster 2’s main new point is the claim that top-level “final approval” was granted about a year ago. If true, that long gap without availability is, to me, more bearish than bullish—Starlink typically goes live within months once all key pieces are in place, so a year suggests unresolved regulatory or operational conditions. Their optimistic read (“a year to prepare”) feels less consistent with Starlink’s usual pattern of flipping the map relatively quickly after genuine final licensing. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the six-week timeline and the multi-step path (licensing specifics, lawful intercept/compliance, import/type approvals, payment/onboarding, possible gateway or landing-rights arrangements). That framing aligns with my priors and with base rates, especially in tightly regulated markets like Bangladesh. I find F3’s caution more convincing than F2’s optimism, given the absence of public signals (partner announcements, import clearances, or map/order-page changes).",
    "rationale": "I previously set 42%, balancing the political approval signal against short timelines and typical regulatory frictions. Considering the deliberation: (1) If “final approval” truly dates back roughly a year, the lack of availability to date is a negative signal that outweighs the idea that prep is simply culminating now. (2) Even if approval is more recent, the remaining ~6 weeks is still tight for shifting the Starlink map to “Available” absent evidence of completed licensing formalities, compliance arrangements (e.g., lawful intercept), and terminal import/activation readiness. Bangladesh’s regulatory environment increases the likelihood of conditions like local landing rights or gateway/monitoring requirements, which can elongate timelines. (3) There are plausible Yes paths—Starlink sometimes moves fast post-approval, can leverage ISLs, and might have prepared in parallel—but without corroborating signs (BTRC license detail, distributor/partner, import/type approvals, or delivery windows), I weight the status quo more. Net: I edge down from 42% to 36%, reflecting the stronger case for timeline and regulatory drag while still allowing a meaningful chance that a quick flip happens by late June if behind-the-scenes work is already done.",
