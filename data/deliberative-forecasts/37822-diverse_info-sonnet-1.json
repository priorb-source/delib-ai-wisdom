    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2's point about fundraising quarter timing is particularly strong - campaigns typically prefer to announce at the start of a quarter to report a full period of fundraising in their first public filing. Announcing after July 1 would capture an entire Q3, while a late June announcement would only show a few days of Q2 receipts. This creates a tactical incentive to wait. Both forecasters also emphasized that while July 1, 2025 is ~16 months before November 2026 (within normal announcement windows), there's no urgency to announce this early versus waiting until mid-summer or fall. O'Rourke's own 2022 gubernatorial bid was announced ~12 months out, not 16+. The strategic benefits of waiting (clarity on Cornyn's plans, DSCC recruitment, Democratic field dynamics) outweigh any benefits of announcing in the next 5.5 weeks. I also underweighted the significance of three consecutive statewide losses making him likely more cautious about a fourth run. These are all valid points that strengthen the case for a No resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward from 28% to 26%. The fundraising quarter timing argument is compelling and adds a concrete tactical reason for O'Rourke to wait until after July 1. The lack of visible campaign infrastructure (no FEC filings, no staff hires, no exploratory committee) combined with his conditional public statements suggests he's still in exploration mode, not launch mode. The 5.5 week timeframe remains very short for a major announcement absent any preparation signals. However, I'm not dropping all the way to 24% because: (1) the cluster of forecasts at 24-28% suggests meaningful residual uncertainty, (2) O'Rourke's public openness and statement that he would run 'if Texans want him to' keeps the door genuinely open, and (3) politicians can occasionally move faster than expected when they sense opportunity or pressure. The consensus view that status quo heavily favors No, but ~25% probability acknowledges the non-trivial chance of a surprise announcement in the remaining weeks, seems well-calibrated.",
