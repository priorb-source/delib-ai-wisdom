  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge cools off over the next 4–6 weeks (e.g., hits ~.330–.360), his BABIP regresses toward career norms, and no other qualified player reaches or stays at .400. ESPN’s leaderboard on July 1 shows no qualified hitters at .400+.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge sustains elite contact and luck, hitting roughly .400 over his next ~110–120 AB and remains at or above .400 on July 1. Alternatively, a different qualified hitter surges into the .400s and is listed at .400+ on ESPN that day, or Judge is at .400+ very late in June and misses games (freezing his BA) through July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Current state: As of May 20, Aaron Judge is around .401 after ~46 games; reports have ranged up to .410–.423 in mid-May. His BABIP is an unsustainably high .481 vs. a career ~.344, and his Statcast xBA is ~.362. That combination strongly signals regression toward the mid-.300s or lower.\n- Mechanics to remain ≥.400: By July 1 he likely adds ~110–120 AB. If he’s roughly 68-for-170 now (~.400), he’d need about 45 hits in the next 112 AB (~.403) to be at .400 on July 1. If his true BA going forward is near xBA (~.36), the chance of ≥45/112 is on the order of 15–20%. If his true BA is closer to a shrinkage estimate (~.33), it’s nearer 5–10%. The truth likely lies between, implying low but nontrivial odds.\n- Other contenders: Historically, maintaining .400 into July is rare. Outside Judge, it’s unlikely another qualified hitter will be at .400 by July 1; add only a small tail probability (≈1–2%).\n- ESPN leaderboard nuance: ESPN typically defaults to qualified hitters; Judge will likely qualify by July 1. If only qualified players are considered (as is standard on ESPN’s main stats page), this primarily comes down to Judge. If non-qualified players were considered, fringe cases could inflate odds slightly, but resolution text points to ESPN’s stats page, which usually filters to qualified by default.\n- Why not higher? Extremely elevated BABIP and xBA well below .400 argue for regression; small slumps can drop BA below .400 quickly at this stage. Historical base rates for .400 on July 1 are very low.\n- Why not lower? Judge’s current performance level and contact quality justify some chance he sustains an elite run over the next ~6 weeks; fewer than 120 AB leaves room for variance, and an injury or rest at the right time could freeze a .400+ mark on July 1.\n- What would change my view:\n  • Upward: Judge still ≥.400 by mid-June; sustained BABIP >.420 with elite hard-hit and K% trends; another qualified hitter climbs to ≥.390 by early/mid-June; confirmation that the resolver will accept non-qualified players displayed on ESPN.\n  • Downward: Judge slips below ~.390 by end of May/early June; notable decline in hard-hit%/xBA; injury that keeps him playing through a slump, or tougher pitching matchups suppressing hits for an extended stretch.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
