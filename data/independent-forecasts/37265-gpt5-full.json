  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Tanzania remains Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution, with some regional Level 3 areas noted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security conditions remain broadly stable: occasional crime and isolated security alerts (e.g., coastal warnings) continue, but there is no major terrorist incident, no sharp rise in violent crime affecting foreigners, and no nationwide civil unrest. The State Department keeps Tanzania at Level 2 and maintains or fine-tunes regional cautions (e.g., Mtwara).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant deterioration in security occurs before July 1: for example, an attack linked to the Mozambique insurgency inside Tanzania (especially in coastal tourist zones, Zanzibar, or population centers), a series of targeted violent crimes against foreigners, or widespread political unrest with heavy security-force response. The U.S. Embassy issues multiple urgent alerts or restricts staff movement, prompting State to elevate the nationwide advisory to Level 3.",
    "rationale": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania is Level 2 (last updated Sept 9, 2024), with a higher Level 3 warning for specific areas (e.g., Mtwara). The U.S. Embassy issued a coastal security alert in March 2025. Nearby or comparable countries have recently been elevated to Level 3 (e.g., Uganda, Burundi; also Bangladesh and Trinidad & Tobago) due to terrorism risks, violent crime, civil unrest, or discriminatory laws. A plausible risk for Tanzania is spillover from Mozambique’s insurgency, with activity reported as recently as April 2025 near the border.\n\nHowever, good forecasting puts weight on inertia: Tanzania has been stable at Level 2 for years, and State often addresses localized risks via regional restrictions rather than nationwide upgrades. For a countrywide Level 3 within roughly 60 days, there would typically need to be a substantial event (e.g., a high-profile attack or sustained deterioration impacting multiple regions or foreign visitors). A single embassy alert rarely triggers a nationwide jump. Tanzania’s crime profile, while nontrivial (muggings, robberies), has not shown an acute nationwide surge akin to places recently raised to Level 3; terrorism incidents within Tanzania have been infrequent since the 2020 cross-border episode, and authorities have maintained a security presence in the south. The election cycle (general elections expected later in 2025) could produce tensions, but major pre-election unrest before July is not the base case.\n\nWhy not higher: Short time horizon; historical stability at Level 2; U.S. preference to keep Level 2 with regional Level 3 caveats absent broad-based deterioration; no recent major incident in Tanzania proper. Why not lower: Credible tail risks exist—spillover from Mozambique’s insurgency, the March 2025 embassy alert signaling concern along the coast, and a recent pattern of State upgrading some countries where terrorism/crime risks intensified.\n\nWhat would move me up: A significant attack in Tanzania (especially in coastal tourist areas or Zanzibar), multiple/new embassy security alerts restricting U.S. staff movements, a sharp increase in violent crime affecting foreigners, or serious unrest with heavy security-force responses. What would move me down: Passage of time without incidents through early June, fewer or no additional embassy alerts, or explicit reaffirmation of Level 2 in a routine update.",
