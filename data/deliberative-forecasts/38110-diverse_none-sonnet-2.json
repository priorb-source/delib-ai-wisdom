    "review": "I made a critical error in my initial analysis. I stated there was 'less than 1 day remaining' when in fact there is approximately one month until July 1, 2025. This fundamentally changes the forecast. Both forecasters correctly identified this one-month timeframe and appropriately weighted it in their analyses. They also raised valuable points I hadn't fully considered: (1) Historical precedent of Nigeria's own 2019-2021 border closure showing these can persist, (2) The possibility that Benin is using the closure as political leverage to force Nigerian action on security issues, (3) The role of ECOWAS relationships and trade pressures that could accelerate reopening, and (4) The distinction between de facto easing versus credibly reported reopening. Their reasoning about security-led closures typically outlasting one month is sound, as is their acknowledgment that intense diplomatic effort could still produce a rapid resolution. However, I find their 20-25% forecasts slightly optimistic given: the very recent closure (just weeks ago), the serious security rationale cited (new terror group, arms smuggling), and the complete absence of any reported diplomatic initiatives or signals of imminent talks. The status quo bias remains strong even with the corrected timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Correcting my temporal miscalculation dramatically changes the analysis. One month provides meaningful time for high-level diplomatic engagement and political decisions, unlike one day. The security issues cited—a named terror group (Mahmuda), arms smuggling, and trade disputes—are substantial but not necessarily insurmountable within a month if there's political will from both governments. Economic pressure from affected border communities and Nigeria's status as a regional power could compel faster action than typical security closures. However, several factors constrain the probability: the closure is extremely recent (May 2025), suggesting initial positions are likely entrenched; there are no reported diplomatic initiatives or talks underway; security-based closures in the region historically persist for months; and the credible reporting requirement means even informal easing may not count. The 20-25% range from other forecasters acknowledges these dynamics but may underweight the absence of positive signals. I'm updating substantially from 8% due to the corrected timeframe, but settling slightly below the other forecasts at 18% given the lack of any evidence suggesting imminent resolution and the serious security justifications that typically resist rapid reversal.",
