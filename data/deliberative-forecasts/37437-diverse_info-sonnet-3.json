    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my forecast. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly important point I underweighted: the resolution criteria requires the U.S. to specifically use the term 'invading Taiwan' with ground military forces. This is a meaningful constraint - for limited incidents or outlying island seizures, Washington might deliberately choose less escalatory language like 'attack,' 'assault,' or 'incursion' for diplomatic flexibility. This linguistic requirement creates an additional hurdle beyond just a military incident occurring. Both forecasters also effectively emphasize the 2027 readiness timeline and the absence of observable invasion preparations. However, Forecaster 2's mention of a 300% increase in military pressure in 2024 suggests elevated near-term risk that shouldn't be entirely dismissed. While I agree the base rate strongly favors the status quo, the CFR's 'moderately likely' security crisis assessment for 2025 (not just 2027) and heightened military activity suggest the tail risk is non-trivial. The forecasters' range of 1-2% appropriately reflects the balance between extremely low probability and non-zero tail risk.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward from 3% to 2%. The key factor driving this adjustment is Forecaster 3's astute observation about resolution criteria specificity - the U.S. must publicly use the specific phrase 'invading Taiwan' rather than alternative formulations. Given diplomatic sensitivities and escalation management concerns, U.S. officials might deliberately avoid such stark language even for serious incidents. This creates a linguistic barrier to resolution that I initially underweighted. However, I'm not going as low as 1% because: (1) The 300% increase in military pressure noted by Forecaster 2 indicates meaningfully elevated near-term tensions; (2) CFR's 'moderately likely' assessment applies to 2025 broadly, not just post-2027; (3) While full-scale invasion is extremely unlikely, a limited action that Washington chooses to characterize as 'invasion' to rally international response remains possible; (4) Accidental escalation from grey-zone operations could spiral. The extremely short timeframe (~8 weeks), absence of visible invasion preparations, high costs to China, and 2027 readiness timeline all strongly support a very low probability. 2% reflects this balance: acknowledging the overwhelmingly likely status quo while accounting for non-zero tail risk in an elevated-tension environment.",
