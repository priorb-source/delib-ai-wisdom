    "review": "The other forecasters converged on similar probabilities (77% and 72%) and emphasized the same key factors I identified. Forecaster 3 made a particularly compelling quantitative argument: for Conservatives to overtake the Bloc, they would need to roughly triple their 2021 performance (from 10 to 30+ seats) while the Bloc collapses by about two-thirds (from 32 to below that threshold). This stark mathematical framing crystallizes just how unprecedented such a swing would be. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point I underweighted: even if the Bloc loses 10-15 seats to a Liberal surge, they would still likely maintain their lead over Conservatives unless Conservatives also gain substantially. Both forecasters correctly emphasized that Quebec politics is traditionally a Liberal-Bloc competition, and that a Liberal surge under Carney primarily threatens the Bloc but doesn't automatically benefit Conservatives - those seats would flow to Liberals, not Conservatives. The structural separation between where Liberals compete (francophone regions against the Bloc) and where Conservatives have their limited base (suburban Montreal, parts of Quebec City) is important. The Conservative candidate issue in Quebec City that both forecasters noted actually reinforces Conservative weakness rather than strength.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find the quantitative framing particularly persuasive. The required shift is not just large but mathematically extreme: Conservatives need to more than triple their seat count while the Bloc collapses by two-thirds, all within months of an election. The structural dynamics of Quebec politics work against this. The Carney Liberal surge, if it materializes, would primarily redistribute seats between Liberals and Bloc, not suddenly make Quebec Conservative-friendly territory. Even in Harper's majority governments, Conservatives struggled in Quebec. The 22-seat historical margin from 2021 deserves significant weight. I'm updating slightly upward from my initial 78% to 80% because the mathematical case for how unlikely a Conservative overtaking is even stronger than I initially weighted. However, I'm not going much higher because we lack current polling data and genuine uncertainty exists about how Carney's entry reshapes the race. The forecast remains in the 'confident but not certain' range, which appropriately reflects both the strong historical pattern and the acknowledged volatility in Quebec politics.",
