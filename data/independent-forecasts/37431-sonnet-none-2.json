    "rationale": "The recall was issued on April 24, 2025, making it only 11 days old as of today. This means there are 68 days total from recall issuance to the July 1 deadline. USDA/FSIS recalls typically take considerable time to close due to multiple required steps: physical removal of products from commerce, company verification of removal, FSIS verification of recall effectiveness, and completion of all documentation. The status quo strongly favors recalls remaining Active, as the bureaucratic process is deliberately thorough. Positive factors include: (1) a relatively generous 2.3-month timeframe, (2) the recall involves mislabeling/allergen issues rather than contamination which may be simpler to resolve, and (3) the defined product scope of approximately 65,000 pounds. Negative factors include: (1) the recall is very recent with minimal time for action to date, (2) even with perfect company cooperation, FSIS verification processes take time, and (3) historical data suggests most recalls remain open for several months or longer. While not impossible, a closure within 68 days would be relatively expeditious. My forecast would be higher if there were evidence of rapid company response or smaller recall scope, and lower if this were a contamination-based recall or if the company showed signs of non-cooperation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
