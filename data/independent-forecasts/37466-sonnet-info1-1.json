  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days (from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains their current naming convention on the North America map page, waiting for international consensus or sticking with the internationally recognized 'Gulf of Mexico' name despite the U.S. executive order",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America page to reflect the U.S. government's adopted nomenclature, displaying 'Gulf of America' either alone or alongside the traditional name in parentheses",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Key considerations: (1) WorldAtlas.com is a private commercial educational website, not bound by U.S. government naming conventions. (2) It has been approximately 3.5 months since Executive Order 14172 was signed, yet the North America page presumably has not been updated, suggesting editorial reluctance. (3) However, WorldAtlas has acknowledged the name change by including '(Gulf of America)' in their Gulf of Mexico article title, showing awareness and some accommodation. (4) Major U.S. federal agencies (NHC, Coast Guard) have adopted the new name, creating pressure for U.S.-based websites to follow. (5) The name change lacks international recognition, which educational geography websites typically prioritize. The forecast is not higher because: most of the time period has elapsed without change, international geographic bodies haven't adopted the name, and private websites often maintain internationally recognized nomenclature over politically-driven changes. The forecast is not lower because: WorldAtlas has already shown willingness to acknowledge the new name, we still have 54 days remaining, and the continued adoption by federal agencies creates ongoing pressure. I would update higher if: evidence emerged of WorldAtlas updating other map pages, statements from WorldAtlas about editorial policy changes, or broader adoption by other major geography websites. I would update lower if: explicit statements from WorldAtlas maintaining traditional nomenclature, or evidence of international geographic organizations rejecting the name change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
