    "review": "- Forecaster 2: Largely aligns with my priors. Emphasizes Johnsonville’s faster historical closeouts (4–8 weeks) and the single-date lot, with appropriate caution for Class I rigor and plastic contamination. No new facts, but a sound framing; their 65% feels reasonable as a central estimate.\n- Forecaster 3: Adds the useful framing of the 87-day window and argues a notional median of ~90 days for Class I recalls. That median claim isn’t strongly evidenced from the provided data (2–4 months is a wide band and small, single-lot recalls can close sooner). The “status quo is Active” point isn’t very diagnostic at day 34. Still, the posting/verification rigor and potential for longer plastic-related investigations are legitimate downward pressures I may have underweighted.\nOverall: F3’s caution nudges me slightly lower due to timing and administrative/posting-lag risks; F2’s argument supports keeping the forecast in the likely-but-not-certain range.",
    "rationale": "I previously forecast 70%. After weighing the deliberation:\n- Time: 53 days remain to July 1, giving ample runway for a small, single-date, 10-state recall to complete effectiveness checks and corrective action verification, particularly for an experienced firm like Johnsonville.\n- Scope/complexity: Single production date (~22.7k lbs) favors faster closure; no injuries reported. FSIS boilerplate about product possibly in freezers doesn’t preclude closure once retail removal and checks are verified.\n- Downside risks: Class I foreign material recalls often require clear root-cause and preventive controls; if those take longer or the recall expands, closure could slip. There’s also some risk that even if operationally closed late June, the website status change posts after July 1.\n- Base rates: The 2–4 month range suggests July 1 (at ~2.85 months) is near the middle of typical timelines. Johnsonville’s past 4–8 week pattern is encouraging but not definitive for a Class I plastic recall.\nNet: Likely to close before July 1, but the Class I plastic context and posting-lag risk warrant trimming. I’m moving down 6 points, from 70% to 64%. I would move up on evidence of completed effectiveness checks/root-cause and corrective actions, or retailer confirmations; down on any expansion, new incidents, or signs of extended FSIS verification.\n",
