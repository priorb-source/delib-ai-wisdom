  "information": "There is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, with the deadline being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If no new legislation is enacted, Ohio's voter verification requirements will not be expanded to include additional proof of citizenship. This would result in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the Republican supermajority's interest in the issue, a bill to expand citizenship verification requirements stalls in the legislative process. It may get held up in committee, or the House and Senate may fail to agree on an identical version before the July 1, 2025 deadline, due to focusing on other legislative priorities like the state budget.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Republican supermajority in the Ohio General Assembly prioritizes an election integrity bill early in the session. Using a pre-existing template like the previous session's Senate Bill 153, they fast-track the legislation through committees and floor votes, ensuring both chambers pass an identical bill before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on balancing the strong political will for this legislation against significant procedural and time constraints. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the political landscape in Ohio: Republicans hold supermajorities in both the House and Senate and occupy the governor's office. The research provided indicates a national trend and party-level focus on this issue, making it a likely priority. Precedent for a bill exists from the previous session (SB 153), providing a ready template that could accelerate the legislative process.\n\nHowever, the status quo is a powerful force in any legislative body, and the timeline is the single largest obstacle. With less than two months until the deadline, the window to introduce, debate, pass a bill through committees in both chambers, and get a final floor vote in both is extremely tight. Legislative calendars can be filled with other priorities, and even with a supermajority, procedural delays or internal disagreements on the bill's final text can easily push enactment past the deadline. The fact that a similar bill did not pass in the previous 2-year session suggests it is not a simple or universally agreed-upon matter, even within the majority party.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the legislative process has inherent friction, and the short timeframe makes the status quo (a 'No' outcome) the most probable result. Inertia is difficult to overcome quickly.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of a party-line supermajority and a high-salience national political issue creates a very favorable environment for this type of legislation. If the legislative leadership makes this a top priority, they possess the power to overcome procedural hurdles and pass it within the given timeframe.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a bill is introduced and quickly passes out of committee in either chamber. I would decrease my forecast if no bill has been introduced by late May or if the legislature's official agenda becomes dominated by budgetary or other pressing matters.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
