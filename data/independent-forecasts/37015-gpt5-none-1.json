    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han maintains caretaker posture as Acting President, cites neutrality norms and/or legal/political constraints, while PPP coalesces around an alternative candidate; no formal candidacy announcement is made before May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PPP pressure intensifies amid June snap-election timelines; Han signals openness, resigns or sets steps to comply with election law timing, and publicly announces his presidential bid before May 5.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/context: The prompt cites reporting that PPP figures are pushing to draft Acting President Han for a June election, implying a vacancy-triggered snap presidential race. Historically, South Korea’s acting presidents (e.g., Hwang Kyo-ahn in 2017) have declined to run to preserve neutrality and avoid legal/political complications. Han Duck-soo is a technocratic figure and older than typical contenders, reducing prior likelihood of a late-entry presidential run. With only ~13 days left, absent visible campaign moves, the base expectation is no announcement by May 5.\n- Timing/legal/practical considerations: Candidate registration and resign-to-run requirements for senior public officials typically force decisions weeks before election day. If the election is in June, a decision would need to come very soon—this keeps a non-trivial chance alive—but we would expect clear signals (formation of a camp, senior-staff hires, public trial balloons, or resignation chatter). Lacking such signals in hand, the status quo favors No.\n- Why not higher: Precedent against acting presidents running, Han’s profile/age, and the short window without clear movement all weigh against a sudden announcement.\n- Why not lower: The reported PPP draft push and compressed snap-election calendar create a plausible pathway where party elites converge on Han as a unity/status-quo steward, prompting a quick announcement before registration deadlines.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of Han meeting party kingmakers about a run; indications of him forming an exploratory team; legal consultations about resignation timing; public statements of openness; leaked timelines; formal steps to resign.\n- What would move me down: Public declination by Han; PPP coalescing around another named candidate; legal/administrative deadlines passing or clarified to require earlier steps than May 5; reporting that the draft effort fizzled.\n- Research assistant info: None beyond the cited headline; thus I lean on precedent, base rates, and timing heuristics, which favor No but leave a meaningful tail risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
