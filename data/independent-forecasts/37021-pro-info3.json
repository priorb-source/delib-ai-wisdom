  "information": "The primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. The inflation data for April 2025 is expected to be released by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and reported by Trading Economics in early to mid-May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The prevailing trend heading into 2025 was one of decelerating inflation from its 2022-2023 peaks, with official forecasts (e.g., from the NBU) predicting a rise, but to levels well below 15% for the year. The status quo assumes that these underlying disinflationary trends and policy responses would contain the acceleration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Bank of Ukraine's tight monetary policy effectively anchors inflation expectations. Suppressed consumer demand prevents businesses from fully passing on increased costs. A favorable spring harvest season leads to a significant seasonal drop in food prices, counteracting the inflationary pressures from the energy and labor sectors.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe and intensifying attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout early 2025 create a major cost-push shock, drastically increasing business operating costs. This, combined with labor shortages from ongoing mobilization and a potential currency depreciation, fuels a rapid acceleration in prices that overwhelms the NBU's efforts.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards Yes, primarily due to the overwhelming impact of recent cost-push shocks which likely outweigh the pre-existing disinflationary pressures. The received intelligence highlights several key inflationary drivers: intensified attacks on energy infrastructure, population mobilization creating labor shortages, and a reported 18-19% year-over-year increase in the cost of the Easter food basket. This latter data point is a particularly strong short-term indicator of rapidly accelerating food prices, a major component of the CPI. While the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) maintains a tight monetary policy and consumer demand is weak—factors that would normally contain inflation—the scale of the recent supply-side shocks, particularly to energy, is likely too severe to be fully absorbed. These events appear to have fundamentally altered the inflation outlook from just a few months ago, making the official NBU forecast of 8.6% for 2025 seem outdated. My forecast is not higher because the NBU's policy and weak domestic demand still provide a significant brake on runaway inflation, preventing a more extreme outcome. My forecast is not lower because ignoring the cascading effects of the energy crisis and the direct evidence from recent food price data would be imprudent. I would revise my forecast downwards if a significant and rapid restoration of energy capacity occurs or if a massive tranche of international aid directly stabilizes the currency and budget. Conversely, I would revise it upwards upon any further major military escalation, significant currency devaluation, or signs of the government resorting to monetary financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
