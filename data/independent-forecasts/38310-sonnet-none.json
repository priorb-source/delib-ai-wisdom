    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. G7 summits typically occur mid-to-late June, and today is June 3, 2025. The outcome will be known by the end of June 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Zelenskyy attends. He has received a formal invitation from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and there is strong historical precedent of him attending G7 summits when invited (Hiroshima 2023 in person, 2022 virtually).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden military crisis in Ukraine requires Zelenskyy to remain in Kyiv to coordinate defense efforts. Alternatively, critical peace negotiations emerge that demand his presence elsewhere, or security intelligence suggests travel risks are too high despite Canadian security assurances.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The military situation in Ukraine remains stable enough for him to travel. Canada successfully arranges secure transportation. Zelenskyy recognizes the diplomatic importance of attending in person to lobby for continued military and financial support from G7 nations, and the summit proceeds as scheduled without disruption.",
    "rationale": "Given that we're already at the beginning of June 2025 and Zelenskyy has received a formal invitation, the base probability is quite high. Several factors strongly favor attendance: (1) Historical precedent - Zelenskyy attended the 2023 G7 summit in Hiroshima in person and has made attending international summits a priority; (2) Strong incentives - Ukraine depends critically on G7 countries for military aid, financial support, and diplomatic backing; (3) Timing - we're already in June, suggesting travel and security arrangements are likely well advanced; (4) No reported obstacles - the research assistant found no information suggesting cancellation or complications. The main risks are unexpected military developments requiring his presence in Ukraine, security concerns about international travel during wartime, or unforeseen diplomatic complications. However, these would need to emerge suddenly and be severe enough to override the significant diplomatic value of attending. The probability is not higher (90%+) because unexpected battlefield developments or security threats could force a last-minute cancellation, as has happened with some of Zelenskyy's planned trips. It's not lower (60-70%) because the formal invitation, strong precedent, critical timing (already June), and lack of known obstacles all point toward attendance being the default outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
