  "information": "The broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and makes no announcements regarding an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's leadership decides that the current market, while improving, is still too selective to guarantee a successful IPO at their desired valuation. They also prioritize resolving the ongoing, high-profile lawsuit with Deel and focusing resources on their international expansion before taking on the significant distraction of going public. They continue business as usual past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having been preparing confidentially for months, Rippling's board sees a favorable window of opportunity created by other successful tech IPOs. They decide to act quickly to capitalize on the momentum and file their S-1 or post an official announcement on their company blog in late June 2025, signaling their intent to go public.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans heavily on the status quo, as the timeline for an IPO announcement is extremely short. The most significant factor against a 'Yes' outcome is the combination of this tight deadline (under six weeks) and Rippling's current operational focus. The company is engaged in a high-profile legal battle with Deel and is actively expanding internationally. Major litigation often serves as a deterrent to an IPO, as it introduces uncertainty that can repel investors and complicate valuation. Companies typically prefer a clear narrative before facing public market scrutiny. Furthermore, these activities require significant management attention, making it less likely they would simultaneously orchestrate an imminent IPO announcement. While the thawing IPO market and competitor activity (Chime, Klarna) create some pressure to act, the market is described as 'selective,' meaning a company with a major legal overhang might choose to wait for more favorable conditions. The probability is not lower because the tech IPO window can be unpredictable, and other companies are successfully moving forward. Rippling could have a confidential filing already prepared and may decide to pull the trigger unexpectedly to capitalize on a perceived market high. I would increase my forecast if credible reports of an imminent filing from sources like Bloomberg emerged, or if Rippling and Deel announced a sudden settlement. I would decrease my forecast if Rippling announced a new private funding round, which would reduce the short-term need for public capital.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
