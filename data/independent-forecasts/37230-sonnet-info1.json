  "information": "Economic challenges and trade policy are key sources of market uncertainty. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have led to downward revisions of corporate earnings expectations. A Goldman Sachs model predicts that a 5% increase in tariffs could lead to a 1-2% decline in S&P 500 earnings per share. Sevens Report notes that even with reduced trade tensions, the base level of tariffs will remain much higher than in January, acting as a barrier to growth and a driver of inflation. Analysts at Barclays have expressed skepticism about whether there is enough momentum in U.S.-China trade discussions to avoid a U.S. recession.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. Today is April 29, 2025, and the outcome will be determined by comparing the closing values on the final trading days of April and May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Historically, the S&P 500 rises in approximately 54-55% of all months, suggesting a baseline slight positive bias. However, given current market conditions with elevated uncertainty, the status quo over a one-month period would be relatively flat with high volatility.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trade tensions escalate further with additional tariffs announced or implemented. Corporate earnings reports for Q1 disappoint significantly, confirming analyst concerns about tariff impacts. Economic data weakens substantially, raising recession fears. The Federal Reserve maintains restrictive policy stance despite economic concerns. These factors combine to drive the S&P 500 lower through May, resulting in a month-end close below April's final level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trade negotiations show meaningful progress, with announcements of tariff reductions or exemptions. Corporate earnings prove more resilient than feared, with companies successfully navigating the tariff environment. Economic data stabilizes or improves, reducing recession concerns. The Fed signals potential policy accommodation. Market sentiment improves as investors price in better outcomes, driving the S&P 500 higher through May to close above April's level.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant highlights significant headwinds: tariffs driving earnings downgrades (Goldman's 1-2% EPS decline estimate), persistently elevated tariff levels creating growth barriers and inflation pressures, and analyst skepticism about avoiding recession. These are meaningful fundamental concerns that create downward pressure.\n\nHowever, several factors prevent an extremely bearish forecast: (1) One-month timeframes are dominated by volatility and randomness rather than fundamentals; (2) Markets are forward-looking and may have already priced in some tariff impacts; (3) The historical baseline shows markets rise slightly more often than they fall monthly; (4) We're at month-end, leaving little time for April's close to change dramatically.\n\nThe challenging fundamental backdrop - tariffs, earnings pressure, recession risks - warrants weighting below the ~54% historical baseline for positive months. However, the short timeframe and market efficiency suggest these negatives may be partially incorporated.\n\nThis forecast would move higher with: concrete positive trade developments, resilient earnings reports, stabilizing economic data, or late-April market strength establishing positive momentum. It would move lower with: tariff escalation, weak economic data, poor earnings, or sharp late-April selling pressure.\n\nBalancing the negative fundamental backdrop against short-term market volatility and potential pricing-in of concerns, I estimate a slightly below-neutral probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market?

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
