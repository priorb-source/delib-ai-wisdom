  "information": "Multiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 19 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite his stated desire to step down, Kadyrov continues in his position through June 1 as the formal transition process takes longer than three weeks, requires Moscow's approval and coordination, or the statement was intended as political signaling rather than an immediate resignation announcement",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's health deteriorates rapidly or the succession plan accelerates, leading to his formal resignation or replacement within the next 19 days, with his son Adam or another designated successor taking over as Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Kadyrov remaining in power through June 1. While the Moscow Times article from May 6 reporting Kadyrov's desire to step down is significant, and the research assistant's report confirms health issues and succession planning, political transitions of this magnitude rarely occur within three weeks. Key factors supporting a lower probability: (1) No concrete resignation date was announced; (2) The timeframe is extremely short for replacing a leader who has held power since 2007; (3) His 17-year-old son's youth suggests a need for careful, gradual transition rather than immediate handover; (4) Such transitions in the Russian political system require coordination with Moscow and cannot be unilaterally rushed; (5) Statements about stepping down from autocratic leaders often serve political purposes without immediate action. Factors that prevent an even lower forecast: (1) The statement was made very recently (6 days ago); (2) Multiple credible reports of serious health issues; (3) Active succession planning is clearly underway; (4) The short remaining timeframe means any transition would need to happen soon if at all. For me to update higher, I would need: credible reports of an imminent resignation date, Moscow's public support for transition, or critical health emergency. For me to update lower: Kadyrov appearing publicly in good health, statements denying resignation plans, or reports that succession planning is long-term rather than immediate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
