  "information": "Since taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~33 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House pauses clemency announcements for June—e.g., to avoid pre-convention controversy or amid adverse press—resulting in zero, one, or two publicly disclosed grants during the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Routine processing and periodic announcements continue, producing a small batch of >2 clemencies (e.g., a handful of ally/celebrity cases, additional Jan 6-related cases, or a themed Juneteenth/nonviolent drug clemency action). A blanket or category-based order would also easily clear the threshold.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline behavior: According to the assistant’s report, Trump has issued ~1,600 clemencies since January 2025, driven by a mass order (~1,500 Jan 6-related) plus ongoing grants afterward. Even net of the day-one surge, that implies dozens to roughly 100 additional clemencies through late May, suggesting continued activity rather than a one-off event.\n- Infrastructure: Installation of Ed Martin as DOJ pardon attorney and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar indicates an institutionalized pipeline, which supports ongoing, publicly disclosed clemency. The bar for this question (>2 in a month) is very low.\n- Optics and cadence risks: Recent criticism (e.g., Guardian’s coverage of costs of white-collar pardons) could prompt a temporary slowdown or tighter message discipline in June, especially ahead of the July convention and late-June Supreme Court news cycles. Announcements can be lumpy; a month with zero is possible if they batch for July.\n- Public disclosure requirement: Grants only count if made public. While the Trump team typically publicizes clemency for political credit, any delay in disclosure to July would reduce June counts. This is a key reason I’m not above ~90%.\n- Why not higher: Potential strategic pause in June, lumpy release patterns, and the disclosure timing risk.\n- Why not lower: The recent volume, dedicated personnel, Trump’s demonstrated willingness to use clemency for allies and constituencies, and the very low threshold (>2) collectively make “Yes” the status quo outcome.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of an impending June clemency tranche (especially themed around Juneteenth or another category), leaks of prepared warrants, or WH comms signaling a June push.\n- What would move me down: Reports of a moratorium or deliberate pause until after the convention, staffing/processing bottlenecks, or guidance that announcements will be bundled in July instead of June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
