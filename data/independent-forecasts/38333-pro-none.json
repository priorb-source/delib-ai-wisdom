    "status_quo_outcome": "No, as Francis Suarez has not announced a candidacy for governor of Florida.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The date July 1, 2025, arrives, and Francis Suarez has not made any official announcement or filed paperwork declaring his candidacy for governor of Florida. He may decide the timing is not right, that the potential primary field is too strong, or to pursue other opportunities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, Francis Suarez holds a press conference, releases a video, or files official paperwork with the state of Florida, formally announcing that he is a candidate for governor.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeline. Today is June 5, 2025, leaving less than four weeks until the deadline. Launching a credible statewide campaign for governor of a major state like Florida requires extensive preparation, including fundraising, staff hiring, and strategic planning, which typically becomes public knowledge weeks or months ahead of a formal announcement. The status quo is that he is not a candidate, and major political candidacies rarely materialize from a mere 'consideration' to a full launch in such a brief period without significant preceding signals. While the May 2 Axios report confirms his interest, there has been no subsequent reporting of concrete steps, such as forming an exploratory committee or hiring campaign staff, which would indicate an imminent announcement. His brief 2024 presidential campaign showed ambition but also may have left him and his donor network cautious about another major race so soon. The probability is not lower than 10% because Suarez is an ambitious politician who could opt for a surprise announcement to generate media attention, and the background report does confirm he is actively considering it. The probability is not higher because the logistical hurdles and lack of public groundwork make an announcement within the next 26 days highly improbable. I would increase my forecast upon seeing reports of key campaign hires or significant fundraising activities. I would decrease it if he makes a statement ruling out a run or as time passes without any new developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
