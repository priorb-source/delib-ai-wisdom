    "review": "The other forecasters presented critical arguments that I had overlooked and which convincingly dismantled the premise of my initial high-confidence forecast. My 95% probability was based on the simple assumption that the absence of information about opponents meant there were no credible ones. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 correctly challenged this. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out that a scheduled primary implies competition and that a lack of information is a sign of uncertainty, not necessarily of a cleared field. Forecaster 3 provided a masterful, domain-specific analysis of Virginia Democratic primary dynamics, highlighting the structural advantages a Northern Virginia (NOVA) or prosecutor-archetype candidate would have against Jones, who is from Hampton Roads. Forecaster 3's reference to Jones's 2021 primary loss was a crucial piece of data, demonstrating he is beatable. Their reasoning was superior to my own, forcing a fundamental re-evaluation of the question.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, moving from 95% to 45%. My initial confidence was based on a flawed interpretation of the 'no additional information' report. I mistakenly took the absence of evidence for an opponent as evidence of their absence. The other forecasters have convinced me this is incorrect.\n\nMy new rationale is based on these points:\n1.  **A Scheduled Primary Implies an Opponent:** As Forecaster 2 argued, the fact a primary is scheduled just two weeks out strongly indicates that at least one other candidate has qualified for the ballot. This invalidates my assumption that Jones is running unopposed.\n2.  **Structural Disadvantages:** Forecaster 3's analysis of Virginia's political geography is key. Primaries are often won and lost in high-turnout Northern Virginia. As a candidate from Hampton Roads, Jones must overcome this structural disadvantage if he faces a credible opponent from NOVA. Furthermore, the argument that a prosecutor may have an advantage in an Attorney General primary is a classic and plausible dynamic.\n3.  **Past Performance:** Jones's 2021 primary performance (43% against an incumbent) shows he is a strong candidate with a statewide base, but it also establishes that he is not invincible in a primary contest. An open seat in 2025 likely attracted credible challengers.\n\nGiven these factors, the race is far more uncertain than I initially believed. It is much closer to a toss-up. I am placing my forecast slightly below 50% to reflect the structural headwinds Jones faces, but not as low as 40% because his relatively high name ID from his 2021 run still gives him a meaningful advantage over any lesser-known challenger.",
