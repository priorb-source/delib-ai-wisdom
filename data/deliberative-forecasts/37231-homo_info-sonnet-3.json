    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument with specific recent data: 2.2% unemployment in March 2025, down from 2.5% in February. If accurate, this dramatically changes the analysis - a jump from 2.2% to 3%+ in one month would require an unprecedented 0.8 percentage point increase. This is far more buffer than I initially assumed. Forecaster 3 and I converged on 65% using similar reasoning about gradual labor market impacts, but we both seem to have been working with outdated baseline data (around 2.8%). The key insight is that we're past April 29th - the outcome has already occurred. The question is purely about what the data will show, not what will happen. If March unemployment was indeed in the 2.2-2.5% range as Forecaster 2 claims, and there have been no reports of major April layoffs (which there haven't been), then the status quo strongly favors remaining below 3%. However, I cannot independently verify Forecaster 2's March 2025 figures, which creates some residual uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I believe I underweighted the importance of recent trends and overweighted the theoretical tariff impacts. Forecaster 2's claim of 2.2% unemployment in March 2025 - if accurate - provides substantial buffer for April to remain below 3%. Even if that number is slightly off and March was closer to 2.4-2.6%, we would still need an unusually large month-over-month jump. Unemployment rates are sticky and change gradually absent major shocks. We're at April 29th with no reports of massive manufacturing layoffs or economic crisis in April. While US tariff concerns are real, Forecaster 3 correctly notes these effects typically manifest over 3-6 months, not immediately. The tariff article references future concerns, not April layoffs that have already occurred. The convergence between Forecaster 3 and myself at 65% now seems too conservative given the likely March baseline. However, I remain more cautious than Forecaster 2's 93% because: (1) I cannot independently verify the March data, (2) the margin to 3% is still relatively narrow even from 2.2%, and (3) there's always uncertainty around preliminary statistics and potential data revisions. I'm updating significantly upward but maintaining some uncertainty.",
