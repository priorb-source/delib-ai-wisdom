  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.\n\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. The inflation data for April 2025 will be officially released and reported in early to mid-May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current strong upward trend in inflation, which accelerated from 12.9% in January to 14.6% in March, suggests that without a significant change, the rate will surpass 15.0% in April.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflationary pressures unexpectedly cool in April. This could be driven by the National Bank's tight monetary policy having a stronger-than-anticipated effect, a sharp contraction in consumer demand, or an early start to seasonal disinflation in food prices. A significant deceleration in month-over-month price growth would be required to keep the annual rate below 15.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The inflationary momentum from the first quarter continues into April. Persistent factors such as high production costs, war-related supply chain disruptions, and the impact of recent attacks on energy infrastructure keep month-over-month inflation elevated, pushing the annual rate from 14.6% past the 15.0% threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong inflationary momentum observed in early 2025. The annual inflation rate has shown a clear accelerating trend, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. This leaves only a 0.4 percentage point gap to the 15.0% threshold. The high monthly inflation of 1.5% in March indicates that the underlying price pressures are significant and broad-based, as evidenced by large year-over-year increases in food (+17.4%) and housing/utilities (+20.2%). The primary drivers—the ongoing war, damage to energy infrastructure, and labor shortages—are persistent and unlikely to have abated in April.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there are notable countervailing factors. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is maintaining a tight monetary policy with a 15.5% key rate, which is designed to curb inflation. The NBU itself projects inflation will peak in the second quarter and then decline, suggesting the peak is near. Additionally, potential seasonal decreases in food prices and reduced consumer demand could exert some downward pressure.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower because these disinflationary forces are more likely to have a material impact later in the year. The immediate momentum and the severity of the supply-side shocks, particularly to energy, make a continued rise in the annual rate in April the most probable outcome. For the outcome to be 'No', there would need to be an abrupt and significant slowdown in monthly price growth, which seems unlikely given the current environment.\n\nI would increase my probability if there were reports of further significant damage to Ukraine's energy or port infrastructure in April. I would decrease my probability if early data (e.g., fuel price indices) for April showed a marked and unexpected deceleration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation.
