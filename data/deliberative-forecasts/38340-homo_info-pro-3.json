    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong and unanimous agreement, converging on a 1% probability. The core reasoning is identical: Sudan's ongoing civil war has paralyzed state functions, making legislative action like treaty ratification practically impossible within the extremely short timeframe. I found the other forecasters' arguments highly convincing as they reinforced my own analysis and introduced two new, salient points. Forecaster 2 raised the critical issue of Sudan's suspension from the African Union, which presents a major political and procedural obstacle to depositing the instrument of ratification. Forecaster 3 added useful context about the slow pace of AfCFTA ratification even in stable countries, further highlighting the unlikelihood of a rushed process in Sudan. These points strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 1% was based on the near-total paralysis of the Sudanese state due to the civil war that began in April 2023. With less than a month until the deadline, the possibility of achieving peace, forming a functional government, and completing the legislative process for ratification is infinitesimally small. The deliberation with my colleagues has only strengthened this conviction. Forecaster 2's point about Sudan's suspension from the African Union is particularly damning, as it adds a formal diplomatic and procedural barrier to the already overwhelming practical ones. It is difficult to see how a suspended member could successfully deposit an instrument of ratification with the AU Commission, the treaty's depositary. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's observation that ratification is a slow process even in peaceful, stable nations underscores the sheer implausibility of it happening under current conditions in Sudan. Given this overwhelming and now-reinforced evidence, I see no reason to change my forecast. The 1% probability remains as an appropriate accounting for a highly improbable 'black swan' event, such as a sudden, unexpected political settlement designed to garner international legitimacy, however unlikely that may be.",
