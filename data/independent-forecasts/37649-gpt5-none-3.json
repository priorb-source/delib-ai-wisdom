    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until end of June 30, 2025 local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink’s map continues to show Chad as Coming Soon (or not listed) through June 30, 2025 due to pending implementation steps—e.g., terminal type approvals, import/logistics, local partner setup, or final regulatory conditions—so the site never flips to “Available.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX updates the Starlink Availability Map in the next few weeks to enable service in Chad (even if limited or phased), the country tiles show “Available,” and orders open for at least some locations before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Context: Starlink reportedly secured a license to operate in Chad in Nov 2024. As of today (May 15, 2025), the resolution criteria have not been met, implying the map does not yet show Chad as “Available.”\n- Base rates/patterns: In many African markets, once licensing is obtained, Starlink often goes live within months, especially now that laser links reduce dependence on local gateways. However, timing varies widely due to type approval of hardware, customs/imports, distribution partners, taxation/USF arrangements, and occasional policy reversals. Small markets sometimes wait longer despite licensing because commercial prioritization is lower.\n- Time factor: Only ~1.5 months remain. If it hasn’t flipped by mid-May, that modestly favors the status quo (No) given common slippage in African rollouts and Starlink’s tendency to batch map updates.\n- Why not higher: Lack of evidence of imminent launch (no public rollout signals, and the map isn’t already live) and the potential for bureaucratic or logistical delay in Chad reduce the chance of a near-term flip.\n- Why not lower: A license is already in hand; technical constraints are minimal due to ISL; Starlink has been aggressively expanding African availability. A simple map update could occur any week if backend readiness and local compliance are completed.\n- What would move me up: Any credible statement from SpaceX/Starlink or the Chadian regulator that service activation is imminent; the availability map showing Chad with a “Q2 2025” target or opening preorders; evidence of terminal shipments clearing customs; local partners announcing sales.\n- What would move me down: Silence into late June; the map shifting Chad to “Q3 2025” or later; reports of regulatory disputes, import holdups, or government-imposed delays.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information beyond the licensing report; thus the forecast leans on general rollout patterns and the current non-availability status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
