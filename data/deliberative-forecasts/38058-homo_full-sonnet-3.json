    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 3's observation about the July 9 EU tariff deadline is particularly compelling - as this deadline approaches through June, coverage will likely intensify rather than diminish, making late June particularly unlikely for simultaneous omission. This temporal consideration suggests the probability isn't uniform across all 35 days. Forecaster 2's emphasis on news cycle unpredictability and the 'only one day needed' logic is valid, though perhaps slightly optimistic. Both correctly note that 'tariff burnout' reflects public sentiment rather than editorial judgment to reduce coverage of consequential policy. The distinction between public fatigue and editorial priorities is important - major economic stories with ongoing developments ($830/household impact, 350K jobs) don't disappear just because audiences are tired of them. Forecaster 3's point about multiple 90-day pauses ending creates additional ongoing storylines. However, I find Forecaster 3's 12% perhaps too anchored to current high salience, insufficiently accounting for the genuine unpredictability over 35 days. Forecaster 2's 20% may slightly overweight the 'anything can happen' factor.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the arguments, I'm updating slightly downward from 15% to 13%. The key insight from Forecaster 3 that swayed me is the temporal dimension: the July 9 EU deadline means late June (still within the resolution window) will likely see intensive negotiation coverage, reducing the probability of simultaneous omission as we approach that date. Additionally, the convergence of multiple policy deadlines (EU negotiations, 90-day pause expirations) makes sustained front-page coverage more likely than I initially weighted. However, I'm not going as low as 12% because 35 days genuinely provides substantial opportunities, and news cycles have demonstrated unpredictability even with ongoing major stories. Major breaking events (international incidents, Supreme Court decisions, natural disasters, etc.) could temporarily dominate both front pages. The probability isn't zero that we hit a brief lull in tariff developments in early-to-mid June before the July 9 deadline pressure intensifies. My 13% forecast reflects stronger weight on the deadline proximity argument while maintaining recognition that over 35 days, at least one aberrant news day remains plausible.",
