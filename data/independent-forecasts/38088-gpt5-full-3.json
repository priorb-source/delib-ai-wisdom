  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.\n\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current #250 is not from the United States (Vladimir Potanin, Russia)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rank ~250 continues to be occupied by a non-U.S. billionaire (e.g., Potanin or another non-U.S. name) as non-U.S. representation remains higher in the 200–300 range and day-to-day moves don’t elevate a U.S. billionaire into exactly #250 on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A U.S. billionaire currently hovering near ranks ~248–255 edges into exactly #250 on July 1, helped by a late-June U.S. market uptick and/or USD strength relative to other currencies.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: In the 200–300 band, about 62% of positions are non-U.S., implying roughly a 38% chance that any given snapshot at #250 is U.S. The research assistant also notes U.S. share in the top 500 declining from ~40% to ~35% over the past year, nudging the baseline a bit lower.\n- Status quo: The #250 slot was non-U.S. on Apr 30 (Giancarlo Devasini, Italy) and is non-U.S. on May 29 (Vladimir Potanin, Russia). This supports a modest tilt toward No, given we’re only ~1 month out and the immediate evidence points non-U.S.\n- Seasonality/context: If there is mild Q1–Q2 weakness in U.S. representation, July 1 sits right on the cusp of that period, slightly favoring a non-U.S. outcome.\n- Volatility considerations: The #250 spot can change frequently with daily moves in equities, commodities, and FX. U.S. equity strength into late May could help nearby U.S. billionaires, but similar forces can buoy non-U.S. fortunes too. With only a month to go, this looks like a coin flip weighted by the cross-sectional base rate rather than a strong directional call.\nWhy not higher: The base rate around this rank is below 40% for U.S., the recent trend in U.S. share is down, and current occupant is non-U.S.\nWhy not lower: Day-to-day volatility is meaningful; a single strong U.S. session or USD strength could easily put a U.S. billionaire at exactly #250 on the snapshot date. Also, U.S. equities have been relatively resilient.\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that multiple U.S. billionaires are clustered around ranks 248–252 in late June; a notable late-June U.S. market rally; USD appreciation versus major currencies; Bloomberg methodology changes favoring U.S.-listed assets.\nWhat would move me down: A continued non-U.S. cluster around 248–252; commodity/EM equity rallies or USD weakness that lift non-U.S. fortunes; further declines in U.S. representation around the 200–300 band.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
