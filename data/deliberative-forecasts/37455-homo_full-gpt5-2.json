    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my take: the key regulatory hurdle (license) is cleared, Starlink has recently demonstrated very fast post‑license activations (notably DRC), and geofencing plus ISL lowers technical barriers. New or sharpened points I found useful: (1) Lesotho’s supply chain reliance on South Africa could complicate imports/logistics even if the map could flip; (2) the criterion is modest—only the map needs to show Available—but Starlink typically flips the map when orders and shipping are ready; (3) expectation of batch updates across newly licensed African markets in the coming weeks. I agree with their upside and downside catalysts. I still weigh the enclave-within‑South‑Africa issue, type approval, payments/tax setup, and a small market’s prioritization risk as meaningful drags, but the DRC precedent and time remaining are compelling.",
    "rationale": "I slightly raise my probability. The peers reinforced the strong recent base rate: in some African markets SpaceX has gone license→Available within days, and we still have ~7–8 weeks left. While I continue to see plausible blockers (type approval, import/logistics via South Africa, local billing/tax compliance, and heightened caution about spillover into unlicensed SA), none are certain or clearly binding. Given Starlink’s apparent 2025 acceleration and that only a map flip is required, I think the balance nudges higher than my initial 58%. I’m not as high as 66–68% due to the lack of any public launch teasers since Apr 14 and the unique enclave/regional enforcement sensitivity, which could push activation into July or later if any administrative step lags. Net: modest upward adjustment.",
