    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months, from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia does not invade any country other than Ukraine, and the US does not make such an accusation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues its military operations exclusively in Ukraine and its currently occupied territories. Despite ongoing tensions with neighboring countries, Russia does not send ground forces into any other country without consent. The US therefore has no basis to accuse Russia of additional invasions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia escalates by sending ground forces into another country, most plausibly Moldova (particularly the Transnistria region where Russian forces are already present) or potentially Georgia (expanding beyond existing occupied territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia). The US government promptly and publicly accuses Russia of invasion.",
    "rationale": "The probability of this occurring within the next 2 months is very low for several key reasons. First, Russia is heavily committed to its ongoing war in Ukraine, which has stretched Russian military resources, manpower, and equipment thin. Opening a second major front would be strategically risky and logistically challenging. Second, the timeframe is extremely short - only 2 months - and major military invasions typically require substantial buildup and preparation that would likely be detected. Third, most plausible targets have significant deterrents: Baltic states are NATO members (invasion would trigger Article 5), Belarus is already a close ally, and Georgia/Moldova invasions would face international consequences while Russia is already isolated. Fourth, historical base rates show Russia's major invasions (Georgia 2008, Crimea 2014, Ukraine 2022) were years apart, not months. The research assistant provided no information suggesting imminent invasion plans or unusual military movements toward other countries. My forecast is not higher because there remains a small tail risk - Russia could make an unexpected move in Transnistria or accelerate plans if it sees strategic opportunity or faces desperation in Ukraine. It's not lower because geopolitical surprises do occasionally happen, and 2 months is enough time for a rapid escalation if circumstances change dramatically. I would update higher if I saw: significant Russian troop movements toward borders of other countries, explicit Russian threats or ultimatums to neighboring states, or major shifts in the Ukraine war creating strategic imperatives. I would update lower with evidence of continued Russian focus solely on Ukraine and no provocative actions elsewhere.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
