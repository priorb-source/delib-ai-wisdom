  "information": "Following Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome is effectively already known. UFC 316 has not yet occurred, but the conditions for the question have been altered.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The scheduled fight between Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 has been cancelled.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "As has been reported, Johnny Walker withdraws from the fight. He does not fight Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316, causing the question to resolve as 'No' according to the specified criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a highly improbable turn of events, the new opponent Brendson Ribeiro withdraws from UFC 316, and Johnny Walker is re-booked to fight Azamat Murzakanov at the same event. Walker must then go on to win this reinstated bout.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based directly on the resolution criteria and the research provided. The question resolves as 'Yes' only if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The critical information from my research assistant indicates that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from this fight. Multiple outlets have confirmed that Azamat Murzakanov will now face a new opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, at the event. The status quo is that the original fight is cancelled. The resolution criteria explicitly state: 'If Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.' Since Walker is no longer scheduled to fight Murzakanov at this event, the condition for a 'No' resolution has been met. My forecast is 0 because the premise of the question is no longer valid. For my forecast to be higher, official news would need to break that the Ribeiro fight is off and the original Walker vs. Murzakanov fight has been reinstated for UFC 316. Without such a drastic reversal, a 'Yes' outcome is impossible.",
