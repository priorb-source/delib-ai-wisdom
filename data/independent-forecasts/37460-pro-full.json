  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. A protest meeting the size criteria has already occurred within the question's timeframe, and the high-tension political and economic environment makes further protests likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions in Turkey unexpectedly de-escalate, preventing further large demonstrations. Concurrently, the Global Protest Tracker has a significant reporting lag and fails to add the large-scale May 1st protest to its database before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker updates its database to include the May 1, 2025 Labor Day protests in Istanbul, where authorities reported 65,000 participants. This single event would satisfy the resolution criteria. Alternatively, another protest over 10,000 participants occurs before the deadline and is subsequently reported by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "My high confidence in a 'Yes' outcome is anchored in events that have already transpired. The research brief states that on May 1, 2025, authorized marches in Istanbul had a combined participation of approximately 65,000 people. This event occurred after the question's start date and surpasses the 10,000-participant threshold. Therefore, the resolution of this question depends almost entirely on a single factor: whether the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker will log this widely reported event before July 1, 2025. Given that logging significant global protests is the explicit purpose of the tracker, and the nearly two-month window available for this update, it is highly probable that it will be recorded in time. Furthermore, the underlying drivers of protest—including the arrest of a major opposition mayor, upcoming trials for protestors, broader human rights concerns, and a high inflation rate of nearly 50%—remain potent. These factors create a high likelihood of additional large-scale protests occurring before the deadline, providing further potential triggers for a 'Yes' resolution. My forecast is not higher than 92% to account for the small but real possibility of a bureaucratic or methodological delay in the tracker's updating process, which is the primary source of uncertainty. My forecast is not lower because that would require betting against both the timely reporting of a major event that has already happened and the strong likelihood of future events in a volatile environment. I would update my forecast higher upon confirmation of the tracker's update schedule or seeing the May 1st event added. I would update lower only if explicit information surfaces that the tracker's next update is scheduled for after July 1, 2025.",
