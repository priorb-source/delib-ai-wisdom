  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "24 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The agreement remains legally in effect, but Bulgargaz is in breach of contract by not making payments. Negotiations between Bulgaria and Turkey on modifying the agreement are ongoing.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes with the agreement still technically in force. Both parties continue complex negotiations to restructure the terms and address the outstanding debt, choosing to avoid the legal and financial chaos of an abrupt cancellation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing extreme financial pressure and public outcry over the mounting debt, the Bulgarian government makes a unilateral public announcement that it is cancelling the agreement to stop future liabilities from accruing, intending to deal with the existing debt and legal repercussions in international arbitration.",
    "rationale": "The probability of cancellation is low primarily due to the massive outstanding debt of approximately €2 billion that Bulgaria owes BOTAŞ. This debt acts as a powerful anchor preventing a clean break. As a former Bulgarian minister noted, termination is likely blocked until the debt is settled. A unilateral cancellation by Bulgaria would trigger a costly international arbitration case that it would be very likely to lose regarding the accrued debt. The status quo, as of a month ago, involves negotiations focused on price and capacity renegotiation, not outright cancellation. This indicates that both sides are still exploring a path to modify the deal rather than scrap it. Turkey has publicly opposed cancellation, and with Bulgaria in significant debt, Turkey holds the stronger negotiating position. Finally, with only 24 days remaining, it is highly improbable that such a complex international agreement would be formally cancelled, a process that would typically follow lengthy and conclusive negotiations. The probability is not lower than 15% because the financial situation for Bulgargaz is described as critical ('on verge of bankruptcy'), and the daily cost is substantial. This creates immense domestic political pressure on the Bulgarian government, which could lead to a desperate, politically-motivated decision to cancel unilaterally despite the legal consequences. I would increase the probability if high-level talks were reported to have collapsed completely. I would decrease it if any joint statement about progress on renegotiating terms were to be released.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
