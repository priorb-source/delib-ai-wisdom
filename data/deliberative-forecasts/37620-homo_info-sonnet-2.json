    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that significantly challenge my initial forecast. Forecaster 3's historical pattern evidence is particularly crucial: Kadyrov made virtually identical statements about stepping down in 2016, 2020, and 2022 with zero follow-through. This is powerful base rate information I completely missed. Forecaster 2's point about the May 7 Putin meeting - just ONE DAY after Kadyrov's May 6 statement - where Putin praised him with language suggesting continuity is also critical context. Both forecasters also note May 12 comments (today) where Kadyrov discusses current operations rather than departure. These forecasters correctly frame this as likely political theater or a loyalty test, which is consistent with Russian political culture. I overweighted the health concerns and succession planning without properly considering they could be long-term preparations rather than immediate transitions. I also failed to account for the strong base rate of similar statements producing no action.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I need to significantly update downward. The key factors that change my assessment: (1) The historical pattern of three previous similar statements with zero follow-through establishes a strong base rate suggesting this is political theater; (2) The May 7 Putin meeting just one day after the statement, with Putin praising Kadyrov and expressing support, strongly indicates no immediate transition is planned; (3) Kadyrov's May 12 comments discussing current operations suggest business as usual rather than departure; (4) The 20-day timeframe remains extremely compressed for such a major transition. However, I don't go as low as 5% because there remains some tail risk from genuine health emergencies or unforeseen political circumstances, and the succession planning activities suggest this is at least being contemplated for the future. The evidence now strongly points to this being a loyalty demonstration or political positioning rather than a genuine imminent resignation.",
