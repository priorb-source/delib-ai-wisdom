  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Days to 2 weeks - we are at April 29, 2025, and April 2025 unemployment data is typically released by national statistics agencies within 2-3 weeks after month end",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - unemployment stays under 3%. Mexico's most recent unemployment rate was 2.2% in March 2025, a historic low and well below the 3% threshold. The trend has been declining from 2.5% in February 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariffs on Mexican products (25% on autos, steel, plastics) cause immediate and severe job losses in April 2025, particularly in manufacturing and automotive supply chains. Companies respond to tariff impacts with rapid layoffs, causing unemployment to spike from 2.2% to 3.0% or above within a single month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's unemployment remains at or near the March 2025 level of 2.2% through April. Economic conditions remain relatively stable, tariff impacts take time to materialize in employment data, and Mexico's Plan México initiatives help maintain labor market strength. Unemployment stays well under the 3% threshold.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo given the extremely strong recent data. March 2025 unemployment was 2.2%, down from 2.3% a year prior and 2.5% in February 2025. The key factor is that we're already at April 29, 2025 - the outcome has essentially already occurred, we're just awaiting the data release. Unemployment rates rarely jump dramatically month-to-month absent major economic shocks. While US tariffs on Mexican products are concerning and the IMF projects unemployment rising to 3.8% 'during 2025', several factors support a sub-3% April reading: (1) tariff impacts on employment typically manifest over months, not weeks, as companies first reduce hours, freeze hiring, or delay investment before layoffs; (2) the IMF's projection is for the full year, not specifically April; (3) Mexico's government is implementing countermeasures; (4) the large informal sector (54.4%) provides some labor market flexibility. For unemployment to reach 3% in April would require an unprecedented 0.8 percentage point increase in one month - highly unlikely without massive, immediate layoffs. My forecast is not higher (closer to certainty) because tariff announcements could theoretically have caused some immediate employment effects, and there's inherent measurement uncertainty. It's not lower because the March data point is very strong and we're essentially forecasting already-determined data. I would update higher only with evidence of major April layoff announcements; lower updates are unlikely given my already high confidence.",
