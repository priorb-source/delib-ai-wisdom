    "review": "Both forecasters use the same base-rate framing I did: a Poisson approximation keyed to the post‑2020 Africa coup wave, with Latin America contributing a small tail risk. They converge on ~22–25%, which is consistent with my earlier 24%. New arguments were limited: Forecaster 3 explicitly notes we are already several months into 2025 without a successful coup, modestly suggesting a lower current hazard than 2020–2023; Forecaster 2 emphasizes persistent Sahel drivers. I find their reasoning broadly convincing and methodologically sound. I’m less convinced by Forecaster 3’s implied 3–5% add from Latin America for a successful coup within ~2 months; I’d cap that at ~1–2% given recent failures and institutional resilience. Neither provided specific near‑term triggers or country signals that would materially move the needle upward. Overall, their analyses slightly reinforce a modest downward tilt versus a pure 2020–2023 base rate.",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on a Poisson base rate with a tempered Africa hazard given the 2024–2025 cooling (several attempts, no clear successes). Using t ≈ 67 days (~0.184 years): Africa λ_A ≈ 1.3–1.5/year → m_A ≈ 0.24–0.28; Latin America λ_L ≈ 0.05–0.1/year → m_L ≈ 0.01–0.02. Combined m ≈ 0.25–0.30 → P(≥1) = 1 − e^(−m) ≈ 22–26%. Given the absence of fresh warning indicators in key hotspots (Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea‑Bissau, DRC) and the higher consolidation of existing juntas, I lean toward the lower half of that band. I’m nudging my estimate down 1 pp from 24% to 23% to reflect the deliberators’ emphasis on the short window and 2025’s relative calm, while still accounting for ongoing coup‑prone conditions in parts of the Sahel. Triggers that would move me up quickly include credible reports of elite fissures, abrupt command reshuffles, or troop movements in capitals; sustained quiet or visible regime consolidation would push me lower.",
