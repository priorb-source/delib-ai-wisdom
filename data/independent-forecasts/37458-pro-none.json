    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days. The outcome will be known on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that heads of state communicate with their official counterparts. As a private citizen and political candidate, Donald Trump is not Xi Jinping's counterpart, and they do not have routine phone calls. Normal diplomatic protocols will be followed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Standard diplomatic protocols are maintained. The Chinese government sees no strategic benefit, and significant diplomatic risk, in holding a publicly acknowledged phone call with a US presidential candidate, as it would antagonize the current administration. The one-month period passes without any specific crisis or event that would compel such an unusual communication.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant international crisis erupts, for instance in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Trump to make major public statements. The Xi administration decides a direct, acknowledged call is strategically useful to gauge the intentions of a potential future US president and to signal to the current administration. Both sides agree to a carefully choreographed and publicly announced conversation to manage the crisis narrative.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong influence of established diplomatic norms. The base rate for a private citizen, even a prominent presidential candidate, holding a publicly acknowledged phone call with the head of state of a major power like China is exceptionally low. Such an act would be a departure from protocol and could create diplomatic friction with the incumbent Biden administration, a risk the typically cautious Chinese government is unlikely to take for minimal gain.\n\nThe key constraint is that both sides must acknowledge the call. The provided background information from CBS News, where China denied Trump's previous claims about talks, highlights Beijing's reluctance to be drawn into Trump's unconventional public diplomacy. This reinforces the high probability that even if back-channel communication occurred, China would not publicly acknowledge it.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because Donald Trump's political style is famously unconventional, and he may seek such a call for campaign purposes to project an image of being a global dealmaker. There remains a small but non-zero chance that a specific, acute geopolitical event could create a narrow window of perceived mutual interest for a public call.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the structural barriers are immense. For a 'Yes' outcome, President Xi would have to decide that the benefits of speaking to a non-office-holder outweigh the certain diplomatic fallout with the current US government. Given the short timeframe and the high bar for joint public confirmation, this remains a very unlikely event.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of high-level emissaries from both sides actively trying to arrange such a call. I would decrease it further if the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement explicitly ruling out communications with non-governmental candidates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
