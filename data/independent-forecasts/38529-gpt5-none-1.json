    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–4 weeks (primary is June 24, 2025; presumptive nominee likely called within ~1–2 weeks after RCV/absentee counting).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo narrowly wins the Democratic primary and is called the presumptive nominee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Progressives consolidate behind Zohran Mamdani; anti-Cuomo sentiment depresses his RCV transfers, and Mamdani overtakes him in later rounds. Alternatively, a late-breaking negative story or key endorsements against Cuomo swing late-deciders and second-choice flows away from him.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo’s name recognition and moderate/base support keep him first on first-choice ballots; moderate voters consolidate sufficiently, he avoids a severe RCV penalty, and he’s called the presumptive nominee after the tabulation.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the available signal (linked poll headline) indicates Cuomo is leading, albeit with a narrowing margin. With only ~2 weeks to go, the base-rate for late leaders in low-turnout, older, moderate-leaning NYC Democratic mayoral primaries is favorable, especially for a candidate with very high name recognition and fundraising capacity. Ranked-choice voting is the main structural risk: a polarizing candidate can lead on first choices yet lose on transfers if opposition consolidates. The headline also signals Mamdani’s momentum, which raises the probability of an RCV flip if progressive and anti-Cuomo voters coordinate. Endorsements and organizational muscle (unions, clubs, machines) typically matter; Cuomo may struggle to secure broad elite backing due to past controversies, which caps his ceiling. On the other hand, a fragmented field or a weak/incumbent-moderate presence would help Cuomo by splitting his rivals and limiting coordinated anti-Cuomo transfers. I place extra weight on the status quo (current leader tends to hold) but discount for RCV vulnerability and late movement. Research assistant provided no additional info; thus, I’m anchoring on the cited polling advantage and generic priors about NYC Democratic primaries and RCV dynamics. Why not higher? Narrowing polls, likely poor second-choice appeal, and potential for late consolidation against a polarizing figure. Why not lower? He appears to be the current leader with superior name ID in an electorate that often favors moderates; limited time remains for a full realignment. Upward update triggers: multiple high-quality polls showing Cuomo’s lead widening; evidence of moderate-lane consolidation and/or endorsements for Cuomo; RCV simulations showing acceptable second-choice inflows. Downward update triggers: credible polls putting Mamdani ahead or tied with better favorables/second-choice strength; major endorsements and organizational alignment behind a single Cuomo alternative; new negative developments reducing Cuomo’s acceptability or turnout among his base.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Andrew Cuomo is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City after the primary is held on June 24, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIf by the end of this tournament's scoring no presumptive nominee has been called (for example because there are not yet conclusive results from the vote counting), this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
