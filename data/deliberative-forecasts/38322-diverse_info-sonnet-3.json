    "review": "The other forecasters provided crucial information I lacked. Most critically, Forecaster 3 revealed that the May final reading was 52.2—already BELOW the 54.0 threshold. This fundamentally reframes the question from 'Will sentiment crash to crisis levels?' to 'Will sentiment improve by at least 1.8 points from its current depressed state?' This is a much different analytical challenge. Forecaster 2 adds important specifics: 7.3% year-ahead inflation expectations and three-quarters of consumers citing tariff concerns. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of timing (June 12 CPI release), preliminary vs. final dynamics, and concrete data points (ISM under 50, Conference Board at 98) provides valuable context. Both correctly identify that the status quo—staying near 52.2—favors a Yes outcome, but recognize plausible catalysts (cooling CPI, gas prices, jobs data) that could push sentiment above 54.0.",
    "rationale": "My initial 40% forecast was significantly too low because I misunderstood the baseline. With the May final at 52.2, the question becomes: Will June final remain below 54.0 or rise above it? The evidence strongly suggests continued weakness is more probable than improvement: (1) Persistent headwinds—tariff uncertainty affecting 75% of consumers, 7.3% inflation expectations, weak ISM readings (49.9 services, 48.5 manufacturing), elevated savings rates, and minimal spending growth—create a negative backdrop; (2) The status quo at 52.2 already resolves as Yes; (3) Historical patterns show sentiment doesn't reverse sharply without major positive catalysts. However, I'm not going higher than 63% because: (1) Only 1.8 points of improvement is needed—well within normal monthly volatility of 2-4 points; (2) Several near-term catalysts exist (June 12 CPI release, potential gas price moderation, upcoming jobs report); (3) The Conference Board's rebound to 98 suggests some consumer resilience; (4) After sharp declines, mean reversion is common. The preliminary reading mid-June will be highly informative—if it's above 55, No becomes likely; if below 53, Yes becomes very likely.",
