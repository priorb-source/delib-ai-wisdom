    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Around 10–14 days (election expected 1 May 2025; results likely overnight or by 2–3 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party on West Northamptonshire Council (they currently hold the most seats and run the authority following a large 2021 win).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong anti-Conservative swing sees Labour sweep many or most Northampton town wards, while Liberal Democrats, Greens and Independents pick off seats in Daventry and South Northamptonshire; Conservatives fall to second place (or end up tied for most seats).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives lose ground but still return the highest number of councillors, with opposition gains split among Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Independents. They may fall short of a majority but remain the largest party.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: We’ll know the outcome within roughly two weeks.\n- Baseline: In the inaugural 2021 unitary election, the Conservatives won a large majority (roughly two‑thirds of seats) and have been the largest party since. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to this status quo, because local seat maps and incumbency advantages tend to change more slowly than national polling swings.\n- Structure of the contest: West Northamptonshire combines strongly Conservative rural/suburban areas (Daventry, South Northants) with a more Labour-leaning urban core (Northampton). All-out, multi-member wards can amplify vote-splitting effects. Even with a national environment hostile to the Conservatives, opposition gains are likely to be distributed across Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and some Independents, which often leaves the Conservatives as the single largest party even when they lose overall control.\n- National environment: Current UK polling strongly favors Labour, and Reform UK’s presence risks splitting the right-of-centre vote in some wards. This makes significant Conservative seat losses plausible, especially in Northampton town. However, flipping the largest-party status council-wide requires Labour not just to dominate the town but also to avoid heavy fragmentation and to make additional inroads beyond the urban core—nontrivial given historic Conservative strength outside Northampton.\n- By comparison to similar councils that went NOC in recent cycles, Conservatives frequently remained the largest party while losing majorities; becoming second often required a very concentrated and coordinated opposition surge. That could happen here, but it’s not my base case.\n- Research assistant input: None (no additional information available), so this relies on structural factors, 2021 baseline, and national trends.\nWhy not higher? The national headwinds for the Conservatives are severe; Reform’s participation and energized opposition could flip many multi-member wards in Northampton and chip away elsewhere. A tie for most seats would also resolve as No.\nWhy not lower? The 2021 Conservative lead was large; rural/suburban wards still lean right; opposition vote is split among several parties; and all-out elections often reduce but don’t reverse the largest-party status in one cycle.\nWhat would move me up? Evidence of incomplete opposition slates, Reform standing in few wards, strong Conservative incumbency/canvass data in Northampton, or indications of limited Labour reach beyond the town.\nWhat would move me down? Local polling or credible canvass reports showing Labour poised to sweep Northampton plus gains in Daventry towns, widespread Reform candidacies splitting the right in rural areas, coordinated opposition targeting, or news of local Conservative-specific issues depressing their vote.",
