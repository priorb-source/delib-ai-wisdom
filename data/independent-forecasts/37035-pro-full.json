  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, as the outcome will be determined on or after June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The CDC Travel Health Notice for Colombia remains at Level 2, as the yellow fever outbreak does not escalate to meet the criteria for a higher-level warning.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains primarily contained within rural areas with low tourist traffic. Colombian public health measures, including the mass vaccination campaign, prove effective in controlling the spread. The CDC continues to view the risk as manageable for travelers through vaccination and mosquito precautions, maintaining the Level 2 notice consistent with its historical handling of larger outbreaks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The outbreak spreads rapidly from rural areas into major urban centers like Bogotá or Medellín, leading to sustained urban transmission. This escalation overwhelms the local healthcare system, and the CDC determines that the risk to travelers is no longer sufficiently mitigated by standard precautions, prompting a raise to Level 3 ('Avoid Nonessential Travel').",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on the historical precedent of the CDC's response to similar outbreaks. The most critical piece of information is that the CDC did not elevate its Travel Health Notice (THN) beyond Level 2 during much larger yellow fever outbreaks, such as in Brazil (2017-2018) which saw over 2,000 cases. The current outbreak in Colombia, with 79 confirmed cases, is significantly smaller in scale. The primary mitigating factor against a THN increase is that yellow fever is a vaccine-preventable disease. The current Level 2 notice already advises vaccination, which is the CDC's primary tool for risk mitigation in this context. A Level 3 or 4 notice is typically reserved for situations where risk cannot be easily mitigated (e.g., no vaccine available) or where an outbreak's characteristics fundamentally change, such as through sustained urban transmission or the collapse of the healthcare system. The current outbreak is concentrated in rural areas, not the major urban or tourist centers, and there is no evidence of a healthcare system collapse that would endanger travelers. Given the short timeframe of approximately five weeks until the resolution date, it is unlikely that the outbreak will escalate to a sufficient degree to cause the CDC to deviate from its established past practice. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the declaration of a national emergency by the Colombian government indicates the situation is serious, and there remains a small but non-zero probability of a rapid, unforeseen escalation, such as a large-scale transmission event in a major city. My forecast is not higher because the precedent is strong, the absolute number of cases is low compared to historical examples, a vaccine is available, and the outbreak is not currently occurring in a way that typically triggers a Level 3 warning from the CDC. I would raise my probability significantly upon receiving credible reports of sustained urban transmission in a major Colombian city.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
