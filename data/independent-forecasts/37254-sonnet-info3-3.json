  "information": "Russia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia does not invade another country and the US does not accuse them of doing so",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues its military operations exclusively in Ukraine, where its forces remain heavily committed. No new invasions occur, and the international situation remains stable through July 1, 2025. The US makes no new invasion accusations against Russia.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia invades or escalates military operations in a neighboring country such as Moldova (particularly around Transnistria where Russian forces are already present), re-invades Georgia, or takes opportunistic action in another weak neighbor. The US government quickly and publicly accuses Russia of this invasion within the 2-month window.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome for several compelling reasons. First, my research assistant reports that Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine with no significant troop buildups detected for operations elsewhere. This is crucial - Russia cannot easily open a new front while engaged in its costly Ukraine campaign. Second, the timeframe is extremely short at just 2 months, which limits the window for both new military buildups and execution of invasion operations. Third, historical base rates matter: invasions requiring ground forces are rare events that typically require months of preparation and observable military positioning. The US intelligence community and open-source analysts would likely detect major troop movements. The factors that prevent my forecast from being even lower include: (1) Russia already has military forces in some neighboring areas like Transnistria in Moldova, which could enable rapid escalation without major buildup, (2) unexpected geopolitical crises could emerge, and (3) the question only requires a US accusation, not necessarily a full-scale invasion on the scale of Ukraine. However, even these scenarios seem unlikely given Russia's stretched resources and the short timeframe. For me to significantly increase this forecast, I would need to see: credible intelligence reports of Russian military buildups near other borders, significant deterioration in relations with specific neighbors, or signs of internal instability in countries with Russian military presence. For me to decrease it further, I would need clear evidence that Russia is actually drawing down forces or facing such severe resource constraints that any new military action is impossible. Given the strong weight toward status quo and the short timeframe, I assess this probability at 4%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
