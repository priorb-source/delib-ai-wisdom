  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (as of 2025-05-05)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty drastically minimizes burn, negotiates with creditors, and/or secures a small bridge financing or asset-sale proceeds sufficient to keep the entity alive past July 1. They may pursue an out-of-court wind down (or state-level ABC) or continue to market the Ohio facility without filing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code until after the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cash is exhausted, payables or lease/contract claims mount, and the board files for Chapter 11 to pursue a 363 sale or for Chapter 7 to liquidate. Alternatively, a creditor files an involuntary petition. The filing happens before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Weighting the status quo: As of today there has been no filing despite months of severe distress. Companies often delay bankruptcy if they have minimal secured debt pressure and can stretch payables, which nudges the status quo toward No over a short horizon.\nKey facts from the research assistant that raise the Yes risk:\n- Cash fell from $9.2m (YE 2023) to $0.23m (YE 2024); management issued a going-concern warning and said liquidity is insufficient to continue operations.\n- Operations ceased and remaining fish stock was culled; operating inflows have effectively stopped; staff were largely laid off.\n- Capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year; GAAP losses remain very large; market cap ~ $2.2m and shares under $1, risking delisting.\nFactors tempering the immediate bankruptcy risk:\n- Reported debt-to-equity of 0.05 suggests limited secured debt and potentially less immediate creditor pressure, enabling delay without a filing.\n- The company survived into May without a filing despite YE 2024 cash near zero, implying some combination of additional small liquidity, payment deferrals, or aggressive cost cuts. That reduces odds of a filing within the next ~8 weeks.\n- An asset sale (e.g., the Ohio facility) or a tiny bridge/convertible raise could extend runway past July even if long-term viability remains doubtful.\nWhy not higher: If bankruptcy were unavoidable in the very near term, it likely would have occurred already given YE cash of $0.23m and no operations. The low leverage gives AquaBounty room to delay a formal filing, and even microcapital bridge financing or an out-of-court wind down could push any filing past July 1.\nWhy not lower: The company states it lacks sufficient liquidity, has halted revenue-generating activities, and has struggled to raise capital for over a year. With only weeks left, any hiccup in negotiations or a creditor action could trigger a Chapter 11/7 filing quickly; the resolution depends only on a filing, not on court approval.\nWhat would move me up:\n- 8-Ks or press noting imminent liquidity shortfalls, default notices, lease/contract termination disputes, missed payroll/tax obligations, or engagement of restructuring advisors/DIP lenders.\n- Failure of ongoing asset-sale talks, or litigation/creditor actions that would benefit from an automatic stay.\nWhat would move me down:\n- Announced bridge financing, government grant/refund, or definitive asset-sale agreement with near-term closing and cash proceeds.\n- Disclosure of materially reduced cash burn and successful creditor forbearance or negotiated exits from leases/contracts.\nNetting these, I put substantial weight on the short time window and the company’s apparent ability to delay, but the extremity of the liquidity situation keeps the probability elevated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
