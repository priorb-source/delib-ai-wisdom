  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, 16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current rate of objective completion, if maintained, will lead to the threshold being surpassed well before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rate of objective completion decelerates significantly. This could be due to the remaining objectives being more complex and controversial, facing successful legal challenges, or the administration's focus being diverted by other domestic or international crises. As a result, fewer than 15 new objectives are marked 'Done' by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains its recent pace of implementing Project 2025 goals. At least 15 of the 44 objectives already 'in progress' are completed, alongside others, pushing the total number of 'Done' objectives comfortably past the 120 mark before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent trend data for the Project 2025 Tracker. As of April 16, 2025, 105 objectives were classified as 'Done'. This followed a report of 100 'Done' objectives on April 8. This indicates a completion rate of 5 objectives over 8 days, or approximately 0.625 objectives per day. To reach the threshold of 120, a further 15 objectives must be completed. At the observed rate, this would take approximately 24 days (15 / 0.625), suggesting the threshold would be met around May 10, 2025, well in advance of the July 1 deadline. Extrapolating this rate through the full 76-day period from April 16 to July 1 would result in a total of over 150 completed objectives, providing a very large buffer. The existence of 44 objectives already 'in progress' provides a clear pipeline for future completions. My forecast is not higher than 92% because the rate is calculated from a short time window and may not be sustainable; progress often follows an S-curve, potentially slowing as easier objectives are completed. Additionally, unforeseen political events, legal hurdles, or changes in the volunteer-run tracker's methodology could impede progress. My forecast is not lower because the required rate to meet the goal (15 objectives in 76 days, or ~0.2 objectives/day) is less than one-third of the recently observed rate. A slowdown would have to be exceptionally sharp and immediate to cause a 'No' outcome. I would raise my forecast if new reports in June confirm the total has already surpassed 120. I would lower it if there is evidence of a significant policy-making stall or major legal defeats for the administration's executive actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
