    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two salient negatives: the very short runway before July 1 and February’s removal of a proof-of-citizenship provision from the transportation budget by Republicans themselves. They also cite DeWine’s hesitation as a brake. None of this is new factually, but Forecaster 2’s point that the budget-strip is a strong revealed-preference signal of intra-caucus caution is well taken. I’m less convinced by weighting a potential veto heavily because, per this market’s definition, enactment resolves at bicameral passage, not gubernatorial signature—but I agree a governor’s stance can still slow leadership. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on status-quo inertia and the need for clear committee movement is also persuasive. Net, their arguments marginally strengthen the case that my prior was a touch high given recent legislative behavior and the time left.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: GOP supermajorities and an introduced vehicle create a plausible path, and leadership could move a bill quickly if prioritized, potentially via an elections omnibus. Salience around noncitizen voter narratives and the SOS’s report keep political incentives aligned for action. Against that, the February decision to strip citizenship-proof language from a must-pass bill is a concrete, recent indicator of internal hesitation and/or legal-risk avoidance (NVRA preemption/dual-system complications). As of early May, there’s no visible fast-track progress; with fewer than two months left, status-quo inertia looms large. While the governor’s hesitation doesn’t directly block resolution under this question’s enactment definition, it likely depresses leadership urgency. Given peers’ emphasis on the revealed-preference signal from the budget episode and the compressed calendar, I’m trimming my estimate modestly. I would move up on signs of prioritization: scheduled committee hearings, rapid committee passage, or floor placement in either chamber; I would move down on leadership statements punting to later in the year or further signs that citizenship language is being stripped from live vehicles.",
