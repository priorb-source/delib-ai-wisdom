    "review": "The other forecasters present a cohesive and compelling argument centered on the strength of the status quo. Their core point, which I found highly persuasive, is that Glastonbury's failure to remove Kneecap from the lineup during the peak of the media controversy in late April and early May is a strong signal of their intent to retain the booking. My initial analysis focused heavily on the severity of the allegations, perhaps underestimating the festival's demonstrated tolerance for controversy and the power of institutional inertia this close to the event. Forecaster 2's framing that a 'new development' would be required to change the outcome is a particularly useful heuristic that I had not fully considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast significantly. Their emphasis on the importance of the status quo and the signal sent by Glastonbury's organisers' inaction is a critical piece of evidence that I previously underweighted. The fact that the initial, intense wave of political and media pressure did not result in a cancellation suggests the organisers have already considered the risks and made a decision to proceed. This fundamentally changes the baseline assumption. The most likely outcome is now that the performance will go ahead.\n\nTherefore, I am increasing my forecast from 40% to 60%. This 20-point increase reflects a shift from believing a cancellation was more likely than not, to believing the performance is the more probable outcome. \n\nHowever, I am not moving my forecast as high as the 68-75% range of the other forecasters. I maintain that the specific nature of the allegations — potential support for proscribed terrorist organisations in the UK, leading to an active police investigation — represents a qualitatively different and more severe risk than past Glastonbury controversies. This is not just a matter of political offense or bad taste; it carries tangible legal and security implications. The potential for the Metropolitan Police to advise against the performance on public order grounds, or for new information from their investigation to emerge, remains a substantial risk that I believe warrants a more cautious forecast. The 40% chance of a 'No' outcome reflects this unusually high level of precarity.",
