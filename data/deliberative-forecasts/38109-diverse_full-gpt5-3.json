    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial take: strong inertia and business incentives vs. a fragile “every day” requirement and a credible but uncertain legal/regulatory overhang. They didn’t introduce new factual evidence, but they emphasized two points worth underscoring: (1) the strict compounding nature of the requirement (a single miss = No), and (2) the timing ambiguity of a “quick” ruling. I agree that any Nevada-specific adverse outcome is more likely to be handled via geofencing than a platform-wide halt, which tempers the legal tail. Neither analysis considered explicitly the distinction between day-to-day independent outages and a common-mode legal/operational halt; that decomposition clarifies that most of the risk is common-mode rather than daily independent, slightly mitigating the compounding effect. Overall, I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "I still see the base case as continued daily MLB listings through June, supported by six-plus weeks of demonstrated operations and strong commercial incentives during peak season. MLB games occur essentially every day in June, so content supply isn’t the constraint. The main downside is a common-mode disruption (adverse court order or regulatory action) that prompts a temporary pause; secondarily, an operational miss (site outage, failure to list on a light-slate day). A Nevada ruling would likely be addressed via geofencing, not a nationwide halt, reducing the probability that such a ruling ruins the streak. Rough decomposition for June: common‑mode legal/reg risk ~10–15%; operational/other miss ~5–10%. Multiplying complements yields ~0.74–0.85, consistent with mid‑to‑high 70s. Given the strict “every day” criterion and the judge’s stated intent to move quickly, I’m keeping a cautious tilt. I’m nudging slightly toward the cohort’s 75% to reflect the fragility emphasized in their arguments, though my view hasn’t fundamentally changed. I’d move up with a quiet first half of June and/or signs the Nevada matter slips; down on any injunction/CFTC action or early‑June listing gaps.",
