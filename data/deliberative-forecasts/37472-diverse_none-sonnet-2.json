    "review": "The other forecasters provide strong, convergent reasoning that aligns closely with my own analysis. All three of us independently arrived at the 10-15% range, which suggests we've correctly identified the key constraints. Forecaster 2 makes excellent points about legal cases likely being prepared and India's interest in Bangladesh stability. Forecaster 3 effectively characterizes her public vows as 'cheap talk without logistics' and notes that high-profile returns cannot occur clandestinely. Both forecasters elaborate more thoroughly on the diplomatic and legal barriers than I did initially. However, neither introduces fundamentally new evidence or arguments that I hadn't considered in my original framework - they simply develop certain points more fully. The consensus is meaningful, and their elaboration on legal barriers and India's diplomatic calculus deserves weight. That said, no concrete new information about travel plans, negotiations, or policy shifts has emerged that would justify a significant update.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 10% to 12%. This reflects: (1) The meaningful consensus among three independent forecasters all landing in the 10-15% range, suggesting our shared framework is robust; (2) The stronger emphasis by others on legal barriers and India's geopolitical interests, which reinforces the status quo likelihood; (3) Recognition that while my original reasoning was sound, the elaboration by other forecasters on diplomatic constraints is compelling. However, I'm not moving to 15% because no fundamentally new evidence has been presented - the analysis is consistent across all three forecasters, just with varying levels of detail. The 12% forecast acknowledges tail risk scenarios (sudden political crisis, secret negotiations, health emergency) while reflecting that the 50-day window, combined with legal obstacles, security concerns, and diplomatic inertia, makes a return highly unlikely. I would update significantly upward only with concrete evidence of travel arrangements, legal guarantees, or India signaling a policy shift.",
