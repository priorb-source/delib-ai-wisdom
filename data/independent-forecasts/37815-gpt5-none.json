    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilot in South America reports a UFO/UAP to NUFORC for an incident dated June 2025, or such a report is not posted under NUFORC’s Pilot reports page by the time Metaculus checks after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one pilot (e.g., a commercial crew over Brazil, Chile, or Colombia) submits a June 2025 sighting to NUFORC and it appears on the NUFORC Pilot reports page with a South American country listed.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Pilot reports are a small subset of NUFORC reports and are disproportionately U.S.-centric. International (and especially South American) pilot reports appear only occasionally on NUFORC, likely due to language/reporting-channel frictions and lower awareness. The cited example of a Brazil pilot report in Dec 2024 demonstrates such reports do occur, but not frequently. For a single month and a specific region, the status quo (no qualifying report) is the most common outcome. Modeling loosely: if South America pilot reports average around 1–2 per year on NUFORC, the monthly chance is roughly 8–16% assuming a Poisson-like arrival and little seasonality. June isn’t clearly advantaged for South America (winter there; commercial ops steady year-round), and an additional requirement is that NUFORC posts it onto the dedicated Pilot index in time for when Metaculus checks after July 1. That posting/visibility criterion slightly lowers odds versus pure occurrence. Why not higher: pilot-category rarity, U.S.-centric reporting, language barriers, and posting-timing risk. Why not lower: multiple South American countries provide many potential opportunities; recent Dec 2024 Brazil pilot report indicates a live pipeline; global UAP attention continues to spur reporting. Updaters: I would increase the probability if NUFORC shows a higher recent cadence of international pilot postings or if there is media chatter in South America about a June 2025 airline/pilot UAP incident. I would decrease it if NUFORC’s Pilot page shows sparse updates lately or appears focused almost exclusively on U.S. cases, or if we learn NUFORC has long posting lags beyond July for June incidents. Research assistant provided no additional info; thus forecast rests on base rates, site behavior patterns, and plausibility reasoning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
