  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "8 days until the May 20, 2025 recall election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on historical data, approximately 60% of recall elections that reach the ballot result in removal of the official, suggesting a baseline 40% chance of Metz retaining his seat. However, given that ballots are already being returned in this active mail-in election, the effective status quo is that the recall process is underway with voting occurring now.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Metz loses the recall election and is removed from the town council. Voters in Mountain View are outraged by the shooting of an innocent teenager who was merely taking homecoming photos outside Metz's home. The egregious nature of the alleged crime - shooting a 17-year-old in the face when the Sheriff's office found no indication the teen intended any crime - proves too damaging for Metz to overcome. In the small town environment where virtually everyone knows about the incident, enough voters decide they cannot be represented by someone facing such serious felony charges.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Metz retains his seat by surviving the recall election. Either there are mitigating circumstances about the shooting not reflected in public reporting that local voters understand, or the small-town dynamics work in Metz's favor through personal relationships and loyalty. Some voters may adhere strongly to 'innocent until proven guilty' principles or oppose the recall process itself. Given fewer than 400 active voters, even a small core of supporters could be sufficient if turnout is uneven.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor a NO outcome (Metz losing): The allegations are extraordinarily serious - he allegedly shot an unarmed teenager in the face who was simply taking homecoming pictures. The Jefferson County Sheriff explicitly stated there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. This makes it very difficult to construct a justified self-defense narrative. Historical data shows 60% of recalls succeed, but this case involves circumstances far more damaging than typical policy disputes or corruption allegations. Recent Colorado recalls (Dillon, Loveland) have been successful, suggesting an active recall environment in the state. The fact that the recall petition was successfully certified indicates significant existing opposition. With only 500-600 residents, the incident is likely universally known in the community. However, I cannot assign an extremely low probability to Metz surviving because: There is no polling data available, leaving significant uncertainty. Small towns can have unpredictable dynamics where personal relationships trump allegations. We lack information about Metz's version of events or any potential mitigating circumstances. The 40% historical survival rate for recalls provides a meaningful baseline floor. To move my forecast higher, I would need: polling showing strong support for Metz, evidence of mitigating circumstances in the shooting, or signs that voters prioritize 'innocent until proven guilty.' To move lower, I would need: polling showing overwhelming opposition, additional damaging information, or evidence that even Metz's traditional supporters have abandoned him.",
