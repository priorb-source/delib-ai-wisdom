    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (BEA’s Third Estimate for Q1 2025 is expected late June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the advance estimate was -0.3% annualized; if unrevised in sign, the third estimate remains ≤0.0%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Revisions from additional March data, inventories, trade, and services spending are modest or negative, leaving Q1 real GDP still slightly negative (e.g., -0.5% to -0.1%). Inventory drawdowns and/or net exports remain a drag, and PCE/services revisions are not large enough to offset.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Upward revisions of roughly +0.4 percentage points or more from stronger-than-initially-estimated PCE (especially services), smaller inventory drag, and/or a narrower trade deficit push Q1 growth above 0.0% (e.g., from -0.3% to +0.1–0.3%).",
    "rationale": "Known: The advance estimate for Q1 2025 real GDP growth was -0.3% annualized. The question resolves Yes only if the Third Estimate is >0.0%. Historically, revisions from the advance to the third estimate are usually modest and roughly mean-zero. The typical advance-to-third absolute revision is on the order of ~0.3–0.5 percentage points. A flip from -0.3% to >0% therefore requires an upward revision of at least about +0.4 pp, which happens but is not common.  Key mechanics: The third estimate incorporates more complete March source data (trade, inventories, construction, services) and some methodological refinements. Given the weakness in the headline was reportedly concentrated in inventories/net exports while domestic demand was firmer, there is a plausible path to an upward revision. However, without concrete evidence from the second estimate and latest source data, the base-case is that revisions are not large enough to flip the sign.  Status-quo weighting: With the advance at -0.3% and no reliable indication that the second estimate turned positive, the most likely outcome remains a small negative or near-zero print, implying No.  Why not higher? Sign flips from slightly negative to positive within three releases do occur but are relatively infrequent; needing a ≥0.4 pp upward revision sets a nontrivial bar.  Why not lower? The distribution of revisions is roughly symmetric, and the composition (stronger final sales, weaker inventories) often biases later revisions slightly upward, which gives some chance of a flip.  What would move me up: (1) If the Second Estimate (late May) shows a materially smaller negative (e.g., -0.1%) or a positive reading; (2) March Quarterly Services Survey and trade/inventories indicating stronger PCE services and a smaller drag from inventories/net exports; (3) Notable upward revisions to PCE deflators that realign quantities favorably.  What would move me down: (1) Second Estimate pushing further negative; (2) March trade/inventory data confirming a bigger drag; (3) Revisions showing weaker PCE or equipment/structures investment.  Research assistant input: No additional info was provided, so this forecast leans on historical revision patterns and the advance estimate’s composition narrative.",
