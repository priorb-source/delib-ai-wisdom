    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (ceremony on May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No win",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "She is edged out in all three nominated categories by current category favorites (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs, Megan Moroney, or favored collaborations), resulting in zero awards.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "She converts one of her three nominations—most plausibly a collaboration/visual media/single-related category or an upset in a major category—into a win.",
    "rationale": "With three nominations, a neutral baseline (≈5 nominees per category) implies ~20% per-category chance; assuming independence, that would be ~49% to win at least one. However, outcomes are correlated across categories and recent ACM cycles have been dominated by a small set of heavy favorites (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton), which likely lowers her per-category chances below the equal-share baseline. Kelsea Ballerini is a strong, respected artist, but she has not been the consensus favorite in most recent ACM major categories. A reasonable adjustment puts her per-category odds closer to ~12–18%, yielding an at-least-one-win probability around 35–45%. I center at 40%. Status quo (no win) gets extra weight because most nominees lose in any given category and the current competitive landscape likely persists. The research assistant provided no new information, so this relies on base rates and recent award dynamics. Not higher: strong competitors and correlated underdog status across categories. Not lower: three independent shots still create substantial chance for at least one conversion, and industry respect plus possible collaborative/visual categories can break her way. I would raise the forecast if credible odds, expert ballots, or reporting indicate she is a favorite in any one category (e.g., market odds >35–40% in a single category), or if the categories she’s in look comparatively soft. I would lower it if confirmed categories pit her against dominant favorites in all cases or if markets/experts broadly price her as a long-shot (<10–12% per category).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
