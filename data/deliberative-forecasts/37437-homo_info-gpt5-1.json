    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the low base rate and the absence of lead indicators, which I already leaned on. The most compelling added point is the linguistic hurdle: Washington may deliberately avoid the term “invasion” even if PLA ground forces seized a small outlying islet, given One China sensitivities and escalation management. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on likely US phrasing (“attack/assault” vs. “invasion”) is a meaningful downward nudge. Forecaster 3 similarly highlights wording caution and narrows the set of triggering scenarios. Other points (e.g., 2027 readiness focus, blockade being more plausible) are consistent with my prior view. No strong new evidence raises the probability.",
    "rationale": "I maintain that a PLA ground landing within the next ~8 weeks is extremely unlikely: such an operation would be complex, risky, and preceded by visible mobilization, which is not evident. The resolution’s dual requirement—PLA ground forces entering Taiwan-controlled territory and a US government public accusation of “invasion”—is stringent. Many plausible escalations (missile strikes, blockade/quarantine, Coast Guard or militia coercion) would not resolve Yes. Incorporating the added argument from peers about US wording caution further reduces odds that even a limited landing would be labeled an “invasion” by Washington. That linguistic hurdle pushes me slightly down from my prior 2%. I would move up only on credible reporting of amphibious/airborne mobilization and PRC domestic war-prep measures; I would move further down if we reach mid-June without such indicators or if PLA activity clearly de-escalates.",
