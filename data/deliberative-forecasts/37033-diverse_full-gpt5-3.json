    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short window and bureaucratic/liquidity frictions, arguing that a rapid second cash tranche is atypical under current stress. They also note that the April cash may have satisfied the immediate cash portion for the first batch, reducing urgency. I hadn’t explicitly weighted the “two cash disbursements within ~7 weeks is unusually fast” point enough; that’s a solid practical constraint. They don’t add new factual evidence, but their operational cadence argument is persuasive. I still see underweighted upside in potential signaling incentives ahead of late-May international meetings (e.g., AfDB Annual Meetings), which could motivate a small second tranche to sustain reform optics.",
    "rationale": "Netting arguments: \n- For Yes: $6.9m remains in the 2025 budget line; demonstrated willingness with Feb BIPPA ($20m) and Apr GCD ($3.1m) payments; strong re-engagement incentives; an additional small payment timed to late-May international fora would reinforce the arrears-clearance narrative. Administrative groundwork (740 approved claims) may allow quick follow-on disbursements. \n- For No: Very short timeline; severe drought and USD scarcity elevate competing priorities; governments typically space tranches; April 9 payment may have been a one-off signal for spring meetings with no immediate need to repeat; domestic sensitivity to paying former white farmers during a food crisis could argue for delay. \n- Interpretation: I continue to treat “payment” as cash-like disbursements (not bond issuance) given the example language. \nUpdate: I’m nudging down from 42% to 37% to reflect the credible friction/timing arguments. I stay moderately above my peers given plausible political signaling incentives near end-May and the presence of a dedicated budget line that could finance a small, symbolic second tranche within the window.",
