    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The Q1 2025 13F filing deadline is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway has held exactly 10,000,000 shares of Amazon since Q2 2019. Maintaining this position resolves the question as 'No' because the holding would not be 'greater than 10,000,000'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire's Q1 2025 13F filing lists a holding of 10,000,000 or fewer shares of Amazon.com, Inc. This would happen if they either maintained their long-standing position or decided to trim the stake.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of Berkshire's investment managers, likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, identified an opportunity in Amazon during Q1 2025 and decided to increase their allocation, purchasing at least one additional share and bringing the total holding to over 10,000,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. The most significant piece of evidence is Berkshire Hathaway's own trading history with Amazon. They established the 10,000,000 share position in 2019 and have not altered it for nearly six years, across more than 20 consecutive quarters. This powerful base rate of inaction suggests that the most probable outcome for any given quarter is that the position remains unchanged. An unchanged position resolves this question as 'No'.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because Berkshire's managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are actively seeking to deploy capital. Adding to an existing, successful position is a common portfolio management action if market conditions (e.g., a temporary price dip in Q1 2025) or their fundamental analysis warranted it. Therefore, a purchase is a plausible, albeit low-probability, event.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is no specific catalyst or evidence to suggest that Q1 2025 was the quarter to break from this multi-year pattern of inertia. Attributing a higher probability would underweight the strong historical precedent of holding the position static.\n\nTo update my forecast higher, I would need to see information suggesting a change in strategy, such as a significant and sustained drop in Amazon's stock price during Q1 2025. To update lower, I would look for news indicating a broader shift by Berkshire away from large-cap technology holdings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
