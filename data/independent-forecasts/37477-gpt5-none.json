    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "22 days (window ends May 31, 2025; outcome known by June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — at least one of the two front pages continues to include “tariff”/“tariffs” every remaining publication day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rolling policy moves or political debate keep tariffs in the daily news cycle (e.g., new U.S. tariff announcements, foreign retaliation, market reactions), leading the WSJ or NYT to include the word on the front page every day through May 31.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before June 1, both front pages are dominated by other stories (e.g., geopolitics, courts, economy/inflation, AI/tech, corporate crises) and either skip trade entirely or use synonyms like “duties,” “levies,” or “import taxes,” so the exact word “tariff(s)” doesn’t appear on either front page.",
    "rationale": "What must happen for a Yes is modest: there only needs to be a single day in the remaining window when both front pages omit the exact word “tariff”/“tariffs.” The counterfactual No requires that at least one of the two papers prints the word every day until May 31. Given typical front-page variety, a single “clean” day is plausible even amid elevated tariff news. However, the environment is tariff-heavy under the new administration, and the WSJ especially is prone to daily trade coverage, so the hurdle isn’t trivial.\n\nA simple way to frame this is to think in terms of a daily probability p that both front pages omit the term. If p were around 5%, the chance of at least one success over ~22 days is 1 − (0.95)^22 ≈ 67%; if p were closer to 3–4%, that aggregate chance is roughly 50–60%. The prompt notes the criteria haven’t yet been satisfied since the open date (likely mid-April), which weakly suggests p has been on the low side recently. Using a conservative Bayesian read (e.g., observing ~0 successes over a few weeks nudges p into the low single digits), we still get a material chance of at least one clean day in the remaining 22 days.\n\nWhy not higher? Tariff policy is currently a marquee, recurring storyline; either paper could easily include the word in a subhead, caption, or teaser most days, and WSJ’s business slant raises that likelihood. Why not lower? Front pages rotate topics, and the exact string “tariff(s)” isn’t guaranteed even when trade is covered (synonyms often appear). With many days left, the odds of at least one clean day remain decent.\n\nUpdates that would move me up: a stretch of a few days where one paper avoids the term despite trade stories (signaling a higher daily p), or clear signs the tariff news cycle cools. Down: a scheduled major tariff package/reprisal in late May or evidence that both papers are using the word nearly every day (sustained near-daily front-page usage). Research assistant provided no additional data, so the forecast leans on editorial patterns and simple aggregation math rather than observed counts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
