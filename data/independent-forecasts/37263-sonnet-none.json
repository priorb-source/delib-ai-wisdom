    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 2, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos Islands",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uber continues not to operate in Turks and Caicos due to the small market size (population ~40,000-50,000), regulatory barriers around taxi licensing, insufficient tourism demand to justify market entry costs, and the protected local taxi industry. The restrictive regulatory environment highlighted in the April 2025 article about illegal taxis remains unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber successfully launches service in Turks and Caicos between now and July 1, 2025. This would require: (1) negotiating and obtaining regulatory approval from local authorities, (2) recruiting and onboarding a sufficient driver base, (3) establishing local operations infrastructure, and (4) completing technical integration - all within a compressed 2-month timeframe.",
    "rationale": "I assign a low probability to this outcome for several reasons. First, the status quo strongly suggests Uber is not currently operating in Turks and Caicos. The small market size (only 40,000-50,000 residents) makes it economically marginal for Uber, which typically prioritizes larger markets. Second, the April 2025 article about tourism stakeholders being warned against illegal taxis indicates a regulatory environment protective of the traditional taxi industry, creating barriers to ride-sharing entry. Third, Uber launching in a completely new market typically requires months of regulatory negotiations, driver recruitment, and infrastructure setup - compressing this into 60 days would be highly unusual. Fourth, my research assistant provided no information suggesting any imminent Uber launch plans or existing operations. While Turks and Caicos does have significant tourism which could theoretically attract Uber's interest, the company has historically avoided very small island markets with regulatory complexities. My forecast is not higher because there's no positive evidence of Uber's presence or launch plans, and the regulatory/market barriers are substantial. My forecast is not lower (not near 0%) because there's a small possibility that: (1) Uber is already operating there but not widely publicized, (2) there are undisclosed launch plans in advanced stages, or (3) a rapid tourism-focused launch could occur. I would update higher if I saw evidence of Uber driver recruitment, regulatory approval announcements, or Uber's website showing the location. I would update lower with explicit confirmation that Uber has no current operations or plans there.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
