    "review": "The other forecasters make reasonable arguments but appear to lack a critical piece of information that I have access to: the May 8, 2025 Morning Consult data showing Sánchez at 35% and Erdoğan at 32%. Forecaster 2 explicitly states they're relying on 'historical patterns' without specific January 2025 baseline numbers, and Forecaster 3 similarly notes they lack 'access to the specific current Morning Consult ratings from May 2025.' Both are therefore forecasting based on general historical patterns (Erdoğan typically having stronger approval) rather than current data. Forecaster 2's claim that Erdoğan typically operates in the 40-50% range while Sánchez is in the 30-40% range may have historical validity, but contradicts the actual May 2025 data I have. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting point about Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative that I hadn't considered - this could indeed be a wildcard. However, if this reform was announced before May 8, it would already be reflected in the current data. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the short timeframe and status quo bias, which actually strengthens my position since I have recent data showing Sánchez ahead. Their forecasts of 35% and 42% appear to be hedging against uncertainty when lacking current data, rather than being grounded in the most recent polling.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I remain confident in my higher forecast, though I'm making a slight downward adjustment to account for the constitutional reform uncertainty raised by Forecaster 3. My key advantage is having actual May 8, 2025 data showing Sánchez leading Erdoğan 35% to 32% - just three weeks before my reference date and five weeks before resolution. The other forecasters explicitly lack this information and are forecasting based on historical patterns alone. While their point about Erdoğan historically having stronger approval is valid, it's contradicted by current reality. The constitutional reform initiative is a legitimate wildcard that could affect Erdoğan's ratings, though it could cut either way - consolidating his base or raising authoritarian concerns. However, with only 32 days remaining until resolution, and approval ratings typically being sticky month-to-month, a 3-point reversal would require a significant event or shift. The short timeframe strongly favors the status quo outcome, which currently shows Sánchez ahead. I'm adjusting down from 72% to 70% to acknowledge the constitutional reform uncertainty and show appropriate humility, but not dramatically lowering my forecast since recent data is highly predictive over short horizons and the other forecasters' lower estimates appear to reflect their information disadvantage rather than superior analysis.",
