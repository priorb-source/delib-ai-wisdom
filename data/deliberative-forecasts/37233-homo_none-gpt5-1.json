    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core logic I used: no legal or procedural need to declare by early June, Ivorian precedent of late announcements, and the importance of RHDP scheduling (e.g., a congress/investiture) as the key catalyst. Forecaster 3 adds a useful nuance on reputational/international sensitivities after 2020 and age as incentives to delay or avoid an early declaration—this doesn’t prove a later timing but modestly strengthens the prior against a May announcement. Neither presents concrete evidence of a May RHDP event, which keeps the base case tilted to No. Overall, I find their reasoning sound and slightly more conservative on timing than my initial stance.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about a month, with no reported fixed May RHDP congress/investiture compelling a declaration. In 2020, Ouattara accepted the nomination in August for an October vote, and Ivorian candidacy formalizations often cluster closer to mid/late summer. There’s no legal deadline that forces a May decision. If he runs, he can still maximize flexibility by waiting, gauging the opposition and internal party dynamics. A path to Yes exists if RHDP schedules and signals a May investiture or if senior figures indicate he will accept imminently. Absent that, the status quo favors No. I’m revising down from 33% to 26%, giving more weight to the short fuse, lack of known May party milestones, and the added consideration that, given the contentious 2020 precedent and his age, there’s little strategic benefit to rushing an early declaration unless RHDP orchestrates it this May.",
