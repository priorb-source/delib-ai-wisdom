    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known after the resolution window closes on June 15, 2025, which is approximately five weeks from today's date of May 7, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct phone calls between these specific leaders are infrequent and are not the default mode of communication. The status quo is that no such call is scheduled or expected within this short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between May 12 and June 15, 2025, passes without any major, acute crisis or diplomatic breakthrough that would necessitate a direct and publicly acknowledged phone call. Bilateral communications continue through routine, lower-level diplomatic channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden international crisis, for instance a significant military escalation in the Taiwan Strait or a severe, targeted economic action, occurs and prompts an urgent need for de-escalation. Both leaders hold a call to manage the situation, which is subsequently confirmed by officials in both Washington and Beijing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the low base rate of publicly acknowledged phone calls between heads of state, especially between the US and China. Such calls are significant diplomatic events, not routine occurrences. The resolution window is very narrow, at just over one month, which dramatically shortens the time for a precipitating event and subsequent call to be arranged. The current diplomatic environment, referencing past disputes over whether calls have even taken place, suggests a high bar for communication, let alone a call that meets the strict criterion of being acknowledged by both parties. My research assistant's report confirms there is no available information to suggest a call is being planned.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the relationship between the US and China is volatile, with several potential flashpoints. An unforeseen crisis is a non-trivial possibility, and such an event is the most likely catalyst for a leader-level call. A sudden military or economic event could force direct communication to prevent escalation.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because there is currently no public evidence of an impending crisis or a planned diplomatic breakthrough that would necessitate a call. Without a specific catalyst on the horizon, the default assumption that a call will not happen holds strong. A higher probability would be speculative and contrary to the status quo.\n\nI would raise my forecast upon news of a significant military incident involving both nations or if senior diplomats announce that a leader-level call is being arranged. I would lower my forecast if the international environment remains stable and no high-level engagements are announced as the resolution window progresses.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
