    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments for significantly lower probabilities than my initial 30%. They raise several points I hadn't fully weighted: (1) The Q2 fundraising deadline (June 30) as a specific near-term incentive - this is a concrete reason someone might announce before July 1, but the lack of any preparation by early June suggests Suarez isn't planning to capitalize on it; (2) Forecaster 3's point about Suarez's 2023 presidential bid showing he can move quickly is interesting but may not apply equally to a gubernatorial campaign which requires more state-level groundwork; (3) Both emphasize the competitive field dynamics with Donalds already having Trump's endorsement, making a rushed entry less attractive. The most persuasive argument is the complete absence of preparatory signals. For a statewide gubernatorial announcement within 26 days, we would expect to see something by now - paperwork, staff movement, venue reservations, donor meetings, or credible leaks. The status quo of 'considering' without concrete action is a strong signal against imminent announcement. My initial 30% gave too much weight to the possibility of surprise announcements and not enough to the practical realities of launching a gubernatorial campaign. However, I don't think the probability should be quite as low as 12% because the Q2 deadline does create real incentive and 26 days is technically sufficient time if Suarez makes a sudden decision.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm convinced my initial 30% was too high. The complete absence of preparatory signals (no exploratory committee, no leaks, no scheduled events, no paperwork) as of early June is the strongest evidence against an announcement in the next 26 days. While the Q2 fundraising deadline (June 30) provides a theoretical incentive to announce before July 1, the lack of any visible preparation suggests Suarez isn't planning to take advantage of it. The competitive field with Donalds already holding Trump's endorsement and polling at 5% both suggest strategic reasons to wait rather than rush. However, I'm keeping my forecast slightly higher than the lowest estimate (12%) because: politicians can make relatively quick decisions, 26 days remains technically sufficient, and the historical timing window (12-18 months pre-primary) still technically accommodates an announcement. The status quo strongly favors no announcement, but I'm maintaining a small probability for the possibility of a rapid decision.",
