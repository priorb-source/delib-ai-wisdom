    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my base-rate view: international location, short lead time, and lack of strong signals make attendance unlikely. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point about the fight card lacking an exceptional marquee draw, which modestly lowers the pull. Forecaster 3’s scenario-thinking about tacking on UFC to other Canada travel is fair but speculative; also, the reference to a “sitting president” raises uncertainty—security/coordination constraints are significant either way, but the exact status matters. Neither analysis discussed Canadian inadmissibility/entry-permit frictions post-conviction, which I consider a meaningful additional obstacle. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and reinforces a low, non-zero probability, but doesn’t introduce decisive new evidence to move materially from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time to event is ~12 days. Status quo is that Trump attends domestic UFCs and has not attended international cards; there are no credible signals (permits, security leaks, UFC teases) pointing to a Montreal visit. Added frictions include potential Canadian admissibility hurdles requiring a Temporary Resident Permit, heightened security/logistics for a high-profile figure abroad, and a recent Miami appearance that reduces cadence likelihood. The absence of Rogan marginally lowers the social/entourage draw. Upside scenarios exist (rapid TRP issuance, surprise cameo, or pairing with other Canada travel), but lack of lead indicators this close to the event keeps them low probability. Given that the other forecasters’ arguments largely mirror my own and do not offset the Canada-entry/logistics headwinds I emphasized, I am not updating materially.",
