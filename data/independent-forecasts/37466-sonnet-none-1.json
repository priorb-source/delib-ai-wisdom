    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display the body of water as 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas maintains the traditional 'Gulf of Mexico' designation on their North America page, either due to adhering to international geographic naming standards, waiting for official recognition by international geographic authorities, or treating the political push for 'Gulf of America' as controversial/temporary. The article page acknowledgment of 'Gulf of America' in parentheses may remain separate from their main map pages.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas updates their North America page to display 'Gulf of America' either alone or alongside 'Gulf of Mexico.' This could occur as a simple website editorial decision to reflect recent U.S. government preferences, especially given that their article page already acknowledges both names. As a private website, they could implement this change quickly without waiting for international consensus.",
    "rationale": "The most significant piece of evidence is that WorldAtlas's article already displays 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' in its title, demonstrating awareness of and some accommodation to the proposed name change. This suggests the organization is at least partially receptive to adopting the new terminology.\n\nHowever, several factors favor the status quo: (1) The question asks specifically about the North America overview page, not the individual article page, and these may be maintained differently. (2) Geographic names and map labels traditionally change slowly, even for private websites, as they typically follow established geographic naming conventions. (3) The timeframe is short (54 days), though website updates can happen quickly. (4) There's no direct evidence that WorldAtlas has committed to updating their main map pages.\n\nStatus quo bias is important here - geographic names are sticky, and most changes don't happen on political timescales. However, this is balanced by the fact that WorldAtlas is a private U.S.-based website that can make editorial decisions independently.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: there's no concrete evidence of planned updates to the North America page specifically, the article acknowledgment might be as far as they go, and traditional geographic naming practices favor stability.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: the article title shows openness to the new name, websites can update quickly when motivated, and less than 2 months is actually plenty of time for a simple text/label change.\n\nI would update higher if: evidence emerged of WorldAtlas updating other map pages, official statements about adopting the name, or patterns of quick map updates. I would update lower if: evidence showed they strictly follow international standards, or statements that they're waiting for official geographic body recognition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
