  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest. Comey remains free while investigation continues or concludes without charges.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation concludes without sufficient evidence to overcome First Amendment protections. Legal experts' assessment proves correct that the 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten creates insurmountable obstacles. The case quietly closes or DOJ declines to prosecute given the legal hurdles and Comey's stated explanation that he was unaware of the violent connotations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The DOJ moves rapidly to file charges within the next few weeks, citing additional evidence gathered during the investigation. A warrant is issued, possibly claiming that context and timing demonstrate intent to threaten. Political pressure accelerates the process, and Comey is arrested before July 1st, even if the charges face likely First Amendment challenges in court.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weighs the status quo outcome because significant legal and procedural barriers exist. As of late May 2025, no charges, warrants, or subpoenas have been issued despite weeks passing since the Instagram post and Secret Service interview. The compressed one-month timeline makes an arrest increasingly unlikely given that the legal process typically moves slowly.\n\nKey factors suggesting low probability: (1) Strong First Amendment protections for political speech; (2) 2023 Supreme Court precedent requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten; (3) Comey deleted the post and provided an explanation that he opposed violence; (4) Arresting former FBI directors is historically extremely rare in the United States; (5) No formal legal action has been initiated despite ongoing investigation.\n\nFactors preventing this from being even lower: (1) The investigation is active and confirmed by DHS Secretary; (2) High-profile political figures are calling for prosecution; (3) One month is technically enough time for rapid legal action if DOJ decides to move aggressively; (4) The current political environment appears hostile to Comey.\n\nFor my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: formal charges filed, a warrant issued, or credible reporting that indictment is imminent from reliable legal sources (not InfoWars). For it to move lower: the investigation concluding without charges, passing more time closer to July 1st without action, or DOJ officials stating they won't prosecute.\n\nThe most likely scenario remains that legal proceedings, if they occur at all, will extend well beyond July 1st, making an arrest before that date unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
