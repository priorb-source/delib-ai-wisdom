    "review": "My initial forecast of 90% was in close alignment with the other two experts (87% and 92%). We all agree on the core evidence: the historical and, particularly, recent trends in monthly sighting reports from NUFORC make a 'Yes' outcome highly probable. The data from 2023, 2024, and early 2025 all show monthly totals well in excess of the 400-report threshold. \n\nI found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly insightful for two reasons that I had not explicitly weighed. First, the quantitative breakdown of the daily reporting rate needed (~13.3) versus the recent average (~17.2) provided a tangible measure of the ~30% 'cushion' protecting against a 'No' outcome. Second, they correctly identified summer seasonality as a likely positive driver for reports and noted that the resolution criteria (checking on or after July 1) effectively mitigates the risk of reporting lags artificially lowering the June total. Forecaster 2 also helpfully articulated the risk of administrative or methodological changes at NUFORC, a key reason for not being near-certain.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 90% to 92%. The fundamental basis for my forecast remains the same: the strong and consistent trend of NUFORC monthly reports far exceeding 400 for at least the last 16 months. The average monthly reporting figure for the first four months of 2025 (~517) is substantially higher than the threshold in question. \n\nMy increase in confidence is a direct result of the deliberation. Forecaster 3's quantification of the ~30% buffer between the recent average daily reporting rate and the rate required to meet the threshold gives me greater confidence that random monthly fluctuations are unlikely to result in a 'No'. Furthermore, factoring in summer seasonality as a likely tailwind for reporting and recognizing that the resolution criteria negatesmuch of the risk from reporting lags, I believe a slightly higher probability is warranted. The remaining 8% uncertainty accounts for low-probability but high-impact events, such as an extended technical outage of the NUFORC website or an unannounced major change in their report vetting or counting methodology.",
