  "information": "Uber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uber continues its focus on major international markets and high-tech partnerships, viewing the small market of Turks and Caicos as a low priority. The local government, supported by the established taxi industry, maintains regulatory barriers that prevent or discourage Uber from launching operations by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move to modernize the local transport system and combat unregulated 'illegal taxis', the Turks and Caicos government fast-tracks an agreement with Uber to launch 'Uber Taxi', a service that integrates licensed local taxi drivers onto the Uber platform, which goes live just before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo. Currently, Uber is not available in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the two-month timeframe until the resolution date is extremely short for a new market entry. This process typically involves navigating local regulations, establishing operations, and recruiting drivers. The research report indicates Uber's strategic focus is on large markets (like Curitiba, Brazil) and technology ventures (like autonomous vehicles in Texas), not small island nations. The Turks and Caicos, with a small resident population, does not align with this demonstrated strategy. Furthermore, the provided background article from April 2025, which warns against 'illegal taxis', signals a protective and potentially hostile regulatory environment toward outside ride-sharing services, likely influenced by a strong local taxi lobby. This represents a significant barrier to entry.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because there is a non-zero chance of a rapid, partnership-based entry. As seen in other markets, Uber can use an 'Uber Taxi' model to partner with existing licensed drivers. An agreement could have been in negotiation for some time and could be announced and launched quickly, positioning Uber as a solution to regulate and modernize the existing taxi fleet rather than as a competitor.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the combination of the short timeframe, Uber's strategic priorities lying elsewhere, and clear indicators of local regulatory resistance makes a successful launch by July 1 highly improbable. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports of active negotiations between Uber and the Turks and Caicos government or a major local taxi association.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
