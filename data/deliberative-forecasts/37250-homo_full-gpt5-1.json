    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong, coherent case for a low single‑digit probability given two aligned veto players (U.S. executive and El Salvador) and a short timeline. Forecaster 3 adds a useful nuance I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the Supreme Court’s directive to “facilitate” is weaker than an order to “produce,” enabling the administration to claim best efforts while being stymied by El Salvador, which blunts near‑term judicial leverage. Both also correctly stress that incarceration in a Salvadoran max‑security facility makes irregular entry impossible, so only a coordinated or unilateral state action can produce a Yes. I find their reasoning convincing and broadly consistent with my own, but it argues for a slightly lower probability than my initial 12%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining: ~61 days (May 1 to July 1, 2025). Status quo outcome is No: the U.S. administration is resisting compliance, and El Salvador is detaining Garcia with explicit refusal to release or return him. A No scenario is simply continued Salvadoran detention plus U.S. claims of “facilitation” without concrete steps. A Yes scenario would likely require: (1) U.S. instruction to State/DHS/CBP to issue parole/travel docs and actively coordinate; (2) El Salvador agreeing to release/expel him; (3) rapid transport to U.S. soil, where even brief admission would resolve Yes.\n\nWhy I’m lowering: The combination of (a) weaker “facilitate” language, allowing the administration to posture compliance; (b) dual sovereign vetoes; (c) missed court deadlines without consequence so far; and (d) the diplomatic posture (embassy not instructed) makes a turnaround by July 1 unlikely. Courts can escalate (contempt, fines), but such measures often take time to bite and cannot force El Salvador’s hand. Without visible signals—embassy instructions, parole issuance, Salvadoran openness—the base rate for fast reversals in politically salient, adversarial cases is low.\n\nWhy not lower still: A unanimous Supreme Court ruling is unusually salient; if the district court imposes meaningful, personal consequences or if the administration seeks a face‑saving compliance, the U.S. could rapidly green‑light the mechanics. The resolution bar is minimal—any physical entry counts—even if followed by immediate re‑removal. Also, Bukele could, in principle, choose unilateral expulsion if it served his interests. These are real but low‑probability paths within the time window.\n\nNet: Incorporating the other forecasters’ points, especially the “facilitate” nuance and the practical impossibility of irregular entry from max‑security detention, I adjust down modestly from 12% to reflect the stubborn status quo and short timeline.",
