    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the base-rate point that artists with 5–6 nominations at the ACMs are rarely shut out, and they lean on Stapleton’s exceptionally strong track record with the same voter universe (CMA/Grammy overlap). That isn’t new information, but it reinforces the idea that the “at least one win” probability is driven more by multiplicity of chances than by any single category. They also appropriately flag spread-the-wealth dynamics and strong rivals (Wallen, Johnson, Wilson, Langley). What’s missing is category-level head-to-head analysis or market/insider signals, but given the time horizon, the base-rate logic remains compelling. Overall, their arguments nudge me to weight cross-award momentum (White Horse; the Carly Pearce duet for Music Event/Visual Media; Male Artist history) a bit more heavily than in my prior 80%.",
    "rationale": "I previously set 80% on the view that while Stapleton has many paths, outcomes across categories are correlated and this is a competitive cycle. After considering the other forecasters’ emphasis on multi-nomination base rates and his recent cross-award momentum, I’m modestly increasing. He reportedly has six nominations, giving numerous avenues: Male Artist (a category where he’s historically strong), Single of the Year for White Horse (fresh off major CMA wins), and the Carly Pearce collaboration (credible for Music Event/Visual Media). Even if Entertainer and Album tilt toward touring/commerce-heavy rivals, he still has several plausible shots. A simple sanity check: with six categories, if two are ~35–45% (Male Artist; Music Event) and several others ~20–30%, the complement (no wins) plausibly falls near 10–20% after accounting for correlation. Risks remain: ACM voters could consolidate behind Wallen/Johnson/Wilson; outcomes are correlated; and ACMs often distribute hardware. But the multiplicity plus momentum argues for a number in the low-to-mid 80s. I’m updating from 80% to 85% to reflect that weighting.",
