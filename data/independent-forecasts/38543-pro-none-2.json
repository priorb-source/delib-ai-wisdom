    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump remains in the United States or travels elsewhere, with no visit to China materializing. The logistical and diplomatic preparations required for such a high-profile trip are not initiated or completed within the short remaining timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected and urgent event, such as a back-channel diplomatic invitation or a critical business negotiation, prompts Donald Trump to make a hastily arranged, last-minute trip to China that is successfully completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The primary basis for my forecast is the extremely short time remaining until the deadline. Today is June 15, 2025, leaving only about two weeks for a potential visit to occur. Arranging international travel for a figure of Donald Trump's stature, especially to a country like China, involves immense logistical, security, and diplomatic planning that typically takes weeks or months, not days. The status quo is that no such visit is planned or has been publicly discussed. As a private citizen, Mr. Trump lacks the official state apparatus that facilitates presidential travel, making a rapid deployment even more complex. The current political climate and his likely focus on domestic matters further reduce the probability of such a trip.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because Donald Trump has a history of unconventional actions, and the possibility of a 'black swan' event or a highly secret, rapidly executed meeting cannot be entirely dismissed. However, the probability is not higher because the practical barriers are immense. The complete absence of any public chatter or reporting on a potential visit makes the likelihood of it happening in the next 16 days exceedingly small.\n\nI would significantly increase my forecast if credible news reports emerged from reputable sources indicating that a visit was being actively planned or if either Mr. Trump's team or Chinese officials made a public statement to that effect.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
