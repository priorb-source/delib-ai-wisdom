    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not visit Russia in this window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House maintains current travel plans focused on domestic priorities and allied visits; any engagement with Putin occurs via calls or a third-country venue. Security, diplomatic, and political costs of a Russia trip remain prohibitive, and no credible reporting of such a visit emerges before June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A surprise, quickly arranged summit in Moscow or St. Petersburg late June aimed at a Ukraine ceasefire framework or a high-visibility prisoner swap; both sides signal a breakthrough and accept the optics of a leader-level meeting on Russian soil, with Secret Service and Russian security coordinating a short, tightly controlled visit.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and context: Since the invasion of Ukraine, US–Russia relations have been at their lowest point in decades. A US presidential visit to Russia under current conditions would be unprecedentedly controversial and logistically complex. Trump did not visit Russia in his first term; the last US presidential visit to Russia was in 2009 (Obama). Given the current war and sanctions, the default is no trip.\n- Timing and logistics: There is only about a month left. Presidential travel of this sensitivity typically leaks or is signaled; as of May 30 there are no public indications. While secret trips are possible (e.g., Biden to Kyiv), those were to allied territory. A Russia visit would require extensive coordination and would likely be telegraphed by credible press reports.\n- Trump-specific upside risk: Trump’s penchant for headline-grabbing diplomacy (e.g., DMZ meeting with Kim in 2019) modestly raises tail risk. A potential driver could be a ceasefire initiative or a major prisoner swap, where he might value personal optics. Russia would likely welcome the optics too. This keeps the probability above near-zero.\n- Why not higher: The political, alliance-management, and security downsides are substantial; domestic backlash and NATO/Ukraine optics make a June visit costly. The absence of credible reports so close to the window further suppresses odds.\n- Why not lower: Trump’s unpredictability and prior willingness to meet adversaries on short notice create a small but real path, especially if linked to a breakthrough negotiation.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of planned Trump–Putin talks in Russia; White House or Kremlin readouts hinting at a leader-level meeting on Russian soil; signs of a near-term ceasefire framework; concrete logistics tells (e.g., airspace/NOTAM changes, security pre-advances) tied to dates in late June.\n- What would move me down: Public denial from the White House; firm scheduling that occupies late June with other travel; renewed battlefield escalation or diplomatic breakdown making such a visit politically untenable.\n- Research assistant note: No additional information available, which reinforces the reliance on base rates and the lack of signals indicating an imminent visit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
