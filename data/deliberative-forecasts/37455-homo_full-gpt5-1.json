    "review": "Both forecasters present solid, largely aligned reasoning. New/useful emphasis beyond my prior: (1) the resolution hinges on the map showing “Available,” not “Coming Soon/Waitlist,” which can lag; (2) practical frictions around device type approval, payments, and especially shipping/imports given Lesotho’s reliance on transit via South Africa; and (3) the enclaved geography may increase Starlink’s caution to prevent cross‑border use into South Africa. These are credible, especially the logistics/transit via SA and type-approval points, which I had underweighted. I agree with their upward factors (license is the key hurdle; recent Africa rollouts can be fast; geofencing + ISLs lower technical barriers). Overall, F2’s slightly lower stance (58%) reflects operational/prioritization risks; F3’s 68% reflects the strong post-license activation trend. I find both persuasive; the additional logistics/“Available” vs “Coming Soon” nuance nudges me slightly down from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Lesotho’s 10-year license (Apr 14) removes the main barrier. Starlink’s recent behavior (e.g., DRC going from license to availability within days in early May) demonstrates the capability to flip the availability map quickly. With ~54 days left, there are multiple opportunities for a batch map update. Technical constraints are modest due to ISLs/geofencing. However, three risks keep this from being much higher: (1) Operational/administrative steps such as user terminal type approvals, local billing/tax setup, and establishing order/shipping flows; (2) Logistics/import via South Africa for a landlocked enclave could introduce delays even if transit is legally permissible; and (3) heightened regulatory sensitivity to cross-border misuse given South Africa’s non-licensure may prompt extra caution before flipping to “Available.” Lesotho’s small market may reduce prioritization in the near term. Balancing the cleared license and fast recent rollouts against these frictions, I slightly trim my estimate from earlier but remain above even odds.",
