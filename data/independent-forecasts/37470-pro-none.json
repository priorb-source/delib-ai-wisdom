    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made regarding the host for the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship. If the deadline passes without an announcement that Egypt has been chosen, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite a positive meeting, the formal decision-making and approval process within the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) takes longer than expected, pushing any announcement past the July 1, 2025 deadline. Alternatively, another country's bid is ultimately selected over Egypt's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the successful meeting between Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports and the ITKF President, the federation quickly finalizes the hosting agreement and formally announces Egypt as the host for the 2026 World Championship in a press release or official statement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the recent, high-level meeting on May 7, 2025, between Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Ashraf Sobhi, and the ITKF President, Gilberto Gaertner. The reporting on this meeting indicates strong intent and capability from Egypt, met with a positive reception from the ITKF. The Minister confirmed 'full support,' and the ITKF President 'praised the sports infrastructure.' Such a meeting between the key political and sport federation heads is a very strong signal that a deal is close to being finalized. Since the championship is in 2026, a hosting decision is needed imminently to allow for adequate preparation time. The recent timing of this meeting, less than two months before the question's deadline, suggests that an announcement is likely forthcoming. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the provided information does not mention other potential host countries, which represents a significant unknown. Furthermore, international sports federations can have bureaucratic processes that might delay a formal announcement past the deadline, even if an agreement in principle has been reached.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the evidence of the high-level meeting is a significant event that disrupts the status quo. Public statements of this nature are not typically made unless both parties are serious and a positive outcome is anticipated. The strong backing of the Egyptian government is a critical factor that makes their bid highly credible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
