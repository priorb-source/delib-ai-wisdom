    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I underweighted. Forecaster 3 identifies a critical factor I missed: Taiwan's May 20 inauguration (only 14 days away from my forecast date) as a concrete near-term trigger event. This is highly relevant given the short timeframe. Both forecasters also provide more specific mechanisms - Forecaster 3 particularly notes that China could implement 'maritime traffic control,' 'quarantine,' or 'inspection' regimes that effectively close a port without initially using blockade language, potentially forcing the US to respond with that terminology. The April 2025 'Strait Thunder-2025A' exercises explicitly simulated blockade operations, suggesting heightened preparation. Forecaster 3's point about Congressional willingness to use 'blockade' terminology is also relevant since the question asks about 'US government' broadly, not just the Executive Branch. However, I find Forecaster 2's 4% too low - it doesn't adequately account for the May 20 inauguration window and the tail risks from grey-zone escalation. Forecaster 3's 12% is more defensible but perhaps slightly optimistic about the probability of China taking such a risky step and the US using that specific terminology.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain that the base case strongly favors NO, but I underweighted the May 20 inauguration as a specific catalyst. My initial 10% didn't fully account for this concrete near-term event occurring within our resolution window. The mechanisms identified by Forecaster 3 (inspection regimes, maritime notices) provide plausible pathways to an effective blockade that could force US characterization. The April 2025 exercises showing explicit blockade simulations are also more concerning than I initially weighted. However, I still believe the historical precedent is decisive - the US avoided 'blockade' language even during the 1995-96 crisis. The diplomatic costs of using such inflammatory language remain high, and active Shanghai talks suggest both sides are managing escalation. China also has strong incentives to avoid a true blockade given economic and military risks. The inauguration may trigger enhanced drills, but crossing from drills to actual port closure remains a massive escalation. I'm updating upward from 10% to 11% to account for the inauguration timing and the specific mechanisms identified, but not as high as 12% because the fundamental historical and diplomatic constraints remain very strong.",
