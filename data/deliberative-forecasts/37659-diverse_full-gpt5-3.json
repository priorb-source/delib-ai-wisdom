    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize how small the remaining gap is (15) relative to the time horizon and the reported pipeline (44 in progress). I agree the April 8–16 pace (0.625/day) easily clears the threshold, but I’m wary of extrapolating from that short window—especially since it’s now May 16, and we don’t have a current count. I also agree with the identified risks: possible deceleration, methodology changes, or tracker maintenance lapses. Forecaster 2’s 92% feels too high given the data staleness and reliance on a brief early rate; Forecaster 3’s 80% better reflects those uncertainties. A valuable addition from them is the explicit conversion math: needing ~34% of the April 16 “in progress” items to flip to “Done” by July 1 would suffice, which is a persuasive point in favor of Yes. They underweight, in my view, the chance that updates slow or that some items are reclassified, and they don’t fully account for the shorter runway if the count hasn’t moved since mid‑April.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of Apr 16, 105 Done and 44 In Progress. To reach 120 by Jul 1, need +15. From Apr 16 to Jul 1 is ~76 days (required ~0.2/day), but from today (May 16) it’s ~46 days; if still at 105, the required pace is ~0.33/day—meaning our confidence depends on whether progress has continued since mid‑April. The pipeline is the key: converting roughly one‑third of the 44 In Progress items by July 1 would reach 120 even without new items entering the pipeline. That seems plausible given typical administrative follow‑through, and the tracker’s visibility suggests it’s likely to remain maintained. Countervailing risks remain material: post‑honeymoon deceleration, potential legal or procedural setbacks delaying conversions, and tracker methodology or maintenance changes that slow “Done” classifications. Given the small remaining gap and the pipeline, the Yes outcome is more likely than not, but the lack of fresh data and the shorter remaining window cap confidence. I therefore nudge my estimate up from 72% to reflect the persuasive pipeline math, but not to the 90s given the uncertainties.",
