  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.\n\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th-ranked billionaire remains or becomes a non-U.S. individual, consistent with the recent occupants (Italy, then Russia) and with the base-rate distribution in the 200–300 band. Non-U.S. markets keep pace with or outperform U.S. equities into late June, the U.S. dollar is stable or weaker versus major currencies, and there’s no large U.S.-specific wealth jump near the cutoff. Result: a non-U.S. person is at #250 on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "U.S. equities outperform into late June, the U.S. dollar strengthens, and/or a U.S. billionaire near the cutoff experiences an idiosyncratic wealth jump (e.g., sector rally, corporate event), nudging a U.S. name to #250 on July 1 despite the non-U.S. majority in that band.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and status quo point to No. On Apr 30 the #250 was Giancarlo Devasini (Italy) and on May 29 it was Vladimir Potanin (Russia), so the median slot has recently been non-U.S. The research assistant notes that in ranks 200–300 roughly 62% are non-U.S. (≈38% U.S.), and overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has fallen from ~40% to ~35% over the past year. There is also a reported seasonal pattern with relatively weaker U.S. representation in Q1–Q2. July 1 sits right after Q2.\nCountervailing factors exist. Late May saw stronger U.S. equity sentiment and a rebound in consumer confidence; major-tech leadership could help U.S. billionaires around the cutoff. A stronger USD by July 1 would also mechanically shrink non-U.S. fortunes (in USD terms), slightly raising the chance the #250 is American. Still, movements at rank ~250 are noisy but anchored by the underlying composition, which favors non-U.S. holders more often than not.\nWhy not higher than my estimate? The distributional base rate (~35–38% U.S. at this depth) and the recent non-U.S. incumbents argue that, on any given day in late Q2, a non-U.S. name is more likely to sit at #250.\nWhy not lower? U.S. representation is still substantial; a one-day snapshot can flip with modest market or FX moves. U.S. equities have had supportive news flow, which slightly offsets the seasonal/structural headwinds.\nWhat would move me up? Clear relative outperformance of U.S. equities through June; USD appreciation versus EUR/CNY/INR; observing several U.S. names clustered right around ranks 245–255 in late June; any U.S.-specific corporate events affecting fortunes near the cutoff.\nWhat would move me down? Continued or accelerating outperformance of European/Asian/Indian markets; USD weakness; evidence that the immediate neighborhood (245–255) is dominated by non-U.S. names in the last week of June; methodology or data updates that disproportionately favor non-U.S. holdings.\nNetting these, I put extra weight on the status quo and base-rate composition and set the probability modestly below 40%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
