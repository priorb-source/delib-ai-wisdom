    "review": "I have reviewed the reasoning from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2 (24%) makes a very compelling case by focusing on the resolution criteria, specifically that both sides must acknowledge the call. They highlight a recent and crucial pattern where Trump claims calls and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) publicly denies them. Furthermore, they bring new evidence I had not considered: a May 5 statement from Trump of 'no immediate plans to speak with Xi,' which was corroborated by the MFA. This significantly weakens the case for an imminent, acknowledged call. Forecaster 3 (38%) introduces another important piece of new information: the scheduled May 10-11 Geneva talks, which they frame as a potential catalyst for a leader-level call. They also emphasize the severe economic pressure from the tariff war as a powerful incentive for communication. Both forecasters correctly identify the high bar set by the 'mutual acknowledgment' clause.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was primarily based on reports of a potential 'birthday summit,' which provided a specific reason for a call in the given timeframe. However, Forecaster 2's evidence of recent, direct statements from both sides ruling out 'immediate plans' for a call significantly undermines this thesis. His focus on China's established pattern of denying contact makes the 'mutual acknowledgment' requirement seem much harder to meet than I had originally appreciated. The status quo is not just a lack of communication, but an active, public dispute over whether communication is even happening. At the same time, Forecaster 3's point about the imminent Geneva talks provides a plausible, if uncertain, path to a 'Yes' outcome. A significant breakthrough in Geneva could be the exact catalyst needed to change the current dynamic and warrant an acknowledged leader call. Re-evaluating, I believe the barriers to an acknowledged call, as detailed by Forecaster 2, are more significant than the potential catalysts highlighted by Forecaster 3. The path to 'Yes' now seems contingent on a successful outcome at the Geneva talks, which is far from certain. Therefore, I am lowering my probability. I am not going as low as Forecaster 2 because I believe the Geneva talks and severe economic pressures still present a non-trivial chance for a breakthrough. My forecast now reflects that a 'No' is the more likely outcome, but a specific, upcoming event could plausibly change that.",
