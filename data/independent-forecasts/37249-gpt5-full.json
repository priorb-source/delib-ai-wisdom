  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (from May 1 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Local election and by‑election results are mixed or modest for Reform; subsequent national polls show Reform roughly tied with Labour or up by 1–2 points at most. Politico’s rolling average, which is sticky and lags single polls, never shows Reform ahead of the next party by 4+ points before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform wins the Runcorn and Helsby by‑election and significantly overperforms in the May local elections, triggering a media narrative of a realignment. Multiple high-quality pollsters (e.g., YouGov, Ipsos, Survation) repeatedly show Reform leads of 5–8 points over 1–2 weeks, pushing Politico’s poll-of-polls to a 4+ point Reform lead by late May or June.",
    "rationale": "- What the criterion requires: Politico’s UK poll-of-polls must show Reform in first place by 4 or more points at any point between May 1 and June 30. That’s a high bar because (a) it’s an average, not a single poll, and (b) the margin must be 4+ points over the second party.\n\n- State of play on May 1: The research assistant reports several late-April polls with Reform tied with or narrowly ahead of Labour (often 1–2 points). That establishes plausibility of Reform leading in individual polls. However, the resolution source is Politico’s rolling average, which typically weights by recency and sample size and moves more slowly than single polls. The assistant also notes an earlier analysis where Politico’s average had Reform much lower (around 14%) while Labour was ~34%—likely outdated but illustrative of how lagging averages can be versus headline-grabbing single polls.\n\n- Status quo weighting: Inertia favors “No.” Moving an aggregator to a 4+ point lead requires a sustained sequence of polls from multiple firms showing a sizable Reform advantage. Current evidence suggests Reform is competitive or slightly ahead, not decisively ahead by the necessary margin. Without a clear shock, the average is more likely to hover around parity than to cross a 4-point gap.\n\n- Catalysts and headwinds: The May 1 local elections and the Runcorn and Helsby by‑election are immediate catalysts. A decisive Reform performance could elevate their polling in early-to-mid May and potentially produce the sustained 5–8 point leads needed to move Politico’s average to 4+. Conversely, an underwhelming performance would likely cap momentum and keep the average below the threshold.\n\n- Why not higher: The requirement is stringent (4+ points in the poll-of-polls), and averages are sticky. Current polling indicates narrow leads or ties, not the consistent, multi-poll 5–8 point margins typically needed to push an average to a 4+ point lead.\n\n- Why not lower: Momentum and volatility appear elevated. Pollsters report unusual dissatisfaction with both major parties, and some late-April polls already have Reform marginally ahead. A strong electoral showing this week could catalyze further gains, making a 4+ point average lead conceivable late in the window.\n\n- What would change my view: Upward revision if, in the next 10–14 days, multiple major pollsters repeatedly show Reform 5–8 points ahead and Politico’s tracker visibly narrows to within ~1–2 points of a 4-point gap. Downward revision if local/by‑election results disappoint and polls revert to Labour leads or persistent ties.",
