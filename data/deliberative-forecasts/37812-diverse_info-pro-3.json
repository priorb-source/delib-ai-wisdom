    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from the other two forecasters and found the deliberation highly valuable. My initial forecast of 10% was too pessimistic, overly anchored on the sharp year-over-year decline in destinations and the short timeframe for recovery. \n\nForecaster 2 provided the most compelling analysis. Their key contributions were: (1) presenting nuanced Q1 2025 traffic data showing that while overall traffic was down, arrivals were up, suggesting resilient diaspora demand; (2) identifying the primary mechanism for a potential increase—seasonal leisure routes from Turkish, Greek, and Egyptian carriers; and (3) adding a specific negative factor I had missed—new security measures potentially curbing Iranian routes. Their conclusion that the final number will likely be close to the threshold (in the high 40s to 50) is very plausible and provides a strong basis for a probability in the 30-40% range.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis, at 58%, was based on a premise I cannot verify from the provided information: that 'at least 6-7 new routes or service resumptions are confirmed for May-July 2025'. Without access to this specific data, their high confidence seems unsubstantiated. While the logic is sound if the premise is true, I must base my forecast on the shared evidence. Therefore, I find their forecast less convincing.\n\nOverall, Forecaster 2’s balanced perspective has convinced me to substantially revise my forecast upwards.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was too low. I failed to adequately consider the counter-balancing factors against the negative security environment. Forecaster 2 correctly pointed out the resilience of diaspora-driven travel (evidenced by rising arrivals in Q1 2025) and the likelihood of seasonal summer routes being added, even if major legacy carriers remain on the sidelines. These seasonal additions are the most plausible path to increasing the destination count from the current 39.\n\nHowever, reaching 52 or more destinations in the roughly six weeks remaining is a high bar, requiring a net increase of at least 13. While seasonal adds might contribute 5-8 destinations, this is likely offset by some downside, such as the new restrictions on Iranian flights mentioned by Forecaster 2. A full recovery would almost certainly require the return of major European or Gulf carriers (like Lufthansa Group, Saudia, or Qatar Airways), which seems unlikely without a significant and lasting de-escalation in regional tensions—an event for which there is currently no strong signal.\n\nTherefore, I am updating my forecast significantly, moving from 10% to 38%. This new figure reflects the very real possibility that a combination of resilient demand and seasonal scheduling could push the number of destinations close to the threshold. However, it maintains that crossing the threshold remains the less likely outcome given the short timeframe and the persistent security risks that are keeping larger, risk-averse airlines away.",
