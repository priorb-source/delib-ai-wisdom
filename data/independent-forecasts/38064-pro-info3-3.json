  "information": "It is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days. The outcome will be known on June 12, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Scheduled corporate annual meetings for major public companies typically proceed as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The meeting is postponed due to a technical failure. Learning from 2024, an even larger number of retail shareholders attempt to log in, and the company's upgraded infrastructure still fails under the unprecedented load, forcing an adjournment to a later date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having learned its lesson from the 2024 meeting's collapse, GameStop contracts with a top-tier virtual meeting provider and conducts extensive load testing. The meeting on June 12 proceeds smoothly and completes without interruption.",
    "rationale": "The baseline assumption is that a scheduled annual meeting will occur as planned. This is a standard, legally-required corporate governance event, and the status quo holds significant weight. The primary risk factor is a repeat of the 2024 server crash. However, the 2024 failure serves as a powerful lesson and a stress test. Both GameStop's management and their chosen vendors are now acutely aware of the potential for extreme shareholder interest and have had a full year to prepare. The reputational cost of a second consecutive failure would be very high, creating a strong incentive to over-prepare and invest in robust infrastructure. The research indicating that technical failures are not common for large-cap companies supports this, suggesting the 2024 event was an outlier that the company will be heavily motivated to correct. A secondary risk is a deliberate adjournment for strategic reasons, as my assistant noted GameStop has done previously. This is a possibility if a key vote is not going the board's way, but it is a less common event than a standard meeting. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 88% because the 2024 event demonstrates a specific, proven vulnerability. The unique nature of GameStop's shareholder base makes it an outlier, and predicting server load for such an audience remains challenging. A deliberate adjournment also remains a small but non-zero possibility. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the incentive to prevent a repeat failure is immense. Basic corporate competence dictates that a known, high-profile problem from the previous year will be the top priority to fix. The status quo for such events is overwhelmingly that they proceed as scheduled. \n\nI would increase my forecast if GameStop were to issue a press release detailing their enhanced technical preparations or partnership with a market-leading virtual meeting provider. I would decrease my forecast if reports emerged of technical glitches on the meeting portal prior to the event, or if a highly contentious shareholder proposal began to gain significant momentum against the board's recommendation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason.

The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
