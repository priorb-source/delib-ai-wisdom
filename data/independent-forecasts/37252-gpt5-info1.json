  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — unless the Global Protest Tracker adds a new South Korea entry with a start date after the question’s launch and before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests continue but are smaller, routine, or treated as a continuation of late-2024 unrest; the June 3 snap presidential election proceeds without large contentious mobilizations; the Global Protest Tracker does not create a new South Korea entry starting after the launch date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A fresh, clearly delineated protest wave of 10,000+ begins in May or June (e.g., a large union-led rally/strike, weekend mass demonstrations around the election, or a post-election dispute) and the Global Protest Tracker lists it as a new entry with that start date.",
    "rationale": "Context: Per the research assistant, South Korea has been politically turbulent: martial law in Dec 2024, impeachment upheld on Apr 4, 2025, and a snap presidential election set for Jun 3, 2025. These are classic triggers for large-scale mobilization. However, the resolution depends on the Carnegie Global Protest Tracker (GPT) adding a protest with a start date after the question’s launch and before Jul 1, 2025. GPT typically catalogs major protest waves rather than every large rally, and it may regard current mobilizations as part of the late-2024 wave unless a distinct new phase clearly begins. Reasons for Yes: South Korea has a history of very large protests; election-period dynamics and possible disputes could catalyze 10k+ demonstrations; unions (e.g., KCTU) can mobilize at scale; sudden scandals or security incidents could trigger mass rallies. Reasons for No (status quo bias): After impeachment resolution and with an imminent election, tensions could diffuse into normal campaigning; large campaign events are not necessarily ‘protests’; GPT might not deem any May–June mobilizations distinct enough to merit a new entry; even if big protests occur, GPT may frame them as a continuation of Dec 2024 unrest. Why not higher: The requirement for a new GPT entry with a fresh start date narrows the pathway; post-impeachment de-escalation is plausible; GPT’s curation is selective. Why not lower: The election timing, ongoing investigations into former President Yoon, and South Korea’s capacity for rapid mass mobilization keep the door open to a large, distinct protest wave. What would move me up: Credible reports of planned or actual ≥10k demonstrations in May/June tied to a new issue frame (e.g., election irregularities, a union general strike) and signs GPT is treating it as a new episode. What would move me down: Calm campaign period, absence of ≥10k protests, or indications GPT consolidates any new rallies under the 2024 protest entry rather than opening a new one.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSouth Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
