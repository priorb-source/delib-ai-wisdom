  "information": "A recent parliamentary by-election in Wellingborough, located within the West Northamptonshire council area, saw a swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party. The 2025 election will be contested on new electoral boundaries. Political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice has predicted that nationally, Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats in the May 2025 local elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~11–12 days until polls (2 May 2025) and ~12–13 days until initial results overnight into 3 May",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Conservatives remain the largest group in West Northamptonshire after the election",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour wins the most seats by sweeping most Northampton town wards and nicking a few suburban/rural marginals, while Reform UK and Lib Dems split the right-of-centre vote in enough multi-member wards to push Conservatives into second place overall",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives retain pluralities across most rural/suburban wards and hold a handful of Northampton wards; Reform fields limited slates and underperforms, and opposition vote remains fragmented, leaving the Conservatives as the largest group (possibly without an outright majority)",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: At the last all-out election in 2021, the Conservatives won a large majority on West Northamptonshire Council. Structural geography still favors them: rural/suburban areas (ex-Daventry and South Northants) are generally Conservative-leaning, while Labour’s strength is concentrated in Northampton town. All else equal, that tends to yield more Conservative seats than Labour in a fragmented multi-party field.\n\n- What’s changed: National polling now strongly favors Labour, and local elections typically punish governing parties. New ward boundaries add uncertainty and could rebalance representation somewhat toward urban areas. Reform UK’s presence could siphon Conservative votes in rural wards. These factors point to significant Conservative losses and a plausible shift to No Overall Control.\n\n- Weighting evidence:\n  • Geography/incumbency advantage (pro-Conservative): Even with a large national swing, Conservatives often remain largest in mixed urban-rural unitaries because rural wards return multiple Conservatives and opposition votes split among Labour/Lib Dem/Green. This keeps the prior as “Con largest,” albeit reduced.\n  • National headwinds (anti-Conservative): Current national polling implies a large swing against the Conservatives. If replicated locally, Labour could dominate Northampton wards and pick up a few additional seats, especially if tactical voting emerges in edge suburbs.\n  • Reform UK: Professor Curtice’s suggestion that Reform could win many council seats underscores right-of-centre fragmentation risk. However, Reform’s local ground game and candidate coverage have historically been thin; their main impact may be to split votes rather than win many seats. That still harms Conservatives’ seat count and raises the chance Labour becomes largest.\n  • By-election signal: The cited Wellingborough by-election swing is consistent with anti-Conservative momentum in Northamptonshire overall, but note Wellingborough is in North Northamptonshire, not West Northamptonshire. It’s a relevant regional sentiment indicator but should be down-weighted as it’s not within this authority.\n  • Boundary changes: New boundaries increase variance. If they increase the share of seats in Northampton or redraw marginal areas unfavorably for Conservatives, that boosts Labour’s path to being the largest group. Lack of precise ward-by-ward notional estimates limits confidence.\n\n- Why not higher than this: Severe national headwinds, possible Reform vote-splitting, and new boundaries make it credibly possible that Labour overtakes the Conservatives in total seats, especially if anti-Conservative tactical voting coalesces in multi-member wards.\n\n- Why not lower than this: The structural rural advantage and the 2021 baseline majority imply a high hurdle for Labour to surpass Conservatives in total seats in a single cycle, even with a large swing. Fragmentation among Labour/Lib Dem/Green outside the town can leave Conservatives leading seat totals without a majority.\n\n- What would move me up (toward Yes): Evidence that Reform’s candidate coverage is sparse across rural wards; indications that Lib Dems and Greens are not fielding full slates or are focusing narrowly; credible local canvass returns showing Conservatives holding up in South Northants/Daventry; notional ward estimates under new boundaries still showing Conservatives ahead in most non-Northampton wards.\n\n- What would move me down (toward No): Confirmation that the new boundaries significantly increase Northampton-weighted seats; strong opposition candidate coverage and signs of tactical coordination in peri-urban wards; local polling/by-elections in West Northants showing large Labour swings; evidence Reform is fielding broad slates in rural areas and polling in double digits locally.",
