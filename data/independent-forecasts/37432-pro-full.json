  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification is enacted, and Ohio's existing voter registration and identification laws remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legislative session concludes before the relevant bills, such as SB 153, can successfully pass both the House and Senate. The bill stalls due to internal disagreement within the Republican caucus, similar to what led to a citizenship verification provision being removed from the transportation budget in February 2025, or due to procedural delays that cannot be overcome in the short time remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Citing national momentum and a report on non-citizens registering to vote, the Republican leadership in the Ohio General Assembly makes passing a proof-of-citizenship bill a top priority. They use their supermajority to accelerate the bill through committee and floor votes in both chambers during June, ensuring it is enacted before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability is primarily driven by three factors: the extremely short legislative timeline, recent legislative history, and the stated position of the Governor. With less than two months until the deadline, passing any piece of legislation is challenging. The most compelling piece of evidence is that in February 2025, Republicans themselves removed a similar proof-of-citizenship provision from the transportation budget. This action strongly indicates a lack of consensus within the majority party on this specific policy, a significant hurdle to overcome quickly. Furthermore, Governor Mike DeWine's reported hesitation adds another potential roadblock; while the Republican supermajority could override a veto, the threat of one can slow down or halt the legislative process. The status quo, in which legislation fails due to inertia or lack of unified support, is the most common outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% because the political will for such a law clearly exists within a faction of the powerful Republican supermajority, as evidenced by the introduction of SB 153 and the national trend in other conservative states. If legislative leadership were to prioritize this and aggressively whip votes, they have the numbers to pass it on a party-line basis in the time remaining. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 20% because the recent failure to pass a similar measure is a concrete data point suggesting the necessary internal party unity does not currently exist. The short timeline magnifies the effect of any dissent or procedural delay, making passage an unlikely event. I would increase my forecast if the bill rapidly and unanimously passed out of committee in either chamber, and I would decrease it if Governor DeWine publicly solidifies his opposition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
