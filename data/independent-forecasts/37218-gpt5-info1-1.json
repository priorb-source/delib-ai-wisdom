  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–6 weeks (around late May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is outside the U.S. or in a less convenient market, or the President’s schedule (official travel/commitments) conflicts; no marquee ally/fighter on the card; he skips the event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is a U.S. PPV in Las Vegas/Florida/New Jersey with a marquee matchup; Dana White invites and logistics align; he appears cageside or elsewhere on venue grounds.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Since 2019, Trump has attended roughly 2–4 UFC cards per year, almost exclusively U.S. events. That implies attendance at a minority of numbered cards in any given year. The research assistant notes he just attended a Miami event in April 2025 and that he historically has not attended two consecutive numbered cards within a one‑month span. UFC 315 is about four weeks later, which lowers the odds versus a typical card. Key uncertainties: location and card strength. If UFC 315 is in the U.S. (likely for most PPVs) and especially in Las Vegas with a major headliner, his close relationship with Dana White and his pattern of leveraging UFC appearances for positive reception could push odds up. Conversely, if it’s international (e.g., Abu Dhabi/Canada/Europe) or in a less convenient market, attendance becomes very unlikely. Status quo favors No: for any given card, he usually does not attend, and the short gap since his last appearance further dampens the chance. Why not higher: unknown location/card, proximity to his April appearance, and presidential scheduling constraints. Why not lower: he has an established pattern of showing up to UFC PPVs multiple times per year and strong ties to Dana White; if this is a domestic marquee PPV, attendance is plausible. Updaters: - Up if UFC 315 is confirmed Las Vegas/NY/NJ/FL and features a major star or MAGA-aligned fighter; or if White/Trump publicly hints at attending; or if the President’s schedule places him in the host city that weekend (could raise to 35–60%+). - Down if UFC 315 is international/Canada/Europe or in a less convenient U.S. market, or if official travel conflicts (could drop to 2–8%).",
