    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 week (13F due by 2025-05-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F still shows >10,000,000 AMZN shares (roughly the Q4 2024 level of ~10.7M).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire trims its AMZN position to 10,000,000 shares or fewer during Q1 2025 (e.g., a ~700k+ share reduction from ~10.7M), or exits entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire maintains its AMZN stake above 10,000,000 shares or increases it; even a modest trim that keeps the stake >10,000,000 resolves Yes under the stated criteria.",
    "rationale": "I am forecasting to the explicit resolution criterion: the Q1 2025 13F shows >10,000,000 AMZN shares. As of Q4 2024, Berkshire reported ~10.7M AMZN shares. Therefore, a Yes requires that they did not reduce the stake to 10,000,000 or below in Q1. The status quo (no change) yields a Yes. Berkshire often exhibits inertia in established positions, especially smaller ones initiated by investment lieutenants, and the AMZN stake has historically been relatively stable. That supports a higher-than-even chance of remaining above the threshold. Countervailing considerations: your assistant notes Berkshire has been a net seller for 10 consecutive quarters and built record cash (~$348B) in Q1 2025. That pattern increases the chance of incremental trims, and crossing the 10M threshold would require only a ~6–7% sale from ~10.7M. Berkshire also focused new investments on energy and Japanese trading firms, implying portfolio reshuffling could have funded those moves. These factors prevent a very high probability. Offsetting that, Berkshire did not need to sell AMZN specifically to raise cash (cash balances rose), and trimming below an arbitrary 10M line isn’t a target they would optimize around. Given the base rate of position stability, the small absolute size of the stake in Berkshire’s portfolio, and the lack of any public indication of an AMZN exit, I put more weight on inertia. Why not higher? The multi-quarter net-seller posture and the ease of crossing the 10M threshold with a modest trim. Why not lower? The prior-quarter stake already exceeds the threshold, Berkshire’s tendency to leave smaller positions unchanged, and no clear need to sell AMZN in Q1 to fund other activity. What would move me up: credible reporting or hints that Berkshire maintained or added to AMZN; signs that they focused Q1 reductions elsewhere; a 13F rumor or early filing showing unchanged counts. What would move me down: any reliable report that Berkshire trimmed AMZN in Q1, especially in the context of redeploying into energy; indications of broad-based tech trimming beyond Apple; or a pre-13F data point suggesting AMZN was among positions reduced.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
