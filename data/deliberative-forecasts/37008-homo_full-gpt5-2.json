    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my view: default is No (lapse on Apr 29), with the main Yes path via slippage or a cautious short extension to manage commissioning and enforcement. The additional point I found useful is the emphasis that if a straightforward continuation were intended, signs often surface in the final week; we’re close to that window with no signals yet. They also note Samoa’s precedent for rolling extensions (COVID), which I had implicitly considered but not stated. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and slightly strengthens the weight I place on the status quo lapse.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: the SoE was set to expire Apr 29; as of Apr 21 there’s no extension signal; temporary generators are expected by end-April, with real risk of minor commissioning or logistics delays. The government could prefer to retain emergency powers briefly to ensure compliance and procurement during the switchover. However, absent explicit hints by now, the base case is still that the SoE lapses on schedule. I’m trimming my probability modestly toward the others’ estimates to reflect the lack of extension signaling as we near expiry, while still reserving meaningful weight for a short rollover if the gensets aren’t fully online or stable by the 29th, or if fuel/logistics hiccups crop up. Tail risk of an unrelated emergency remains low but nonzero.",
