    "review": "My initial forecast of 92% was clearly overconfident, and I am making a significant downward revision based on the points raised by the other forecasters. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly compelling, introducing two key risk factors I had underweighted: 1) The mechanical risk of posting lags, where a valid sighting in June might not appear on the website by the July 1st resolution date, and 2) The explicit framing of 'Cube' as an uncommon descriptor, where randomness could easily result in a zero-report month. Forecaster 3's focus on the word 'rare' in the prompt correctly highlights that cube sightings are not a daily occurrence, and challenged my initial assumption that at least one report was nearly guaranteed. While my forecast remains higher than theirs, their arguments have convinced me to move from near-certainty to a more moderate position that better accounts for randomness and procedural risks.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I have substantially lowered my forecast from 92%. My initial confidence was based on the fact that 'Cube' is an active category and that some months see multiple reports, making a single report seem highly probable. However, the other forecasters correctly identified weaknesses in this view.\n\n1.  **Base Rate Reassessment:** Forecaster 3's focus on the 'rarity' of cube sightings, while perhaps leading to an overly pessimistic forecast, rightly suggests that months with zero cube reports are a distinct possibility. A review of NUFORC's recent monthly reports confirms this: while most months do contain at least one 'Cube' sighting, there are occasional months with none. This indicates the true base rate is likely in the 75-85% range, not the 95%+ I had implicitly assumed.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Risk:** Forecaster 2’s point about posting lag is crucial. The resolution criteria are strict. A report from late June might not be processed and posted by July 1. This mechanical risk directly reduces the probability of a 'Yes' resolution and was a significant blind spot in my initial analysis.\n\n3.  **Seasonality:** I agree with Forecaster 2 that the summer month of June should see a higher volume of total reports due to more people being outdoors, which slightly increases the probability of any given shape, including 'Cube', being reported. This serves as a slight counterweight to the risks.\n\nMy new forecast of 78% is an integration of these points. It starts from a revised, data-informed base rate of ~80-85% for a month having a cube sighting, adds a slight positive adjustment for seasonality in June, and then applies a discount for the mechanical risk of posting lags. I remain higher than the other forecasters because I believe they are underweighting the historical frequency; a zero-cube month appears to be the exception rather than a common outcome, making a forecast in the 55-60% range seem too low.",
