    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (ceremony expected Monday, June 9, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — a man wins Outstanding Chef",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any of the male finalists is selected as Outstanding Chef by the Beard Awards voting body.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cassie Piuma (Sarma, Somerville, MA) wins the 2025 Outstanding Chef award.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the linked finalists list, Cassie Piuma is the only woman finalist in the national Outstanding Chef category. Other women mentioned by the research assistant are finalists in regional Best Chef categories, which do not affect this question.\n- Base rates/status quo: In recent years (2022–2024), Outstanding Chef has gone to men. Historically, women do win this award, but less frequently than men. With a typical field of five finalists and only one woman in the group, a neutral, symmetry-based starting point would be ~20%.\n- Adjustments upward: The James Beard Foundation has emphasized diversity and equity in recent cycles, and Piuma leads a widely acclaimed restaurant (Sarma) with strong national recognition. With no intra-gender vote-splitting among women (since she appears to be the only woman finalist), her path is cleaner if she is a consensus second choice among many voters.\n- Adjustments downward: The majority of the finalist field is male, and the award often recognizes multi-year national impact and momentum; if one or more male finalists are perceived as overdue or consensus frontrunners, that depresses Piuma’s chances. Recent winners being male does not by itself force a correction this year.\n- Net: I place extra weight on the status quo (male winners are more common; only one woman finalist). I nudge slightly above the naive 20% to reflect Sarma/Piuma’s strong profile and the Foundation’s recent values, but I stay below one-in-three absent concrete signals that she’s a frontrunner.\n- What would move me up: Credible pre-ceremony reporting or judge chatter suggesting Piuma is the consensus pick; major spotlight features framing her as the favorite; late-breaking controversies or momentum shifts disadvantaging male finalists.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that several male finalists are widely viewed as overdue/frontrunners; negative press for Sarma/Piuma; additional intel that multiple judges favor a specific male candidate.",
