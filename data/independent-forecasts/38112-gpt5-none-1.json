    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 2025-07-08 00:00 in Rio de Janeiro’s time, assuming the summit is July 6–7)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Member states emphasize consolidation and the new partner framework, citing the need to operationalize coordination with the 2024 partner cohort and onboard Indonesia (Jan 2025) before further expansion. India (and possibly Brazil) prefer caution; disagreements over candidates (e.g., Belarus, Turkey, Cuba) prevent unanimity, so no new full-member invitations are issued at or before the summit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BRICS builds on momentum from Indonesia’s January 2025 accession and announces at least one additional full-member invitation—most plausibly upgrading a broadly acceptable partner such as Nigeria, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, or Thailand—either shortly before or during the Rio summit, with all current members agreeing. The move is framed as balanced, non-confrontational expansion aligned with the partner-to-member pathway.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: After the large 2023 expansion, BRICS created a partner tier in 2024 to slow and structure growth. Indonesia’s quick move from partner to full member in Jan 2025 shows the pipeline can work and that off-summit invitations are possible, modestly raising the odds of at least one more admission in 2025.\n\nFor a Yes: China and Russia continue to push expansion; Brazil under Lula is supportive of Global South leadership; several partners (e.g., Nigeria, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Malaysia/Thailand) could plausibly clear unanimity without overtly politicizing the bloc. A host-country summit often seeks a tangible deliverable; upgrading one partner to full would fit.\n\nFor a No: Unanimity now requires 10 members, increasing veto points. India has been cautious about rapid expansion and may resist politically sensitive candidates (Belarus, Cuba, Turkey). Brazil may prioritize institutional consolidation and concrete economic deliverables over more membership headlines—especially with Saudi Arabia’s prior invitation still unresolved in terms of acceptance (even though that acceptance is irrelevant to this question’s resolution). Having already admitted Indonesia in 2025 could reduce appetite for a second addition before/at the summit.\n\nWeighting: The status quo (no fresh invitation) deserves meaningful weight given the unanimity requirement and the recent creation of the partner track explicitly designed to manage expansion pressure. Countervailing that is the visible pro-expansion momentum since 2023 and the existence of a prepared partner queue from which a consensus pick could be drawn.\n\nWhy not higher: Multiple veto players, India’s prudence, and the possibility that leadership opts for consolidation after the Indonesia move this year.\n\nWhy not lower: Clear expansionary trajectory since 2023, an established partner pipeline, and a host-country summit incentive to announce at least one high-consensus addition (e.g., Nigeria or Algeria) make a fresh invitation plausible.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible pre-summit leaks or joint statements from Brazil/India/China naming or strongly signaling specific candidates; partner-country heads of state attending with language about imminent accession; Sherpa communiqués referencing criteria being met.\n\nWhat would move me down: Reporting that India/Brazil prefer a pause; agenda documents emphasizing only partner engagement with no membership items; signs of intra-bloc disagreement over candidate lists; indications that the summit’s political bandwidth is consumed by other priorities.\n\nResearch assistant: No additional information provided beyond the prompt’s background.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
