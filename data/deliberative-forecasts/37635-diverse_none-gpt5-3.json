    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: short horizon, 7‑day rolling average inertia, and the tie-resolves-No bias. F2 adds a clear emphasis on Milei’s higher variance and the fragility of a 1‑point edge; I agree this should slightly drag a Yes probability toward 50. F3 mirrors my baseline, though they slightly misstated Sheinbaum’s start date; that doesn’t materially change the stability/volatility contrast. Neither brings fundamentally new evidence, but F2’s emphasis on variance and the tie penalty nudges me a bit lower than my initial call.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~6 weeks from resolution and Morning Consult’s smoothing makes large swings less likely, so status quo marginally favors Yes. However, the 1‑point gap is within normal week-to-week noise, and ties resolve as No, which slightly biases against Yes. Milei’s approval has been more event-sensitive; with even modest volatility over several weeks, the chance of a tie or small reversal is non-trivial. Given this, I’m trimming my prior 57% down a touch to better reflect the tie penalty and Milei’s higher variance. I’d move up if Milei opens a consistent 2–3 point lead by mid-June; I’d move down if we see even one week of parity or Sheinbaum edging ahead, given rounding risk near the check date.",
