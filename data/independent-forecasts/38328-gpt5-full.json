  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until resolution (window for qualifying announcements: June 10–30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — at least one MEP announces a resignation in the June 10–30 window under normal churn, with possible added pressure from the Huawei probe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Implicated MEPs refuse to step down despite immunity waivers; no mid-June cabinet appointments or reshuffles pull sitting MEPs into national roles; no health/personal exits occur, yielding zero resignation announcements between June 10 and June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following mid-June Committee on Legal Affairs and plenary immunity votes, an implicated MEP (e.g., Martusciello or one of the four under request) resigns; or a national government formation (e.g., Belgium, Portugal, Netherlands) appoints an MEP to a cabinet post, prompting a late-June resignation announcement.",
    "rationale": "Baseline turnover: Historically, 80–120 replacements in a five-year, 705-seat Parliament implies roughly 1–2 departures per month. Over a 21-day window (June 10–30), a Poisson framing with λ≈1.0–1.3 yields a 60–70% chance of at least one resignation, even without shocks. Early in a term, turnover tends to be a bit higher, nudging the baseline up. Scandal dynamics: Belgian prosecutors’ probe tied to Huawei and the June 5 arrest of EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello raise short-term risk. At least four additional immunity waivers have been requested; JURI was expected to vote mid-June, with plenary confirmation June 16–19. Major groups (EPP, S&D, Renew) signaling zero tolerance increases pressure for a fast exit by any member whose immunity is lifted. However, Qatargate precedent shows some MEPs under investigation resisted resigning for months (e.g., Eva Kaili, Marc Tarabella), tempering how much we should bump the odds solely on legal jeopardy. Government formations: Resignations often occur when MEPs take national posts. The assistant notes potential cabinet appointments (Portugal) and fluid political situations in the Netherlands and Belgium that could lead to reshuffles in June; if timed in late June, these would fall squarely within the qualifying window. Why not higher: Qatargate-like stickiness suggests implicated members may try to hang on; appointment-driven resignations are uncertain in timing and could slip to July. The narrow, 21-day window also trims the chance relative to a full month. Why not lower: Even without scandal or reshuffles, routine churn gives a substantial base rate (>50%) for at least one resignation in a ~three-week span. The Huawei probe and potential immunity waivers in mid-June add incremental probability. What would move me up: • Confirmed JURI and plenary immunity lifts naming specific MEPs. • Public party ultimatums or credible reports that an implicated MEP will step down. • Concrete coalition deals or cabinet lists in Belgium/Portugal/Netherlands that include current MEPs, with swearing-in dates in late June. What would move me down: • Clear signals that implicated MEPs will fight on with party backing. • Slippage of immunity votes beyond late June. • Evidence that government formations are delayed to July or later.",
