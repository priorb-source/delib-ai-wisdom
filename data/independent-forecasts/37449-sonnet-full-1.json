  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 weeks (from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The US continues to criticize China's military exercises around Taiwan as provocative and coercive, but does not formally accuse China of implementing an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its pattern of military exercises that simulate blockade scenarios, while the US maintains its current rhetorical approach of calling these activities 'provocative' and 'intimidation tactics' without formally characterizing them as an actual blockade. The situation remains tense but stable, with diplomatic channels staying open as demonstrated by the April 2025 Shanghai talks. Both sides continue posturing without crossing into direct confrontation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates from exercises to implementing actual restrictions on maritime traffic to Taiwan ports - perhaps announcing a 'quarantine zone' or 'special inspection regime' that functionally blocks commercial shipping. Alternatively, China conducts such extensive and prolonged military exercises that they physically prevent ships from accessing Taiwan's seaports for an extended period, prompting the US to formally characterize this as a blockade. This could be triggered by a precipitating event such as a Taiwan independence declaration, major US arms sale announcement, or an incident during military exercises.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The research assistant's report shows that while China is actively conducting exercises that simulate blockades, the US has deliberately avoided using 'blockade' terminology in its public statements, even calling these 'regular occurrences.' Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. With only 8 weeks remaining until the resolution date, the time window for escalation is relatively short. The presence of active diplomatic talks in April 2025 suggests both sides are maintaining communication channels. The resolution criteria are specific: requiring a PUBLIC US accusation that China is BLOCKADING (not just exercising near) Taiwan's seaports. This represents a major escalatory step in rhetoric that the US has historically avoided. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) China is actively rehearsing blockade scenarios as acknowledged by US military leaders, (2) US strategic priorities are explicitly focused on preventing Chinese action against Taiwan per the upcoming NDS, (3) there's always some risk of miscalculation or inadvertent escalation during intensive military exercises, and (4) 8 weeks provides sufficient time for a crisis to develop if triggered. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: actual restrictions on shipping to Taiwan, ships being turned away from ports, or a major triggering event. For me to update lower, I would need: increased diplomatic engagement, scaled-back exercises, or approaching July 1 without incident.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
