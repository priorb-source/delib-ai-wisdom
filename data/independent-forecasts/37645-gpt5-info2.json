  "information": "In response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling SNS-led coalition quickly coalesces around a new prime minister, the Assembly confirms a new cabinet, and no election date is set before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Vučić decides not to form another cabinet, dissolves the Assembly, and announces a parliamentary election date for late summer/early autumn (e.g., August/September), with the announcement made before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The PM’s resignation in January put early elections on the table. The president has twice said a decision would come “within ten days,” most recently on May 14, signaling a near-term choice between forming a new cabinet or going to the polls. At the same time, senior officials insist the coalition retains a “stable majority,” arguing there’s no need for early elections. \n- Status quo weighting: With only ~1.5 months left, the default is that no announcement occurs unless the leadership actively opts for snap polls. Serbia’s institutions allow a new cabinet without elections if the majority holds—consistent with officials’ claims—so the status quo favors No.\n- Reasons for Yes being plausible: (1) Serbia has a strong recent pattern of snap parliamentary elections (2014, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023), showing a leadership willing to reset the political clock. (2) The PM’s resignation provides a clean trigger to justify new elections. (3) A summer/early autumn election could be tactically attractive (lower-turnout dynamics, agenda control). (4) Vučić’s public “decision within ten days” framing suggests a genuine, near-term fork.\n- Reasons for No being more likely: (1) Officials emphasize a stable majority; if they can agree on a PM-designate, they can avoid elections. (2) Election fatigue after December 2023 and potential international scrutiny may make immediate snap polls less appealing. (3) A summer election can carry logistical/political risks; if the coalition is confident it can govern, it may prefer continuity. (4) The repetition of “within ten days” could signal brinkmanship or stalling rather than a firm tilt to dissolution.\n- Legal/timing considerations: If elections are called, Serbian rules typically place election day 45–60 days after the call; thus, an announcement in late May or June would plausibly set a vote in August or September. That timing is workable but not costless, reinforcing that this is a discretionary political choice rather than a forced one.\n- Why not higher: Clear statements about a stable parliamentary majority and an obvious, low-friction alternative—forming a new government—keep the base case at No. The short time window also means any slippage in the decision process quickly runs into July without an announcement.\n- Why not lower: The PM’s resignation plus Serbia’s frequent resort to snap elections, and Vučić’s repeated signaling of an imminent decision, all elevate the odds above a low single-digit baseline.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports that coalition talks are stalling; public signals from Vučić or SNS that elections are the preferred option; procedural steps toward dissolving the Assembly; polling showing a clear advantage for SNS that they might wish to lock in; escalating protests/crises requiring renewed legitimacy.\n- What would move me down: Announcement of a PM-designate with visible coalition backing; a successful parliamentary vote installing a new cabinet; explicit statements ruling out early elections until 2026 or until the normal term end.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
