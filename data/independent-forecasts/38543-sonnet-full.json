  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump has not visited China and currently has no announced plans to do so before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump does not visit China in the remaining 16 days. The meeting with Xi that was agreed upon on June 11 is scheduled for after July 1, 2025, allowing sufficient time for the extensive logistical and security preparations that historically accompany US presidential visits to China. Trump attends his scheduled G7 and NATO summits, and any China visit is planned for later in the summer or fall.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump makes a surprise quick visit to China in one of the narrow windows available - either June 19-23 (between G7 and NATO) or June 26-30 (after NATO). Given the urgency of finalizing the trade deal before the July 9 tariff deadline, both leaders agree to an expedited meeting with minimal advance preparation. This would be unprecedented in its speed but not impossible given the high stakes.",
    "rationale": "The window for this question to resolve as Yes is extremely narrow - only 16 days remain. Trump has two major international commitments already scheduled: the G7 Summit (June 16-18) and NATO Summit (June 24-25), which consume most of the available time. This leaves only two possible windows: June 19-23 (5 days) or June 26-30 (5 days).\n\nThe critical negative indicator is the complete absence of preparation signals. The research indicates that US presidential visits to China historically require extensive logistical and security preparations beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there are no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations underway. This is a strong signal against a near-term visit.\n\nOn the positive side, Trump did announce on June 11 that he and Xi agreed to meet in person, and China officially extended an invitation. The finalization of a trade framework and the looming July 9 tariff deadline create genuine urgency for an in-person meeting. Additionally, Xi will be traveling to Kazakhstan concurrently with Trump's G7attendance, showing both leaders are internationally mobile.\n\nHowever, the base rate strongly favors No. Major diplomatic visits of this nature simply don't materialize in 16 days without visible preparation. While Trump has a history of unconventional moves and surprise announcements, the logistical reality of presidential security and bilateral coordination makes an impromptu visit highly unlikely.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) no preparation indicators are visible, (2) the timeline is exceptionally compressed, (3) Trump's schedule is already full with major summits, and (4) no specific date/location has been announced despite the June 11 agreement.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) a genuine invitation and acceptance exist, (2) there is real urgency around the trade deal, (3) surprise visits, while rare, are theoretically possible, and (4) sufficient calendar days technically remain.\n\nI would update significantly higher if: advance security teams are reported in China, a specific date is announced for before July 1, or Trump cancels/reschedules other commitments. I would update lower if: more days pass without preparation signs, or any statement indicates the meeting will occur after July 1.",
