  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SB 3 stalls or is diluted in the Texas House (e.g., replaced with age limits/testing rules), the session adjourns without a full retail ban, no June special session is called or it fails to pass a full ban, or the governor lets a bill become law without his signature (which would not resolve this question as Yes).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The House State Affairs Committee quickly advances SB 3 (or similar language), the House passes a full retail THC sales ban, the Senate concurs on any changes, and Governor Abbott signs it by mid-June (post–sine die signing window) or during a June special session before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The default is No—major policy changes usually fail late in session, and Texas has repeatedly struggled to enact a broad THC/hemp crackdown via statute.\n\nWhat we know (from the assistant’s report and public context):\n- The Senate passed SB 3 on May 7 (25–6) to ban nearly all THC outside the limited medical program; it’s in the House State Affairs Committee. Lt. Gov. Patrick strongly supports it and has threatened to push for a special session if it doesn’t pass.\n- Time is short: regular session adjourns late May; the House has tight deadlines and a heavy calendar. The House has historically been more skeptical of sweeping bans on hemp-derived THC products, with the hemp industry lobbying hard. If the House amends the bill to a partial restriction (e.g., age limits), it would not meet the question’s “full prohibition” criterion.\n- If a bill passes in the final days, the governor can still sign it up to 20 days after adjournment (roughly by mid‑June), which is within the question’s window. Only the governor can call a special session; Patrick’s pressure doesn’t guarantee one. Abbott’s willingness to call and prioritize a THC ban in June is uncertain given competing priorities.\n\nKey adjudication assumption: I assume a law that bans general/retail sale of THC products while preserving the existing, limited medical program would count as a “full prohibition” for this question (since that’s what SB 3 targets). If the adjudicator requires zero legal sales anywhere (including the medical program), the probability drops sharply (≈5%).\n\nWhy not higher: Despite Senate passage and leadership pressure, the House path is narrow and time‑constrained; the House has been the graveyard for past bans and may prefer partial measures, which wouldn’t count. Also, even if a bill passes, there’s a small chance Abbott allows it to become law without signing, which would not resolve Yes per the stated criterion.\n\nWhy not lower: The Senate’s strong vote, Patrick’s prioritization, and the possibility of a quick committee move plus a mid‑June gubernatorial signature keep a non‑trivial path to passage. A June special session, while uncertain, provides an additional path.\n\nWhat would move me up:\n- Immediate House State Affairs hearing set and favorable signals from House leadership/Calendars.\n- Public commitment from Abbott to sign a THC sales ban or to call a June special session specifically for this.\n- Industry/lobby signals indicating they expect a full ban to pass.\n\nWhat would move me down:\n- Missed House deadlines, no committee movement within the next week.\n- Clear signs the House will only consider partial restrictions.\n- Abbott indicating no special session or lack of interest in this issue before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
