  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Rockies remain last in MLB winning percentage on June 15.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies go on an extended hot streak (e.g., ~.500+ over the next ~24 games) while a current bottom-5 team (e.g., White Sox, A’s, Marlins, Nationals) suffers an extreme losing skid large enough to push their cumulative winning percentage below the Rockies’ by June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to play poorly (even ~.300 ball) and no other team collapses enough to undercut their already massive deficit; ties for lowest WP% would also satisfy “have the lowest” in common interpretation.",
    "rationale": "- What we know now (May 19, 2025): Rockies are 8-38 (.174) with a -128 run differential and worst-in-MLB pitching and hitting metrics; next-worst team is ~.286 — a 112-point gap. Managerial change just happened; they won May 18, but the schedule to mid-June is strong.\n- Status quo weight: With only ~3.5 weeks (~23–26 games) until June 15, it is very hard for any other team to erase a >.100 WPct gap in cumulative standings unless two things occur simultaneously: the Rockies play near or above .500 while a contender for worst plays at or near a historic losing pace.\n- Back-of-envelope thresholds: If the Rockies go 6–18 (.250) in their next 24, they’d be 14–70 (.200). For the White Sox starting around 14–35 (.286) to finish below .200 by June 15, they would need roughly 22+ consecutive losses with the Rockies not improving much. Even a 0–24 Sox stretch only drops them to ~.192–.205 depending on exact games — and that’s an extreme, highly improbable run. Similar math applies to other bottom teams that already start far ahead of Colorado.\n- Regression and talent: Preseason PECOTA had the Rockies ~.343, but their current performance and peripherals are historically poor, and upcoming opponents are strong. A sustained .500 stretch by June 15 is possible but low probability; a catastrophic counterpart skid by another club of the necessary magnitude is even less likely.\n- Why not higher than this forecast? Baseball is volatile over short windows; managerial changes, returning players (e.g., Tovar), and small-sample streaks can produce surprising 10–15 game runs. If the Rockies play .500+ for the next ~20–25 games while, say, the White Sox or another bottom club goes ~.150, the gap can narrow fast.\n- Why not lower? The current gap (.174 vs ~.286) is enormous given the limited time. It would typically require a rare, near-worst-case losing streak for a competitor plus a moderate improvement from Colorado to flip.\n- What would move me up? Continued Rockies futility (≤.300 over the next 10–12 games) combined with other bottom teams playing ~.400. What would move me down? A Rockies heater (e.g., 6–2 or better in the next 8) alongside a concurrent 2–10 stretch by another cellar team, shrinking the gap materially.\n- RA highlights used: Rockies’ 8–38 start (.174), worst-in-MLB pitching/hitting metrics, -128 run differential, managerial change, and that the next-worst team sat ~.286 — all point to a very high likelihood they remain last by mid-June.",
