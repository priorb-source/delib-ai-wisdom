    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents critically important recent data that I lacked: specific monthly reporting numbers showing all months in 2023 exceeded 600, all 2024 months exceeded 450, and 2025 months averaged 517. If accurate, this completely contradicts my assumption that the historical 50-year average (~300/month) was representative of current conditions. Forecaster 2's claim that every single month for 28+ consecutive months exceeded 400 is powerful evidence. Forecaster 3 appears to lack this recent data and works from historical averages similar to my initial approach, arriving at 58%. The key difference is whether recent reporting has dramatically increased from historical norms. Forecaster 2's specific numbers (June 2020: 470, June 2021: 407, June 2022: 603) and consistency claim are either highly informative or incorrect. If true, they indicate a structural shift in reporting rates beginning around 2020, possibly due to Congressional legitimization of UAP topics and media attention. This would make 400 a relatively low bar rather than 33% above baseline.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 38% was based on comparing 400 to a historical average of ~300/month. However, Forecaster 2's detailed recent data suggests reporting rates have increased dramatically since 2020, with recent months consistently in the 450-600+ range. If every month from 2023-2025 has exceeded 400 (with only 4-5 exceptions in 28+ months), then June 2025 exceeding 400 becomes highly probable rather than uncertain. The pattern Forecaster 2 describes - 2025 averaging 517 per month - provides a 29% buffer above the 400 threshold. For June to fail would require a significant departure from an established trend. I'm updating substantially upward but not to 87% because: (1) I cannot independently verify these specific numbers, (2) the question may be targeting an edge case or potential shift, (3) modest uncertainty is warranted for any forecast. However, the consistency and specificity of Forecaster 2's data is compelling enough to justify a major revision from my initial 38%.",
