  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to watch the field and work on his centrist party infrastructure without declaring for governor; he signals interest but holds off, consistent with his past cycles and stated plan for a brief, late campaign.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan decides to pair the launch of his new party with a high-profile gubernatorial announcement in June to seize media attention amid new entrants (e.g., Jolly) and to frame the race early as a centrist alternative.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: With only a few weeks left, large behavioral shifts are less likely. Morgan himself told Politico he would observe the field first and, if he ran, would favor a short (~3-month) campaign—implying a much later start than mid-2025.\n- Track record: He publicly flirted with runs in 2018 and 2022 but didn’t enter, which modestly lowers the base rate for a near-term announcement.\n- Field dynamics: Since June 5, David Jolly entered the Democratic primary; Jason Pizzo plans an independent run; Byron Donalds is in on the GOP side; Casey DeSantis is considering. These developments give Morgan more to watch rather than forcing immediate action. They do not create a clear, urgent window that requires a June announcement.\n- Party-building: Morgan is advancing a new centrist party (reported Feb/May 2025). While launching a party could be paired with a candidacy declaration, he can also build brand and infrastructure without committing. Florida’s 2026 timelines (candidate qualifying typically mid-2026) don’t compel a June 2025 declaration.\nWhy not higher: The status quo strongly favors waiting; his stated preference for a brief campaign and his history of non-entry both point toward no announcement in the next three weeks.\nWhy not lower: He is actively engaged, wealthy enough to self-fund, enjoys media moments, and a party launch could be amplified by declaring a candidacy. That keeps a non-trivial chance alive.\nWhat would move me up: Concrete signs of ramp-up (hiring campaign staff, scheduling a major announcement, filing or forming a candidate-specific committee, coordinated media buys, formal party launch with candidate language). A surprise move by a top-tier rival (e.g., Casey DeSantis definitively bowing out or in) that Morgan frames as creating an opening, combined with visible operational steps.\nWhat would move me down: Explicit public statements from Morgan delaying any decision until later in 2025/2026, no movement on the party launch this month, or credible reporting that he’s ruled out a 2026 run.",
