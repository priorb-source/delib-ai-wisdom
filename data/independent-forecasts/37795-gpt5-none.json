    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — most individual teams are not the single worst by winning percentage on a given date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more other bottom-tier clubs (e.g., White Sox, Athletics, Marlins, Angels, Nationals) underperform the Rockies through mid‑June, leaving the Rockies second-worst or better, or tied but not shown as solely last depending on how MLB’s standings page orders ties when an admin checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to perform as a bottom-tier team and either remain or slip to the worst winning percentage by June 15, possibly via a short losing streak or unfavorable series vs. stronger NL West opponents; ties for worst may also count depending on how MLB’s page presents them when checked.",
    "rationale": "- Set-up and priors: Without live standings, I lean on preseason/base-rate information. The Rockies were broadly expected to be among MLB’s weakest teams in 2025 by public projection systems, placing them in the bottom cluster of candidates for worst record by mid‑June. Competitors for the basement likely include the White Sox, Athletics, Marlins, Angels, and possibly the Nationals. \n- Short horizon: From May 19 to June 15 there are roughly 25–28 games. By mid‑June, teams will have played ~65–75 games, so the distribution of winning percentages has already spread out. Movement is possible but large swings are less common over a few weeks, which means whoever is already in the bottom mix is most likely to remain there. \n- Status quo weighting: The default outcome for any single team being uniquely worst on a specific date is No, because multiple teams are plausible basement dwellers. If there are about 5–6 realistic candidates, an equal-share baseline would be ~17%–20% for any one of them; the Rockies may merit a slight premium above equiprobable because of true-talent concerns and a tough division, but not dramatically higher without evidence they’re currently dead last. \n- Ties/edge cases: If MLB’s page shows a tie for lowest winning percentage, this may resolve Yes if the Rockies share that lowest percentage. That slightly lifts the probability. Conversely, ordering quirks or timing of the admin check could cut the other way. \n- Why not higher? I don’t have confirmation that the Rockies are currently worst or clearly separated from peers; several other teams are credible candidates to occupy the bottom slot by June 15. \n- Why not lower? The Rockies’ underlying quality and schedule context keep them solidly in the bottom-tier cohort, making it plausible they end up worst on that snapshot date. \n- What would move me up? Evidence the Rockies are currently last or within a game of last with poor recent form; injuries to key players; a particularly tough schedule stretch to June 15; or competitors showing modest improvement. \n- What would move me down? Evidence the Rockies are several games clear of last place today, improving performance, or a bottom competitor (e.g., White Sox or A’s) is significantly worse or has an especially rough schedule.\n- Research assistant: No additional information was available, so I did not incorporate live standings; this keeps the estimate closer to a prior-driven, cluster-based probability rather than an information-weighted one.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
