    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current government, despite the Prime Minister's resignation, attempts to form a new government with the existing parliamentary majority, avoiding the need to call a new general election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its coalition partners decide to nominate a new Prime Minister. They successfully form a new government, or engage in prolonged negotiations that extend beyond the July 1 deadline, thus avoiding an official announcement of a new election within the specified timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the Prime Minister's resignation, the political instability is deemed too great to resolve without a new mandate from the electorate. President Aleksandar Vučić or the acting government decides that a snap election is the best strategic option and officially announces a date for the election before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is the political fallout from the Prime Minister's resignation, a significant event that fundamentally disrupts the status quo. The provided article explicitly links this resignation to the possibility of snap elections. In parliamentary systems, a PM's resignation is a classic trigger for an early election to resolve the ensuring political crisis and seek a renewed mandate. The ruling party may see this as an opportunity to consolidate power or preempt further instability. The timeframe of six weeks is short, but more than sufficient for a political decision of this magnitude to be made and announced, especially if the resignation was a planned strategic move to force an election. I am placing a high probability on 'Yes' because the trigger event is so potent. My forecast is not higher because the ruling SNS party holds a majority and has a viable alternative: appointing a new Prime Minister from within their ranks to lead the government without dissolving parliament. President Aleksandar Vučić, as the de facto center of power, may prefer this path to avoid the costs and risks of another election campaign. Bureaucratic or political delays in making a final decision could also push any announcement past the July 1st deadline. My forecast is not lower because simply replacing the PM might not quell the underlying political tensions that led to the resignation. The pressure from opposition parties, the public, or even internal party factions for a fresh election could be overwhelming, making a snap election the most expedient path forward. I would increase my probability if there are reports of failed negotiations to form a new government or if key political leaders begin publicly advocating for an election. I would decrease my probability if a candidate for Prime Minister is quickly nominated and appears to have sufficient support within parliament for confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
