    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: caretaker norms and the 2017 Hwang precedent weigh against a run; legal/practical hurdles (likely need to resign, registration deadlines) make a last‑minute candidacy harder; absence of visible pre‑signals is telling. Forecaster 3 adds the age/tenure consideration and availability of alternative PPP figures, which mildly lowers the likelihood. Neither provided new concrete evidence of active drafting beyond the cited report, which keeps the upside bounded. Overall, their arguments are consistent and slightly nudge me downward on calibration.",
    "rationale": "Roughly 13 days remain to May 5. If a June election is indeed pending, Han would need to announce imminently and likely resign, incurring high costs and violating strong neutrality norms for an acting president. The 2017 acting‑president precedent, Han’s technocratic/non‑electoral profile and age, and the lack of public pre‑signals (organizational buildup, resignation chatter, explicit openness) all favor No. The reported PPP push to draft him keeps a non‑trivial path open—party elites could rapidly converge and press a quick announcement—but without corroborating signs, that tail remains modest. Given the alignment of the other analyses and the absence of new positive indicators, I trim my prior 27% slightly to reflect calibration toward the status‑quo‑favoring evidence.",
