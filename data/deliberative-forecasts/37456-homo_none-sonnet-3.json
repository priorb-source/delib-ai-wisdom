    "review": "All three forecasters converged on a similar 30-43% range, which suggests reasonable consensus. Forecaster 2 provides the most conservative estimate (30%), emphasizing multiple verification steps and historical patterns of recalls extending beyond 3 months. Forecaster 3 (42%) raises two excellent points I underweighted: (1) the perishable nature of liquid eggs could facilitate faster removal from commerce, and (2) the fact that 40 days have already elapsed without closure suggests this isn't following a rapid-resolution trajectory. The enumeration of required steps by Forecaster 2 (investigation, corrective actions, product recovery verification, facility re-inspection, administrative closure) is particularly valuable and reinforces the complexity of the closure process. However, I note that the claim about 'many recalls extending beyond 3 months' lacks specific citation, though the logic is sound. The convergence around strong status quo bias across all three analyses is convincing - regulatory processes generally move slowly, and we have no evidence of rapid progress.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I should update modestly downward. The strongest new argument is the combination of (a) already 40 days elapsed without closure, suggesting this isn't a streamlined case, and (b) the detailed process requirements identified by Forecaster 2. If this recall were following an expedited path, we might expect to see closure signals by now. The perishable nature argument cuts both ways: while it could facilitate faster removal, it also means the product is likely already out of commerce naturally, potentially slowing the urgency of formal closure. The 95-day total timeline remains sufficient for closure to be plausible - it's not aggressively short - but the elapsed time without resolution weakens the case for imminent closure. I'm adjusting from 43% to 38%, acknowledging stronger status quo bias while maintaining that the timeframe provides reasonable possibility of closure before July 1.",
