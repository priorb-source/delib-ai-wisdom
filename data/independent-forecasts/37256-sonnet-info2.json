  "information": "The government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - South Sudan does not ratify AfCFTA by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "South Sudan continues to be preoccupied with its multiple domestic crises including the fiscal emergency from collapsed oil revenues, political instability following senior official arrests, and preparations for December elections. The legislature continues its pattern of infrequent meetings and does not take up AfCFTA ratification. The deadline passes without action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing intense pressure from African Union partners or offered significant economic incentives, South Sudan's government convenes an emergency legislative session and fast-tracks AfCFTA ratification as a symbolic gesture of continental solidarity and commitment to regional integration, despite ongoing domestic challenges.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome given the compelling evidence against ratification within the timeframe. With only 60 days remaining, multiple factors make ratification extremely unlikely: (1) The legislature has demonstrated severe dysfunction, meeting only 32 days in the previous six-month period; (2) The published May-June 2025 calendar contains zero trade-related bills; (3) The country faces an acute fiscal crisis from the Red Sea pipeline shutdown; (4) Major political instability evidenced by the April 2025 arrest of the Vice-President and senior officials; (5) No budget allocation exists for AfCFTA obligations like tariff reductions; (6) Government focus is entirely on the delayed peace roadmap and December 2025 elections. For ratification to occur, the government would need to suddenly prioritize this issue, convene special legislative sessions, and complete the ratification process within two months - all while managing profound political and economic crises. The only scenario supporting a higher probability would be evidence of: AfCFTA appearing on the legislative agenda, explicit government prioritization statements, or visible international pressure with incentives. The only reason not to forecast even lower is a tiny tail risk that AfCFTA could be used as an unexpected symbolic political gesture or emergency international intervention could materialize. However, given the comprehensive evidence of governmental paralysis and competing priorities, even this seems implausible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
