  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is reached, and Lebanon continues to face a severe economic crisis without the framework or financial support of an IMF program.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations stall due to an inability of Lebanon's divided political leadership to agree on and commit to the prior actions required by the IMF, particularly concerning banking sector restructuring and fiscal reforms. The short timeframe proves insufficient to overcome years of political gridlock, and the deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The urgency of the economic crisis forces a political consensus in Lebanon. The current negotiations result in a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) for the proposed $3 billion Extended Fund Facility. A joint announcement is made by the IMF and Lebanese officials in mid-to-late June, meeting the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the significant positive momentum indicated by the research assistant's report. The fact that a high-level IMF mission is physically in Beirut for formal negotiations (May 29-30) with a second round already scheduled (June 10) is a strong leading indicator of serious intent. The discussion of a specific program—a 46-month, $3 billion EFF—suggests that talks have progressed beyond the preliminary stage. The optimistic statements from the Finance Minister, while potentially political, add to this positive picture. These factors represent a significant departure from the previous stalemate. The primary counterargument, and why my probability is not higher, is Lebanon's well-documented history of political paralysis and the failure to implement reforms even after reaching a preliminary agreement in 2022. Powerful vested interests have repeatedly blocked progress. Furthermore, with only one month remaining, the timeline is extremely tight for closing a complex deal that requires broad political consensus. However, I am weighting the current, active negotiations more heavily than historical failures. The sheer depth of the economic crisis may finally be sufficient to force the necessary compromises to at least announce an agreement. I would increase my forecast if the Lebanese parliament passes key legislation (e.g., a capital controls law) before the deadline. I would decrease it if the June 10 talks are reported as stalled or if a major political bloc publicly denounces the proposed terms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
