    "review": "The deliberation revealed a critical information gap between the forecasters. My initial analysis and Forecaster 3's were based on incomplete or outdated information. My research report provided a high-level summary of Berkshire's Q1 activity but crucially omitted any mention of Domino's. Forecaster 3 was operating under the assumption that Berkshire had no existing stake, which appears to be incorrect. Forecaster 2 provided two decisive pieces of evidence that I had not considered: 1) Berkshire had already established and added to a Domino's position in Q3 and Q4 of 2024, creating a clear pattern of accumulation. 2) Specific news reports from early May 2025 claim Berkshire's stake has reached 7%. This new information is highly compelling and directly addresses the question, rendering my initial analysis obsolete. Forecaster 2's reasoning is extremely convincing, as it is based on superior, specific, and timely evidence.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically updating my forecast from 15% to 92%. My initial forecast was based on a research report indicating Berkshire was a net seller and which listed specific Q1 purchases that did not include Domino's Pizza. The absence of evidence led me to a low probability. However, Forecaster 2's analysis introduced new, dispositive information that I find credible. The fact that Berkshire was already building a position in the preceding two quarters makes a further purchase in Q1 2025 a logical continuation of their strategy. More importantly, the news reports in early May of a 7% stake, which would be approximately 2.5 million shares, directly implies the threshold of 2,382,000 shares has been crossed. The timing of these reports, just ahead of the 13F filing deadline, strongly suggests the information pertains to the Q1 period. My confidence is not 100% because there remains a small chance the news reports are inaccurate, or that the purchase pushing the stake to 7% occurred in April (i.e., in Q2 2025) and will not be on this specific filing. Nevertheless, this new evidence is strong enough to warrant a complete reversal of my initial position.",
