  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–16 days (NBS May CPI typically releases around June 12; FRED usually updates a couple of days after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another very small negative y/y print (around -0.1%), extending deflation to a fourth month",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Holiday-driven services firmness (travel, accommodation, airfares) plus slightly less negative energy and stabilization in pork push headline CPI to 0.0% or +0.1% y/y; FRED rounds to 0.0 or +0.1, yielding No",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food and domestic energy stay negative y/y and demand remains soft; May m/m is flat-to-negative (seasonally common with cheaper vegetables), leaving headline at about -0.1% y/y and FRED rounds negative",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions point to another marginally negative headline. We already have three consecutive negative y/y prints (Feb -0.7%, Mar -0.1%, Apr -0.1). PPI deflation deepened to -2.7% y/y in April, PMIs show manufacturing contraction in May (49.5), property remains weak, and pork prices are still below last year — all consistent with subdued consumer price pressure. The research assistant also notes domestic energy prices remain negative y/y despite Brent being ~4% higher y/y, so energy likely still drags. Core CPI is modestly positive (~+0.5% y/y), signaling underlying inflation isn’t collapsing, but it has not been strong enough to offset food/energy drags in recent months. Seasonal factors are mixed: May often sees services strength around the Labor Day holiday, but food (notably vegetables) can be softer m/m. Given April was -0.1% and the structure of drivers hasn’t materially changed, the status quo favors another small negative print. Why not higher: holiday-related services firmness, a slightly less negative energy contribution, and the fact core is positive could lift headline to 0.0%/+0.1%. Rounding on FRED is a real risk near zero (e.g., -0.04% could display 0.0%). Why not lower: policy easing (RRR cut) and higher global oil versus a year ago provide some offset; sustained core positivity suggests outright deeper deflation is unlikely. What would move me upward (toward Yes): continued weakness in high-frequency food prices (pork/veg) through late May, reports of negative month-on-month headline, or analyst consensus tilting to negative. What would move me downward (toward No): indications of strong services inflation from holiday travel, a clear rebound in pork, or previews/consensus pointing to 0.0% or +0.1% with emphasis on rounding risk.",
