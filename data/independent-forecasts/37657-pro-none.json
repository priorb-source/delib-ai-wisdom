    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, there are no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any public confirmation of a human case of HKU5-CoV-2 by a credible source like the WHO or CDC. This would occur if the virus does not spill over to humans, or if a single isolated case occurs but is not detected or reported.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover event occurs, infecting at least one human. The case is detected by healthcare systems, the virus is sequenced and identified as HKU5-CoV-2, and the case is officially reported by an organization like the WHO or CDC before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the status quo and the low base rate of zoonotic spillover events. The vast majority of animal viruses do not infect humans. For a 'Yes' outcome, a chain of low-probability events must occur within a very short timeframe of less than two months: a human must be infected, the infection must be detected, the virus must be correctly identified through sequencing, and the case must be officially reported by a credible international body. Each step in this process adds a significant hurdle, making the overall probability very low. The information from the research assistant was null, so my forecast relies on general principles of virology and epidemiology. \n\nMy probability is not lower, such as 0.1%, because global surveillance for novel respiratory viruses has intensified significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. This heightened awareness and improved infrastructure slightly increase the likelihood that a rare spillover event would be detected and reported compared to the pre-2020 era. \n\nMy probability is not higher, such as 5% or 10%, because the timeframe is extremely short. Even with enhanced surveillance, the initial spillover event itself remains fundamentally rare. The bureaucratic and scientific process of confirming and reporting a novel virus case also takes time, making the tight deadline a major constraint. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of unexplained pneumonia clusters in regions where the animal host of HKU5-CoV-2 is prevalent. I would decrease my forecast as the deadline approaches with no such reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
