    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable new information and perspectives that clarified the situation. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial piece of data: a previous proposal received only 16 votes. This quantifies the opposition much more precisely than my initial understanding of a 'tabled' vote, showing proponents are 8 votes short of the 24-vote supermajority. This is a very high hurdle. Forecaster 3's heavy emphasis on the short timeframe and the NFL's typical rule-change cycle (centered around the March Annual Meeting) was also highly convincing. They rightly pointed out that achieving such a significant swing in votes outside the primary window and on such a short deadline is procedurally difficult. Forecaster 3's point about pressure from the Commissioner is plausible, but their mention of 'health officials citing player safety concerns' contradicts my source material, which stated there is no data to support this. I therefore discount that specific piece of their reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I am decreasing my forecast from 35% to 25%. This 10-point reduction is driven primarily by the specific vote count provided by Forecaster 2. Knowing that proponents started with only 16 votes, and need to gain 8 more, makes the path to a 'Yes' outcome significantly more difficult than I had initially assessed. Flipping 8 of the 16 opposing/undecided owners in under three weeks without a compelling new safety argument is a very steep climb. Forecaster 3's focus on the tight deadline reinforces this difficulty. The status quo has immense inertia, and the procedural bar is high. While my original reasoning remains sound—the lack of a safety mandate and the lobbying efforts of teams like the Eagles are major obstacles for the ban's proponents—the new data on the voting gap provides a much clearer picture of the challenge. I am not lowering my forecast to 15% because having half the league (16 owners) already in favor of a ban represents significant momentum. The fact that proponents are quickly reworking the proposal suggests a concerted effort is underway, which gives them a non-trivial chance of success. However, the quantified difficulty of the task warrants a significant downward adjustment.",
