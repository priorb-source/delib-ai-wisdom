  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.\n\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4-6 months assuming a fall 2025 Canadian federal election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservative Party in Quebec",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a significant surge beyond their Quebec City regional base, expanding their appeal across Quebec while the Bloc's support continues to erode due to the Liberal surge under Carney. Conservatives could capitalize on vote efficiency in newly competitive ridings or benefit from strategic voting patterns that consolidate the federalist vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc Québécois maintains its current polling advantage of 5-17 percentage points over the Conservatives in Quebec. Even with Liberal gains cutting into Bloc support, the Bloc's province-wide presence and organizational strength allow them to win 19-25 seats compared to the Conservatives' 10-12 seats, similar to the 2019 and 2021 election patterns where the Bloc won 32 seats versus the Conservatives' 10.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Historical precedent is clear: the Bloc has consistently outperformed the Conservatives in Quebec, winning 32 vs 10 seats in both 2019 and 2021. Current seat projection models (Canada388, The Writ) estimate the Bloc will win 19-25 seats versus 10-12 for the Conservatives. While the Bloc has experienced a significant decline from 37% to 23-27% in polling, they remain at or slightly above Conservative support levels (23%), and crucially still lead by 5-17 percentage points in aggregated polls. The Conservative Party's support is highly concentrated in the Quebec City region and south shore, which limits their ability to win seats across the province. The Liberal surge under Carney appears to be drawing primarily from Bloc voters rather than Conservative voters, but this hasn't changed the relative ordering between Bloc and Conservatives. My forecast is not higher (closer to 90%+) because several months remain until the election, creating opportunity for further shifts in voter sentiment. The Bloc's decline shows they are vulnerable, and continued erosion could theoretically bring them below Conservative seat counts. Additionally, seat projection models contain inherent uncertainty in converting poll percentages to actual seats. My forecast is not lower because the structural advantages for the Bloc are substantial: they have a province-wide organization, current polling leads, favorable seat projections across multiple models, and strong historical performance. For me to update toward No, I would need to see: (1) Bloc polling falling to 20% or below while Conservatives rise above 25%, (2) seat projections converging to show Conservatives competitive or ahead, or (3) evidence of Conservative breakthrough beyond Quebec City. For me to update toward higher Yes probability, I would need to see: (1) Bloc polling stabilizing or recovering, (2) seat projection ranges widening further in Bloc's favor, or (3) evidence that Liberal gains have plateaued.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
