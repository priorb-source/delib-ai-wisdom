    "yes_outcome_scenario": "After his exploratory committee receives positive feedback regarding fundraising and voter support, Dan Osborn formally announces his candidacy for the US Senate in a press statement or public event before June 1, 2025, to begin his campaign against the incumbent.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 65%. The primary piece of evidence is the early April news that Dan Osborn is formally exploring a run. Publicly forming an exploratory committee is a significant, concrete step that signals serious intent and often serves as a precursor to a formal campaign launch. The timeframe is key; the June 1, 2025 deadline is less than two months after this news broke. For a challenger campaign, it is strategically advantageous to capitalize on initial media buzz and begin the long process of fundraising and building name recognition early. Therefore, an announcement within this window is a logical next step if the exploration is positive. The status quo is that he has not yet announced, and any campaign launch requires overcoming this inertia. However, the signal of a public exploration is strong enough to suggest a change from the status quo is more likely than not. My confidence is not higher because an exploratory phase can genuinely lead to a 'no-go' decision. The challenges of running against a well-funded incumbent like Pete Ricketts in Nebraska are substantial, and Osborn may conclude the path to victory is too narrow. My forecast is not lower because the public nature of this step suggests a high level of commitment, and delaying a decision for too long would risk losing the initial momentum generated by the news. I would increase my forecast upon news of significant fundraising commitments or key endorsements. I would decrease it if reports emerged of a stalled exploration or if the May 31 deadline approaches with no further activity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
