  "information": "Official data from Eurostat showed the euro area annual inflation rate was 2.2% in March 2025, down from 2.3% in February. The primary contributors to the March inflation rate were services (+1.56 percentage points), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (+0.57 pp), and non-energy industrial goods (+0.16 pp). Energy prices had a negative contribution (-0.10 pp). According to news reports citing polls from Bloomberg and Reuters, the consensus among economists for the April 2025 inflation figure is 2.1%. A quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters by the ECB indicated that inflation for 2025 is expected to be 2.2%, with a forecast of 2.0% for 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-7 days. Eurostat typically releases the preliminary inflation data for the previous month in the first few days of the following month, so the April 2025 data should be published in early May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The inflation rate will be at or below 2.2%, not above it.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation continues its downward trajectory from 2.3% in February to 2.2% in March, coming in at the consensus forecast of 2.1% or remaining flat at 2.2% for April. This would be consistent with the ECB's broader disinflationary trend and the negative contribution from energy prices continuing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inflation unexpectedly increases or proves stickier than forecast, coming in above 2.2%. This could occur if services inflation accelerates further, energy prices reverse course and contribute positively, or if there are unexpected supply shocks or seasonal effects that weren't fully captured in the consensus forecast.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests a No outcome. March 2025 inflation was exactly 2.2%, showing a downward trend from February's 2.3%. The economist consensus from Bloomberg and Reuters polls is 2.1%, which is below the 2.2% threshold. Additionally, the question requires inflation to be ABOVE 2.2%, meaning even if it matches March's figure, that would resolve as No. The March breakdown showed energy prices contributing negatively (-0.10pp), which if sustained, would support continued disinflation. However, services inflation remains sticky at +1.56pp, which is the main upside risk. Consensus forecasts carry uncertainty - they represent the median expectation but actual outcomes can deviate. The standard error on inflation forecasts is typically 0.2-0.4 percentage points, meaning there's a meaningful tail risk that April could come in higher than expected. What would make me update higher: Evidence of unexpected price pressures in April data releases before the official figure, upward revisions to March data, or news of supply shocks. What would make me update lower: Additional confirmation that disinflation is accelerating, or preliminary indicators showing softer price pressures. Given the strong downward trend, consensus below threshold, and the requirement for inflation to be strictly above 2.2%, I assign a low probability to the Yes outcome, but acknowledge meaningful forecast uncertainty.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
