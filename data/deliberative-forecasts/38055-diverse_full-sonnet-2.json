    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 52-57%, suggesting convergence on the fundamental assessment. Forecaster 2's reasoning closely parallels mine, emphasizing Pyfer's momentum versus Gastelum's experience. Forecaster 3 provides the most granular breakdown and raises an important concern I underweighted: Pyfer's cardio/pace issues in step-up competition (specifically mentioning the Hermansson fight). This is valuable information - if Pyfer's UFC loss showed cardio problems, that's concerning against a durable, experienced veteran like Gastelum who can push pace over three rounds. Forecaster 3's explicit modeling of the replacement fighter scenario (5% at 65% win rate) is methodologically sound, though it only shifts the overall probability by ~1-2 points. The base rate citation of 5-15% for UFC main card cancellations within two weeks is helpful calibration data. Where I differ from Forecaster 3: I'm slightly less concerned about late cancellation risk given that we're past the two-week mark and Pyfer has had two months to recover from his illness. However, the cardio concern is legitimate and should lower my win-if-fighting estimate from ~60% to ~58%.",
    "rationale": "Reconsidering my analysis with the new information: P(fight occurs) remains around 90-92% given proximity to event date and no recent concerning reports. P(Pyfer wins | fights Gastelum) should be adjusted down from 60% to approximately 58% to account for: (1) Forecaster 3's valid point about Pyfer's cardio/pace concerns in step-up fights; (2) Gastelum's proven durability across 23 prior UFC fights; (3) The three-round format potentially favoring the more experienced fighter if it goes the distance. Incorporating a small probability (~5%) of a replacement opponent at higher win probability (~65%) yields: 0.87 × 0.58 + 0.05 × 0.65 ≈ 53.7%. Rounding to 54% represents a modest downward revision from my initial 56%, positioning me between Forecaster 3's more conservative 52% and Forecaster 2's 57%. This reflects appropriate weighting of the cardio concern while maintaining that Pyfer's recent form, physical advantages, and knockout power still make him a modest favorite.",
