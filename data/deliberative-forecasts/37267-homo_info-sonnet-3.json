    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I hadn't considered. Forecaster 2's point about the April 30 review (just 2 days ago) confirming Ethiopia is NOT among Level 4 countries is highly significant - agencies rarely reverse major decisions within weeks. Even more important: Ethiopia was actually downgraded FROM Level 4 TO Level 3 in early 2023, showing a positive trajectory, not negative. This directly contradicts my assumption of deteriorating conditions. Forecaster 3's base rate analysis is compelling: only 2-4 countries upgrade from Level 3 to Level 4 annually (6-16% per year), which translates to just 1-3% over our 2-month window. Both correctly note that while regional concerns exist, the State Department has designated specific areas rather than the entire country for Level 4 warnings, suggesting they view risks as localized. My emphasis on the May 1 sanctions now seems less predictive given the research assistant explicitly notes NO major incidents have occurred since then. However, I shouldn't update as low as 6% because: (1) sanctions do signal serious US concern, (2) rapid deterioration is possible in conflict zones, and (3) the question background mentions 'new travel warnings in 2025' suggesting some deterioration. The April 30 review timing is the most decisive factor - it would require extraordinary circumstances to reverse course within 60 days of a formal review.",
    "rationale": "My original 13% forecast overweighted recent sanctions and regional instability while missing crucial context. The April 30 review confirming Level 3 status just 2 days before resolution date is highly informative. Ethiopia's trajectory from Level 4 down to Level 3 in 2023 indicates improvement, not deterioration. The base rate of 1-3% over 2 months provides a strong anchor. While the May 1 sanctions and regional violence are concerning, the absence of major incidents involving foreigners, coups, or nationwide offensives makes a dramatic upgrade unlikely in such a short timeframe. The State Department's practice of issuing localized rather than nationwide Level 4 warnings for Ethiopia suggests they view the situation as manageable. I'm updating significantly downward but not to the lowest forecast because: (1) conflict zones can deteriorate rapidly, (2) sanctions indicate genuine concern, and (3) 2 months provides some possibility for catastrophic events. My updated forecast of 8% reflects base rates adjusted modestly upward for context while acknowledging the very recent positive review and improving historical trajectory.",
