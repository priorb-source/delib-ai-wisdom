    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025; know by July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi continues not to list real-money MLB game markets in June; or they experiment briefly but miss at least one calendar day; or a regulatory block/hold prevents sports game listings; or an operational lapse or site outage causes a gap on one day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi secures the needed regulatory pathway for sports game event contracts and launches MLB game markets immediately in early June, then successfully lists at least one market tied to a same-day MLB game every single day through June 30 without any gaps.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and regulation: Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated DCM. Historically, the CFTC has been reluctant to allow event contracts deemed gaming, including sports game outcomes. Kalshi’s prominent legal fight concerns election markets, not sports, and even a favorable, fast ruling there would not automatically greenlight sports game contracts. As of May 31, 2025, there’s no public evidence that Kalshi has regulatory approval to list MLB game markets or that such markets are live. The provided article about the court moving quickly pertains to political markets, not sports.\n- Timing and operational stringency: The bar for a Yes is high—every day in June must have at least one MLB game market. Even if Kalshi were to launch, a single missed day (regulatory hiccup, operational issue, or strategic pause) would resolve the question No. The short runway (immediate launch required) further reduces the likelihood.\n- Market precedent: Prior CFTC stances (e.g., denials to list political and sports-like event contracts on other venues) make a near-term shift to allow MLB game markets on a federally regulated exchange improbable on this timeline.\n- Why not higher: No clear signal of imminent sports markets, regulatory uncertainty, and the all-days requirement compound risk.\n- Why not lower: Nonzero chance that Kalshi has a novel compliance framework or obtains a quick path and deliberately pilots daily MLB markets; also a small chance that a legal/regulatory development in June accelerates broader event-contract permissibility.\n- What would move me up: Official Kalshi announcement of sports game markets; visible MLB game contracts listed for June 1 with a published schedule suggesting daily coverage; credible reporting of CFTC non-objection or a legal ruling that clearly enables such products.\n- What would move me down: Continued absence of any MLB game listings through the first week of June; explicit statements from Kalshi or the CFTC indicating sports game markets are not permitted.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kalshi offer markets on daily baseball games every day in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLas Vegas Review-Journal: [Judge says he’ll move quickly on Kalshi prediction market case](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/judge-says-hell-move-quickly-on-kalshi-prediction-market-case-3374672/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, every day in June 2025, [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/?category=sports&tag=baseball) offers a real-money prediction market on at least one Major League Baseball game being played that day.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
