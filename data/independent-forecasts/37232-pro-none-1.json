    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by the contents of Virgin Galactic's News page between May 1, 2025, and May 31, 2025. The final result will be known on June 1, 2025, approximately one month from today's date of April 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is a period of silence on the company's news page. The last post was on January 30, 2025, nearly three months ago. If this trend continues, no new post will be made in May, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic, as a publicly traded company, releases its Q1 2025 earnings report in early May. As is standard practice, a press release summarizing the financial results and providing a business update is published on its website's News page, triggering a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company continues its 'heads-down' focus on developing the Delta-class spacecraft and has no significant operational milestones to report. The Q1 earnings report is either released in the last days of April or delayed until June, meaning the month of May passes with no new posts.",
    "rationale": "The primary evidence supporting a 'Yes' forecast is the status quo. As of April 29, 2025, Virgin Galactic has not updated its news page for nearly three months, a significant quiet period. If this were the only factor, the probability of another silent month would be high. However, a much stronger force is at play: the company's obligations as a publicly traded entity. Public companies follow a predictable quarterly earnings reporting cycle. Virgin Galactic's first quarter (Q1) ended on March 31, 2025. Historically, the company has reported Q1 earnings in early May (e.g., May 7 in 2024). It is standard, almost universal, practice to issue a press release that is posted to the company's website concurrent with an earnings report. This cyclical and highly predictable event is a powerful forcing function that is very likely to break the current silence. Therefore, the recent lull in news is better interpreted as a lack of interim operational updates, rather than a new policy of non-communication. The forecast is not lower than 7% because there is a small but non-zero chance that the earnings release is scheduled just outside the May window (i.e., very late April or early June), or that a change in communication strategy means the earnings release is not posted on this specific news page. The forecast is not higher because the institutional pressure and established cadence for public companies to post their quarterly earnings release is extremely strong, making a post in May a very high probability event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
