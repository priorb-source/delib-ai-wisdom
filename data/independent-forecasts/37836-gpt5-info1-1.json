  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Leaning No or borderline (the current EBL page on flightsfrom.com is likely around the high-20s to ~31 destinations)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, only a couple of new summer routes materialize while a few existing routes are paused or slip start dates. FlightsFrom either doesn’t list some marginal/charter/irregular Iranian or Saudi services, or a brief regional disruption leads to temporary suspensions visible on July 1. The visible count sits at 28–31.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple summer additions are visible on July 1: Aegean’s ATH–EBL is active, Eurowings’ CGN–EBL is listed, Turkish leisure seasonals (e.g., Antalya) and added Gulf/Iranian/Umrah routes are all scheduled, and domestic Iraqi links persist. The flightsfrom.com EBL page shows 32+ distinct airports.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: I can’t check the page today, but Erbil typically has a broad network across Turkey, the Gulf, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, domestic Iraqi cities, and several European points serving the diaspora. The research assistant notes new 2025 links (Aegean to Athens already launched; Eurowings adding Cologne/Bonn for summer) and cites that Iraqi Kurdistan as a whole now connects to 21 countries—implying a wide base that likely concentrates at Erbil. July is peak season in this region, when seasonal Turkish leisure routes and pilgrimage/visit-friends-and-relatives demand usually push network breadth up. Those factors push me toward Yes.\n\nWhy not higher: 1) Status quo anchoring—without today’s exact flightsfrom count, the safest base case is that EBL sits near the threshold (high-20s to low-30s). 2) The 21-country stat may include Sulaymaniyah, so not all accrue to EBL. 3) Some announced routes may slip, be low-frequency, or not be reflected by flightsfrom if scheduling data isn’t in their feeds. 4) Security/airspace disruptions around specific dates can temporarily reduce the visible list. 5) The assistant’s mention of easyJet ATH–EBL is uncertain; if that doesn’t happen, the uplift is smaller.\n\nWhy not lower: Concrete 2025 additions (Aegean ATH active; Eurowings CGN planned) and typical summer seasonal expansions, plus likely multiple Turkish/UAE/Iranian/Saudi/domestic Iraqi points, make 32+ plausible. Even if a few routes slip, breadth across many countries provides redundancy.\n\nWhat would change my view: Up if (a) flightsfrom.com already lists ≥32 today, (b) confirmations that Eurowings CGN and additional summer routes are loaded and visible on flightsfrom for July. Down if (a) the current count is ≤28, (b) key routes are delayed/cancelled into July, (c) a mid‑late June disruption leads to wider suspensions visible on July 1, or (d) flightsfrom excludes several Iranian or seasonal routes I’m implicitly counting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDirect air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
