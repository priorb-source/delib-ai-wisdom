    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, agree on the core premise: the policy excluding Tesla rebates is very new (March 2025) and backed by a clear government rationale ('preference Canadian goods'). Given the short timeframe until the July 2025 resolution date, a genuine policy reversal is extremely unlikely due to governmental and bureaucratic inertia. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my initial thoughts, focusing on this high inertia and assigning an 88% probability. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial and convincing argument that I had completely overlooked: the resolution's brittleness. The outcome hinges on the precise wording of a specific webpage. Forecaster 3 correctly points out that a 'No' resolution could occur not from a policy reversal, but from a simple website content update—for example, if BC Hydro decides to remove the explicit mention of 'Tesla' and replace it with generic country-of-origin eligibility criteria. This insight fundamentally changes the risk profile of the question from being solely about high-level policy to also including lower-level communications and web administration decisions.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward significantly based on the deliberation. My initial 95% forecast was based almost entirely on the low probability of a policy reversal. Forecaster 3's analysis convincingly demonstrates a second, independent path to a 'No' outcome: a change in the website's wording, even if the underlying policy remains unchanged. Large organizations like BC Hydro frequently update their web content for clarity, style, or administrative reasons. While there is a strong counter-argument that explicitly naming a popular, now-ineligible brand like Tesla is good customer service and reduces confusion, the risk that the communications team might opt for more generic language is real and must be factored in. This 'wording risk' was a blind spot in my initial analysis. I now estimate the probability of the *policy* remaining unchanged through July 2025 is still very high (~95%), but the probability of the *specific wording* on that page remaining unchanged (given the policy is unchanged) is lower. I estimate this at roughly 90%, due to the strong incentive for clarity. Combining these probabilities (0.95 * 0.90) leads to an updated forecast of approximately 86%. This revision reflects the new source of uncertainty identified by Forecaster 3, and brings my forecast closer to those of my peers.",
