    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key evidence and the primary dynamics of this question. We all identified the same core tension: the raw political power of the Republican supermajorities versus the demonstrated lack of political will, best evidenced by the party's recent and active removal of a similar provision from the transportation budget. We all also noted the short timeline and Governor DeWine's hesitation as factors favoring a 'No' outcome. The differences in our forecasts (15%, 25%, 30%) stem purely from the weight assigned to these factors. Forecaster 2 gives more weight to the supermajority's latent power, while Forecaster 3 gives more weight to the demonstrated inertia and political hurdles. I found Forecaster 3's articulation of how Governor DeWine's hesitation complicates the political calculus for legislative leadership—potentially forcing an undesirable intra-party fight—to be particularly insightful and a point I had not fully weighted.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 25%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly to 20%. The deliberation process reinforced my belief that the most important piece of evidence is the Republican-led removal of a proof-of-citizenship requirement from the transportation budget in February 2025. This is a powerful, concrete signal of inaction that outweighs the more general arguments about the supermajority's power. I was particularly persuaded by Forecaster 3's point that Governor DeWine's hesitation is not just a potential hurdle after enactment, but a current political deterrent that makes legislative leaders less likely to prioritize a controversial bill that could lead to an internal party conflict. This adds weight to the 'No' camp. I am not lowering my forecast to 15% because I believe the raw power of the supermajority to act quickly if a triggering event occurs still warrants a significant, albeit minority, probability. I am moving away from 30% because the evidence for legislative inertia on this specific issue is now too compelling to ignore. Therefore, a modest downward adjustment from 25% to 20% best reflects my updated weighing of the evidence.",
