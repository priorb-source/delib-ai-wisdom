    "review": "The other forecasters presented compelling new evidence and arguments that I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive, providing a strong quantitative anchor by highlighting that the sentiment index would need to jump by at least 7.9 points from a baseline of 52.2, an event that has historically occurred less than 3% of the time in a single month. This statistical context makes a 'Yes' outcome appear far more improbable than my initial assessment suggested. Forecaster 3 added crucial, recent economic data, specifically the weak ADP jobs report and rising student loan delinquencies, which provides a fundamental rationale for why consumer sentiment is likely to remain suppressed. Their explanation of the divergence between the University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys was also valuable in dismissing what appeared to be a conflicting positive signal. Both analyses convincingly argue for a lower probability.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards based on the deliberation. My initial 40% probability was based on the general negative trend but did not fully appreciate the statistical improbability of the required rebound. Forecaster 2’s quantitative analysis, showing that an 8-point monthly gain is a rare event, is a powerful piece of evidence that I now weigh heavily. This historical data suggests that simply reversing the recent 'plunge' is a much higher bar to clear than I had assumed. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's introduction of fresh negative data points—a weakening labor market signal from ADP and tangible consumer financial stress from loan delinquencies—provides a strong fundamental justification for pessimism to persist through June. In light of this new statistical and economic evidence, I believe the likelihood of the index surpassing 60.0 is substantially lower than I first estimated. I am revising my forecast from 40% down to 15%. The remaining probability accounts for the inherent volatility of sentiment surveys and the non-zero chance of a major positive economic surprise, such as a sharp drop in inflation or a blowout official jobs report, before the final number is released.",
