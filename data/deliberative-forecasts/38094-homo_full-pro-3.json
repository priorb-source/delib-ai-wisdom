    "review": "All three forecasters identify the same core tension: the powerful inertia of the status quo versus a uniquely severe set of destabilizing factors. We are in strong agreement on the key variables: Senator Fetterman's isolation, high staff turnover, documented health concerns, GOP outreach efforts, his public statements, and the very short timeline. The forecasts are tightly clustered between 15% and 20%, reflecting a shared understanding of the situation. Forecaster 2's analysis reinforces my initial assessment perfectly. Forecaster 3's analysis, while similar, places a slightly higher weight on the potential for a sudden, non-political event, such as a resignation prompted by a health crisis, being the 'most plausible catalyst.' I find this specific point convincing, as such an event is less constrained by the typical political calculus and short timeline that would govern a party switch.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing my forecast from 15% to 20%. My initial forecast was heavily weighted by the high barriers to a senator switching parties or resigning, especially on such a short timeline. However, Forecaster 3's emphasis on a health-related issue being a plausible catalyst for a *sudden* resignation convinced me to slightly increase the weight I assign to that specific scenario. A politically negotiated party switch is unlikely to conclude in the next month, but a resignation prompted by a health crisis or family intervention could happen abruptly and with little warning. The evidence supporting this risk—particularly the detailed email from his former chief of staff—is unusually strong and specific. While I still believe the status quo is the most probable outcome, the severity of the reported issues makes the situation highly volatile. The deliberation has solidified my view that the risk of a break, while still an outside chance, is closer to 1-in-5 than the 1-in-7 I initially assessed.",
