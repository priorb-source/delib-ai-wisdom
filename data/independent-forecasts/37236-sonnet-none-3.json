    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 6 weeks after month-end, so April 2025 data should be published around early to mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests a slight increase. The threshold of $262,578 million represents April 2024 exports. Historically, US exports tend to grow nominally year-over-year by 2-3% due to inflation and economic growth, which would translate to approximately $5-8 billion above the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs, implemented earlier in 2025, trigger significant retaliatory measures from major trading partners (China, EU, Canada, Mexico). These counter-tariffs suppress demand for US goods and services abroad. Combined with trade policy uncertainty causing businesses to pause export activities and potential supply chain disruptions, US exports decline or remain flat compared to April 2024, failing to exceed the $262,578 million threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff headwinds, inflationary pressure on nominal values (2-3% annually) pushes export values higher. Exporters accelerate shipments to get ahead of anticipated retaliatory tariffs. Strong sectors like agricultural exports, energy, and services maintain or increase their international sales. The dollar weakens slightly, making US goods more competitive. Even modest growth of $1 million above April 2024 levels would result in a Yes outcome.",
    "rationale": "The threshold requires only minimal growth—any increase above $262,578 million resolves as Yes. Under normal conditions, inflation alone (2-3% annually) would add $5-8 billion to nominal export values, easily clearing this bar. However, the mention of Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs introduces significant uncertainty. Trade wars historically create headwinds for exports through retaliation and uncertainty, as seen during 2018-2019. Yet there's typically a lag between tariff implementation and full economic impact—if tariffs were announced in early 2025, April might still show relatively normal patterns. The very low threshold (essentially requiring only flat-to-slightly-up performance) tilts probability toward Yes. Working against a higher forecast: meaningful trade retaliation could suppress exports enough to offset inflation. Working against a lower forecast: it would require unusual circumstances for nominal exports to actually decline year-over-year, as inflation provides a strong baseline lift. No additional information from the research assistant limits ability to assess current export trends. Key updates that would shift my forecast: early 2025 export data showing actual trends, specific details on retaliatory measures, or dollar strength movements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
