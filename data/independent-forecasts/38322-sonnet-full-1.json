  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The final June 2025 report is expected to be posted on Friday, June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which is already below the 54.0 threshold. If sentiment remains near current levels, the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment improves by at least 1.8 points from May's 52.2 to reach 54.0 or higher. This could occur if tariff negotiations show significant progress, inflation expectations decline meaningfully, the Federal Reserve signals imminent rate cuts, or strong positive economic data emerges that overshadows current concerns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stays at or below current levels (52.2) or declines further below 54.0. This would occur if tariff concerns persist or intensify, inflation expectations remain elevated, economic data continues showing weakness, or no meaningful positive policy developments materialize to offset the structural headwinds affecting consumer psychology.",
    "rationale": "The May 2025 final reading of 52.2 is already below the 54.0 threshold, establishing a status quo that favors a Yes outcome. The index has experienced a severe decline of nearly 30% since January 2025, dropping from 64.7 in February to 57.0 in March to 52.2 in May. This strong downward trend reflects persistent structural concerns: three-quarters of consumers cite tariffs as a source of uncertainty, inflation expectations remain elevated (7.3% one-year ahead, 4.6% long-term), and consumer behavior shows marked caution with low spending growth and high savings rates. However, there are countervailing signals. May showed improvement from its preliminary reading of 50.8 to the final 52.2 (a 1.4 point gain), and the Conference Board consumer confidence index jumped from 85.7 to 98. For June to reach 54.0 or higher, sentiment would need to improve by only 1.8 points - a modest increase that's within the range of normal monthly variation. My forecast is not higher (80%+) because consumer sentiment is volatile and can shift quickly on policy news, particularly regarding trade negotiations. The Conference Board's improvement suggests some positive momentum exists. Additionally, we're early in June with three weeks remaining before the final survey period concludes. My forecast is not lower (50-60%) because the structural headwinds remain firmly in place - tariff uncertainty shows no signs of resolution, inflation expectations are elevated, and the ISM indicators suggest economic softness. The current reading of 52.2 provides limited buffer below the threshold. I would revise my forecast higher if credible news emerges of substantial progress in trade negotiations, inflation expectations decline sharply, or the Fed signals imminent rate cuts. I would revise lower if tariffs escalate, economic data deteriorates further, or preliminary June readings show continued decline.",
