    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes summer seasonality and points to multiple resumptions, but their argument leans on frequency increases (which don’t raise destination count) and at least one dubious example (SAS to BEY is unlikely). Without a verified baseline, their 58% seems optimistic for crossing 51 unique destinations. Forecaster 3 contributes a concrete baseline claim (53 in May 2024 to 39 in May 2025). If accurate, that’s highly material: adding 12–13 destinations within six weeks is a big lift, especially given the security context and recent Iranian flight restrictions. I find F3’s direction and logic more convincing than F2’s, though 10% looks a bit too low if some seasonal leisure routes materialize and MEA/Gulf carriers sustain broad regional coverage.",
    "rationale": "My prior leaned slightly below the threshold on the assumption BEY would sit near the high 40s/around 50 by early July. The new (plausible) data point that BEY is around 39 destinations in May 2025 materially lowers the likelihood of exceeding 51 by July 1. Even if 6–7 resumptions/adds occur into peak season, that likely only gets BEY to the mid‑40s. Security-driven caution, the ban on certain Iranian flights (removing 1–3 destinations), and the short runway to July further constrain upside. I don’t go as low as 10% because: (a) summer seasonal routes to nearby leisure markets could still appear, (b) diaspora demand supports regional connectivity, and (c) a sudden stabilization could unlock a handful of resumptions. But the path to >51 now looks meaningfully unlikely absent a clear de-escalation and multiple European/Gulf resumptions already loaded into schedules by mid-June. Net: I update down from 40% to 25%.",
