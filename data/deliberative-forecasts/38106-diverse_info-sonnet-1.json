    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 introduces crucial new information about Trump calling Putin 'absolutely crazy' and expressing severe disappointment, which significantly undermines the likelihood of a friendly visit. Forecaster 3 provides valuable historical context (the May 9 trip that didn't happen), mentions the February mutual invitations but correctly notes these don't require meeting in Russia, and raises SPIEF as a potential hook - though with no signals of U.S. participation. Both forecasters emphasize the absence of preparatory signals more strongly than I did: no advance teams, no NOTAMs, no flight movements, no scheduling placeholders. These logistical indicators are typically visible weeks before a presidential trip. The independent convergence on 3% by both forecasters, combined with the hostile rhetoric evidence, suggests I may have been too generous at 6%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing their arguments, I'm updating downward for several reasons: (1) The hostile rhetoric between Trump and Putin creates an even more adverse diplomatic environment than I initially assessed - friendly visits don't follow one leader calling the other 'absolutely crazy'; (2) The complete absence of logistical preparatory signals (advance teams, security coordination, published indicators) with only 32 days remaining is more dispositive than I originally weighted; (3) Two independent forecasters converged on 3%, suggesting analytical consensus around that level; (4) While SPIEF in early June could theoretically provide a hook, there are zero signals of Trump planning to attend. However, I'm not going all the way to 3% because: (a) Trump's unpredictability and history of unconventional diplomacy remains; (b) The February mutual invitations, while not requiring Russia as a venue, do establish some precedent for engagement; (c) A surprise breakthrough initiative, while extremely unlikely, isn't impossible in the 32-day window. I'm settling on 4% as acknowledgment that the other forecasters' arguments are compelling while maintaining slight independence against groupthink.",
