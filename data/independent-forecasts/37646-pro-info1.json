  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (46 days), until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 15, 2025, the Starlink availability map lists Somalia as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon', not 'Available'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license being granted, logistical, technical, or unexpected security-related delays in deploying ground infrastructure and updating systems push the operational start date past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The company's internal timeline for 'soon' proves to be longer than the six weeks remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the mid-April 2025 license approval and public announcements, Starlink's final preparations proceed as planned. The company activates the service for Somalia and updates its official availability map to show the country as 'Available' in the coming weeks, well before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the fact that the primary obstacle, obtaining a full operating license from Somalia's National Communications Authority, was cleared in mid-April 2025 after a multi-year process. This was followed by high-level public announcements from both Elon Musk and the Somali government, creating strong momentum for a rapid launch. The statement from Starlink representatives that the service would be available 'nationwide soon' suggests the final steps are underway. The remaining timeframe of approximately six weeks is typically sufficient for the logistical rollout and system updates required to go live after regulatory approval has been secured. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the term 'soon' is ambiguous and unforeseen logistical or security challenges could still cause delays. The status quo is that the service is not yet available, and some execution risk remains in turning the approval into an active service. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of a full license and public commitments from the CEO and host government are extremely strong positive indicators. It is rare for a company to reach this stage and then delay activation for months without a major, unexpected issue. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of Starlink terminals being shipped to or activated in Somalia. I would decrease my forecast if the deadline approaches without any change to the map, or if reports of specific technical or regulatory setbacks emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSomalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
