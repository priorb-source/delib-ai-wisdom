    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful, particularly Forecaster 3's. Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns closely with my initial assessment, emphasizing the sticky status quo, the high costs of announcing a referendum, and Dodik's history of using threats as leverage. Their 15% forecast represents a slightly higher weighting of tail risks than my initial 10%, which is a reasonable position. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was the most impactful on my thinking. They presented specific, crucial evidence I had not sufficiently weighted: the recent concrete institutional preparations, such as the public consultation on a constitutional draft including self-determination rights and the passage of laws challenging state authority. This argument persuasively reframes the situation from one of 'mere rhetoric,' which was the foundation of my initial forecast, to one of 'active preparation.' While the threats may still be conditional, these actions lower the barrier to an official announcement and signal a more serious phase in the secessionist project.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 10% to 20%. The primary driver for this update is the evidence, highlighted by Forecaster 3, that the Republika Srpska (RS) leadership has moved beyond rhetoric and is taking concrete legislative and constitutional steps to prepare for a potential declaration of independence. These actions, such as consulting on a new constitutional draft, represent a material change from the historical baseline of the past decade. While an announcement was always a tool of leverage, laying this groundwork makes the threat more credible and the act of officially scheduling a referendum a more plausible next step in an escalatory cycle. \n\nHowever, I am not raising my forecast to the level of Forecaster 3 (28%). The powerful deterrents that informed my initial forecast remain firmly in place. An announcement would trigger immediate and severe sanctions from the US and EU, jeopardize Bosnia's EU accession path (a stated goal of all parties), and almost certainly face opposition from Serbia, which is crucial for RS's survival. The economic and political costs are exceptionally high. Therefore, while the preparatory actions have increased the probability of an announcement in the short, two-month window, the fundamental strategic calculation for the RS leadership likely still weighs against crossing this red line. My updated 20% forecast now balances the powerful status quo factors against the clear evidence of increased, tangible escalation.",
