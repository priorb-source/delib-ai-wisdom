    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize Trump’s long-standing opposition to the Diversity Visa and his willingness to use presidential actions on immigration. They also highlight the short runway (about six weeks) and competing priorities. New considerations they surfaced that I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the DV-2026 results could be a potential trigger for attention, and early-term “pre-vetted” immigration actions could still be in the pipeline. However, I find their 30% too high given (a) the exact-phrase requirement (“Diversity Visa”) which is often avoided in favor of “diversity immigrant program/visa lottery/DV,” (b) the lack of any current reporting or leak about a DV-specific clause in an imminent EO/proclamation, and (c) the higher payoff for the White House to focus formal actions on border/asylum measures versus a relatively small legal immigration category likely to invite litigation. Their arguments don’t overcome the absence of signals within a tight window and the specificity hurdle.",
    "rationale": "- Time left/status quo: ~41 days remain. With no prior DV-specific presidential action in the first four months and no visible pipeline signals, the default is No. \n- Wording constraint: Resolution hinges on the exact phrase “Diversity Visa” appearing in a presidential action posted on WhiteHouse.gov. Historically, official texts often use alternative terminology, reducing hit probability even if the program is addressed.\n- Prioritization: Recent and expected immigration actions center on border enforcement/asylum/parole. A DV-focused clause is plausible but not a clear priority, and curtailing a statutory program via proclamation is limited and litigation-prone.\n- Base-rate/hazard: In any random six-week window, the chance of a presidential action that both touches DV and uses the exact phrase is low. Early-term activism raises the hazard somewhat, but four months without such action and no leaks suggest a low near-term probability.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of a draft EO/proclamation encompassing legal immigration categories that explicitly names “Diversity Visa,” White House press guidance teasing DV changes, or posted guidance from State/DHS previewing DV adjustments tied to an imminent presidential action. \n- What would move me down: Continued silence into late June and immigration actions that clearly omit DV.\nGiven the other forecasters’ point about early-term momentum, I marginally nudge up my estimate but remain well below 30%.",
