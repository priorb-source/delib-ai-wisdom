  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Only a handful of summer additions materialize (e.g., AUH, BCN, CPH, ARN, WAW), while key Gulf and European carriers remain suspended due to security and demand concerns. The flightsfrom.com BEY page rises into the mid-40s destinations but stays at or below 51 on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple major resumptions occur quickly and are loaded into schedules by July 1: Qatar Airways (DOH), Kuwait Airways (KWI), Saudia (JED/RUH/DMM), EgyptAir (CAI), Pegasus (SAW), and possibly other regionals; plus MEA brings back several seasonal Mediterranean/European leisure routes (e.g., Greek islands, Turkish resorts, additional Spanish/French/Italian airports). Combined, these push the listed destinations above 51 on flightsfrom.com.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The research assistant estimates about 39 active destinations in May 2025 (OAG), down from 53 in May 2024. Confirmed/likely summer adds include SAS to Copenhagen and Stockholm (June), Wizz Air Abu Dhabi (AUH) from June 4, MEA seasonal Barcelona from June 26, and LOT to Warsaw from July 1. Air France/Transavia and Emirates have already resumed (Paris CDG/ORY and Dubai), so those are baked in. These additions plausibly raise the count to roughly the mid-40s by early July, still well short of the >51 threshold.\nHeadwinds: Many carriers that suspended service after October 2023 have not returned (BA, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus; also noted absence of Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways). Passenger data show Q1 2025 traffic slightly down year-on-year, with weak departures and a steep drop in transit passengers, and Lebanon’s tourism ministry expects summer arrivals ~30% below 2019 levels. Security posture remains fragile (new airport security measures and bans on certain Iranian flights), and regional tensions continue to weigh on airline risk assessments and insurance costs. With only ~6 weeks to go, a large wave of resumptions looks unlikely.\nWhy not higher: Getting from ~39 to >51 requires 13+ net new destinations. Known additions account for perhaps five; the rest would need multiple Gulf and European resumptions plus a robust slate of MEA seasonal routes. Given current geopolitics, airline caution, and lead-time constraints for scheduling, that scenario seems improbable by July 1.\nWhy not lower: Some growth is already in train (SAS, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW). MEA could still announce or load additional seasonal leisure points that marginally increase the count. The flightsfrom.com methodology counts airports (e.g., CDG and ORY separately), which helps at the margin if more multi-airport cities are served.\nWhat would move me up: Officially published schedules (OAG/airline sites and visible on flightsfrom.com) showing returns by Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus, and/or several MEA seasonal Mediterranean/European destinations, bringing the visible list to 50+ by late June. A clear de-escalation in regional hostilities and withdrawal of travel warnings.\nWhat would move me down: Any renewed escalation causing fresh suspensions; cancellations of the already-announced additions; further regulatory/security restrictions impacting Iranian, Gulf, or Turkish market access.",
