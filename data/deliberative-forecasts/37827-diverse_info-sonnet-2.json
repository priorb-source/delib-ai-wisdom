    "review": "After reviewing both analyses, I find substantial agreement on the fundamental base rate calculation (all three of us landed in the 6-12% range), which validates the core analytical approach. However, there are important nuances to consider:\n\nForecaster 2 places significant weight on the January 2025 Rwanda report as a 'powerful piece of evidence.' While I agree it demonstrates African reports reach NUFORC, Forecaster 3 correctly identifies a critical uncertainty: we don't actually know if the Rwanda report was classified as a pilot report. The background merely states it was a sighting in Rwanda, not explicitly that it appears in NUFORC's pilot subindex. This distinction matters enormously for our forecast.\n\nForecaster 3's emphasis on multiplicative gates is well-taken - a pilot must witness something in Africa, in June specifically, report it to NUFORC (not local authorities), and NUFORC must tag it as a pilot report. Each gate reduces probability.\n\nOne valuable point from Forecaster 3 I had underweighted: the resolution allows for reports posted after July 1 as long as the occurrence date was June 2025. This provides additional time for submission and processing, marginally increasing the probability relative to requiring posting by end of June.\n\nForecaster 2's 12% seems to overweight a single uncertain data point. Without confirmation the Rwanda example was a pilot report, and absent evidence of a trend (multiple African pilot reports in early 2025), the significant jump from the historical base rate isn't justified.",
    "rationale": "My original 6% forecast was anchored on the 3.3-5% monthly base rate derived from historical data (4-6 African pilot reports over 120 months). Upon reflection, I believe this was slightly conservative for three reasons:\n\n1. The backfill consideration: Resolution checks on July 1+, meaning reports can be submitted and posted throughout June and even slightly after, rather than requiring posting by June 30. This modestly improves odds.\n\n2. Recent evidence of connectivity: While we can't confirm the Rwanda report was a pilot report, it does demonstrate that the reporting pathway from Africa to NUFORC exists and functions in 2025.\n\n3. Methodological alignment: Forecaster 3's independent Poisson-like reasoning arriving at 'mid-single-digit' probability validates my base rate approach, and 8% represents the upper end of that range.\n\nHowever, I remain unconvinced by arguments for going significantly higher. The historical data is clear and stable over a decade. A single recent report (of uncertain classification) doesn't establish a new trend. Africa's share of NUFORC pilot reports remains structurally low due to lower air traffic density relative to North America, limited NUFORC awareness among African pilots, and the specific requirement that reports be tagged as pilot reports.\n\nBalancing these considerations, a modest upward adjustment from 6% to 7% appropriately accounts for the backfill factor and recent evidence while maintaining fidelity to the dominant historical base rate.",
