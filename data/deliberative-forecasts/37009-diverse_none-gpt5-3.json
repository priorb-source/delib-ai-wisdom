    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds the argument that a rapidly clearing field and party desire to coalesce could accelerate a pre-planned launch, which I hadn’t explicitly weighted. That’s a plausible catalyst. However, the claim that this would translate into an announcement within 10 days, absent any leaks, staff movement, or local press chatter, feels overstated. In recent cycles, serious statewide launches are typically preceded by telltale signals. Forecaster 3’s reasoning aligns with my prior view: short runway plus no indicators implies the status quo (no announcement) remains most likely, while acknowledging that surprise announcements can happen under party pressure. Overall, I find F3 more convincing; F2 seems to overweight the coalescence dynamic and underweight the lack of observable prep and the logistical friction of a Senate rollout on such a tight clock.",
    "rationale": "We have ~10 days left. Without any reported exploratory activity, donor calls, staff hires, or media trial balloons tied to Stevens, the hazard rate for a sudden announcement remains low. The CNN context that several top-tier Democrats have bowed out does slightly raise the theoretical incentive for Stevens, but it doesn’t overcome the absence of pre-launch signals. If a launch were imminent, I would expect at least one credible local report hinting at timing or staffing by now. I also can’t rule out that party leaders are courting another figure, which would further discourage a rushed Stevens entry. Given that, I’m maintaining a low but non-trivial probability to account for genuinely rapid pivots under vacuum/pressure. No material new evidence from the deliberation compels a change in direction.",
