  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.\n\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025, which is less than two months from today's date of May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India. The diplomatic process regarding her extradition continues slowly, and she refrains from a high-risk voluntary return, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Indian government continues its deliberate pace in reviewing Bangladesh's extradition request, offering no decision before July 1. Facing a damning probe report from the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in late May, Sheikh Hasina's legal and political advisors convince her that a voluntary return is too dangerous. She remains in India to orchestrate her political future from abroad.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by the recent return of her political rival Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina decides she cannot afford to appear irrelevant or afraid. She makes a surprise voluntary return to Bangladesh in June to rally her supporters and face the charges against her, hoping to turn her trial into a political spectacle that galvanizes her base ahead of future elections.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant legal barriers and diplomatic inertia that weigh against Sheikh Hasina's return in the specified, narrow timeframe. The status quo is that she is in exile in India, which has not acted on an extradition request for several months. Such diplomatic procedures are typically protracted, especially concerning former heads of government, making an extradition before July 1 highly unlikely. Furthermore, the severe nature of the pending legal charges in Bangladesh—particularly the ICT's investigation into crimes against humanity, with a report expected this month—creates a powerful disincentive for a voluntary return. Returning would almost certainly lead to her immediate arrest and a trial with grave consequences. These two factors strongly favor a 'No' outcome. My probability is not lower than 15% because recent events have increased volatility. The return of her long-time rival, Khaleda Zia, on May 6, 2025, puts significant political pressure on Hasina. She may calculate that remaining in exile while Zia is politically active in Bangladesh is a greater long-term threat to her relevance and leadership. This could precipitate a high-risk, high-reward decision to return voluntarily. My probability is not higher than 15% because the personal and legal risks of returning are immediate and immense, and the timeframe is exceptionally short. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, either India must abruptly accelerate a complex diplomatic process, or Hasina must choose to walk into a legal firestorm. Both are plausible but improbable scenarios within the next seven weeks. I would increase my forecast if there is a definitive statement from India signaling an imminent extradition or credible reports that Hasina is making concrete preparations to travel. I would decrease it if the ICT formally issues an international arrest warrant, which could further complicate and slow any action by India.",
