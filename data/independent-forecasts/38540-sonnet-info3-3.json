  "information": "Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform that uses an Elo rating system based on user votes from anonymous, side-by-side model comparisons. A recent study titled 'The Leaderboard Illusion' raised concerns about the platform's fairness, suggesting major tech firms like OpenAI may have an advantage due to private testing, which allows them to selectively publish only their best-performing models to the public leaderboard. The operators of Chatbot Arena have responded to the study, stating that it contains factual errors and misinterpretations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days - the question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is that whatever model currently holds the #1 position on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard will maintain that position through the end of Q2 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A competitor model from Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Meta, or another provider currently holds or takes the #1 position and maintains it through July 1, 2025. Given the short timeframe, this most likely means a non-OpenAI model already holds #1 and simply maintains that position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (such as GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, or a newer release) either currently holds the #1 position and maintains it, or makes a rapid ascent in the final days of Q2 2025 to claim the top spot by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days remaining until resolution, the status quo is overwhelmingly important. Leaderboard rankings on Chatbot Arena are based on crowdsourced Elo ratings that accumulate over many user comparisons, meaning dramatic changes in such a short timeframe are unlikely without a major new model release. OpenAI has historically been highly competitive on benchmarks and maintains strong models, but faces serious competition from Anthropic's Claude models and Google's Gemini, both of which have topped various leaderboards in recent periods. The research assistant's note about potential advantages for major firms like OpenAI is interesting but doesn't dramatically affect the near-term forecast. Without current leaderboard data, I must estimate based on competitive balance: OpenAI is one of roughly 3-4 major players (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and potentially Meta) likely to hold the #1 spot. However, OpenAI's scale, resources, and track record suggest they're somewhat more likely than a random draw among competitors. The forecast isn't higher because strong competitors exist and have recently performed well, particularly Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The forecast isn't lower because OpenAI remains a technical leader with significant resources. To revise upward, I would need confirmation that an OpenAI model currently holds #1. To revise downward, I would need confirmation that a competitor firmly holds #1 or that OpenAI has fallen significantly in recent rankings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChatbot Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform that uses an Elo rating system based on user votes from anonymous, side-by-side model comparisons.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
