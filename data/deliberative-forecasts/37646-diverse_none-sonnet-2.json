    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the most critical new information: the license was announced in November 2023, meaning over 18 months have passed without service going live. This is a significant negative signal I had not properly weighted. Their emphasis on status quo bias and the extended delay as evidence of persistent obstacles is compelling. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies technical capabilities and Somalia-specific challenges, and rightly notes that Starlink can activate quickly. However, their 60% forecast seems to underweight the 18-month delay. The delay suggests that whatever obstacles exist - whether regulatory complexity, security concerns, or commercial readiness issues - have proven more intractable than a simple license approval would suggest. Both forecasters provided valuable context about typical rollout timelines and specific Somalia challenges that I should incorporate.",
    "rationale": "The 18-month delay since the November 2023 license announcement is the most important update to my analysis. This fundamentally changes my perspective from 'recent regulatory approval with tight timeline' to 'long-stalled project with diminishing probability.' Several factors explain why this delay matters: (1) If activation were straightforward, Starlink would have launched months ago given their demonstrated rapid deployment capabilities elsewhere; (2) The persistence of obstacles for 18 months suggests structural rather than temporary issues; (3) Status quo bias is powerful - each day without launch reduces the probability of launch in the remaining timeframe; (4) With only 47 days remaining, the window is narrowing rapidly. However, I maintain moderate probability rather than going extremely low because: (1) Starlink has demonstrated ability to activate countries with little notice; (2) We may be approaching a planned mid-2025 target; (3) The question only requires website status change, not full service launch; (4) Musk's direct announcement suggests executive attention. The balance of evidence suggests lowering my forecast significantly but not to the lowest range.",
