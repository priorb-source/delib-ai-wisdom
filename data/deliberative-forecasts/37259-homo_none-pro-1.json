    "review": "The two other forecasters arrived at the exact same conclusion (5%) based on the same two core arguments that I used: the newly elected Greenlandic government's 'gradualist' approach to independence and the extremely short timeframe before the question's resolution date. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own. They raised several excellent points that I had not explicitly articulated. Forecaster 2 noted the absence of media chatter or political rumors, which in itself is strong evidence against an imminent announcement. Forecaster 3 astutely pointed out that a government that just won an election on a gradualist platform would risk its political credibility by immediately calling for a referendum. Both points strengthen the argument for a 'No' outcome. Their scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome, such as announcing a referendum for a date far in the future or a major diplomatic incident with Denmark, are plausible but fall into the low-probability category of events that my initial 5% forecast was designed to capture.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other two forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has strongly reinforced my initial assessment. The consensus on the primary drivers (the government's political platform and the compressed timeline) gives me high confidence in our shared conclusion. The additional arguments raised by my colleagues—the lack of any media signals and the credibility risk to the government of a sudden policy reversal—have actually strengthened my conviction in the 'No' outcome. However, they do not persuade me to lower my forecast further. A 5% probability is already very low and appropriately accounts for the small but non-zero chance of an unexpected political event, such as a coalition crisis, a populist surge, or a sudden diplomatic dispute, which could force the government's hand. The scenarios provided by the other forecasters align well with this level of uncertainty. Therefore, I find no reason to adjust my forecast.",
