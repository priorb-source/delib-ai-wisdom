    "rationale": "This forecast faces substantial uncertainty due to limited available information just 14 days before the primary. The November 2024 Washington Post article confirms Jay Jones is a serious candidate who is actively campaigning for the position. As a former Delegate with political experience, he has the credentials for such a race. However, my research assistant provided no additional information about: (1) other candidates in the race, (2) polling data, (3) endorsements, (4) campaign momentum, or (5) his current standing relative to opponents. The fact that a primary is scheduled indicates there are multiple candidates competing. In democratic primaries without polling data or other indicators, base rates would suggest dividing probability among the number of candidates. With two candidates, that would be roughly 50%; with three, roughly 33%, and so on. Given we're so close to the election, if Jones were clearly leading or trailing, we would likely have some public information reflecting this. The absence of data could indicate either limited media coverage of the race or that it's relatively competitive. I'm forecasting 45% to reflect: high uncertainty given lack of information, recognition that he's a credible candidate worthy of major newspaper coverage, a slight discount from 50-50 odds because strong frontrunner status would likely generate more available information by now. My forecast would increase with: polling showing Jones leading, major endorsements, reports of strong fundraising or campaign organization. My forecast would decrease with: emergence of a well-known opponent, polling showing Jones trailing, negative news coverage, or withdrawal from the race.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
