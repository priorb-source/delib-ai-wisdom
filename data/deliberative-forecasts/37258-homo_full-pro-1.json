    "review": "The two other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core factors that make a 'Yes' outcome highly unlikely: the extremely short timeframe, the prohibitive legal and political landscape following the UK Supreme Court ruling, and the Scottish Government's recent strategic pivot towards domestic policy over an immediate referendum push. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns almost perfectly with my own, reinforcing the key arguments and landing on an identical 2% probability. Forecaster 3's slightly higher forecast of 5% is a valuable contribution, as it forces a more deliberate consideration of the main path to a 'Yes' outcome: a purely symbolic or political announcement designed to rally the base or respond to a crisis. While I find their reasoning for a low probability compelling, I am not convinced that this specific risk justifies increasing my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. The deliberation has strongly reinforced my initial assessment. All three forecasters agree that the substantive path to a referendum is blocked, and the timeline is exceptionally tight, further constrained by an embargo on major announcements until June 5. The key point of divergence is the probability of a purely symbolic announcement. Forecaster 3 places this risk at 5%, which I considered carefully. However, I believe this overstates the likelihood. Such a move would be a high-risk gamble, directly contradicting the Scottish Government's current strategic messaging which focuses on competence in managing the economy and public services. Announcing a referendum they cannot legally hold would invite immediate political and media attacks, portraying them as distracted from voters' real priorities. This seems counter-productive to their longer-term goal of building sustained majority support for independence ahead of the 2026 Holyrood elections. Therefore, while I acknowledge a symbolic gesture is the most plausible, albeit remote, scenario for a 'Yes' resolution, I believe my initial 2% forecast accurately reflects its very low probability.",
