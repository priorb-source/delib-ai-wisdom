    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The outcome will be determined when data for June 2025 is posted and accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Florida does not have the most pilot UFO sightings. Another state (likely California, Texas, or another high-aviation state) leads, or Florida ties with another state.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California, Texas, New York, or another state with high aviation activity has more pilot UFO sightings than Florida in June 2025. Alternatively, Florida ties with one or more states for the highest count, which also resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida uniquely has the most pilot-reported UFO sightings in June 2025, potentially driven by a concentration of unusual atmospheric phenomena, increased military aviation activity, or a cluster of sightings that gets reported by multiple pilots in Florida's airspace.",
    "rationale": "This question requires Florida to singularly lead all US states in pilot-reported UFO sightings for a single month (June 2025). Several factors make this challenging to forecast: (1) No historical baseline data is provided showing Florida's typical ranking among states for pilot UFO reports, (2) The criterion is highly specific - only pilot sightings count, not general public reports, (3) Multiple large states have substantial aviation activity that could generate reports (California, Texas, New York, Illinois). Florida does have favorable factors: major commercial airports (Miami, Orlando, Tampa), significant military aviation presence, year-round flying weather, and high tourism/flight volume. However, California likely has even higher total aviation activity, and Texas is comparable. Without data showing Florida consistently leads or has recent momentum in this specific category, the base rate probability should be relatively low - perhaps treating this as Florida being one of roughly 5-8 highly competitive states would suggest a 12-20% range. The tie-breaks-to-No rule further reduces probability. I'm not going higher because there's no evidence Florida typically leads this category. I'm not going lower because Florida's aviation volume and geographic factors make it plausible as a leader. To revise upward, I'd need data showing Florida recently led this category or has unusual June characteristics favoring sightings. To revise downward, I'd need data showing another state consistently dominates pilot reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
