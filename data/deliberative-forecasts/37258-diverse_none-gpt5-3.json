    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: very short timeline, strong status quo, UK Supreme Court constraint, and weak strategic incentives for the SNP to name a date it cannot deliver. Forecaster 2 adds the reputational cost after the missed 2023 target, which I already factored in; they slightly misstate the UK election timing but the conclusion (a Labour UK government opposed to a Section 30) is correct. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the absence of leaks or preparatory signals is a useful reinforcement. Both rightly note the resolution’s low bar (a symbolic announcement would still count), keeping the probability non-zero. Neither presents new concrete indicators of an imminent announcement. Their 5% and 8% are slightly higher than mine but rest on similar reasoning; I still view leadership caution under a minority government and the proximity to the 2026 Holyrood election as further dampeners on a symbolic gambit within 60 days.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations remain: (1) Time: <60 days is very little runway for a move of this magnitude absent telegraphed intent. (2) Strategy: John Swinney’s leadership has prioritized stability and competence over constitutional brinkmanship; a date announcement that cannot be enacted risks backfiring with swing voters and demoralizing supporters if it fizzles. (3) Institutions: The UKSC ruling and Starmer government’s stance close the legal pathway, increasing perceived futility. While legality is irrelevant for resolution, these constraints still heavily influence behavior. (4) Signals: No credible leaks, draft bill movement, or public hints of a timetable. (5) Incentives: With the 2026 Scottish election approaching, the SNP is unlikely to stake scarce political capital on a symbolic announcement now. A non-zero chance persists for a surprise symbolic move if polling spikes or internal pressures mount, but I see no new evidence of that. Triggers to move up would include: government statements foreshadowing a date, introduction of a referendum/timetable bill with a specified date, or multiple strong pro-independence polls alongside coordinated SNP-Green messaging. I therefore maintain a low single-digit probability.",
