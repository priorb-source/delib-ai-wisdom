    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released to the general public",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic does not announce Claude 4 in the remaining time, or announces it but only makes it available through a waitlist or early access program by the deadline. Alternatively, Anthropic continues iterating on Claude 3.5 variants rather than jumping to Claude 4.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces Claude 4 with immediate general availability in the next few weeks, or has been quietly preparing a release and launches it with full public access before July 1st. This could happen if development is complete and they decide on an aggressive rollout strategy to compete in the AI market.",
    "rationale": "With only 6 weeks remaining until the deadline, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Major AI model releases typically involve advance announcements, staged rollouts, and often initial access restrictions. The research assistant provided no information about any Claude 4 announcement or imminent release plans. Historical context shows Claude 3 was released in March 2024 and Claude 3.5 in June 2024, suggesting roughly annual major version cycles. We're currently in May 2025, which could theoretically align with another release, but the complete absence of public information about Claude 4 is significant. For a Yes outcome, Anthropic would need to either: (1) make a surprise announcement very soon with immediate general availability, or (2) have been secretly preparing a release. Both scenarios are possible but unlikely given industry norms around product launches and the need to generate buzz and prepare infrastructure. The probability is not lower because 6 weeks is technically sufficient time for a surprise launch, and companies occasionally deviate from expected patterns. It's not higher because there's no evidence of preparation, announcement, or leaks that typically precede major releases. I would update upward if credible reports of Claude 4 testing or announcements emerge, or downward if Anthropic announces focus on other models or timelines extending beyond July 1st.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
