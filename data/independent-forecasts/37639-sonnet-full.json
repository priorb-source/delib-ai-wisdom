  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Khalil remains protected from deportation by the temporary restraining order",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The temporary restraining order remains in effect through July 1, 2025, as the federal court takes time to consider the preliminary injunction motion. The legal process moves at its typical slow pace, with briefings, hearings, and appeals extending well beyond the resolution date. The court ultimately grants a preliminary injunction based on the plausible First Amendment claims.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal court quickly denies the preliminary injunction motion or allows the TRO to lapse. The Board of Immigration Appeals expedites its review and rules against Khalil. The habeas corpus petition is dismissed or mooted. With no legal barriers remaining and strong political pressure from the Trump administration, ICE swiftly executes the deportation order in mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. Just three days ago (May 11, 2025), a federal judge extended the TRO specifically because Khalil's First Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims were found 'plausible.' This is a meaningful legal finding that suggests his case has substantive merit. Federal TROs extended pending preliminary injunction decisions typically remain in place for weeks to months as courts consider complex constitutional questions. Legal processes, particularly those involving civil rights claims and immigration appeals, move slowly.\n\nKhalil has multiple layers of legal protection: (1) the active TRO in federal court, (2) a pending BIA appeal of the immigration judge's decision, and (3) a habeas corpus petition raising constitutional issues. For deportation to occur before July 1, essentially all these protections would need to fail within 6.5 weeks, which is highly unlikely given typical court timelines.\n\nHowever, several factors prevent me from going lower: The immigration judge already ruled in favor of deportation, establishing a legal basis for removal. The Trump administration has demonstrated aggressive action against pro-Palestinian activists, including revoking over 1,000 student visas. Political pressure from Marco Rubio and groups like Betar US shows government motivation to act quickly. Theoretically, 6.5 weeks is enough time if courts moved with unusual speed.\n\nWhy not higher: Federal courts provide strong procedural protections, and the judge's 'plausible' finding suggests Khalil's claims have merit. Even if the TRO were lifted immediately, a preliminary injunction hearing would likely follow. Multiple appeal mechanisms would need to fail simultaneously.\n\nWhy not lower: The deportation order exists, political will is evident, and while unlikely, rapid judicial action is possible. I would update upward if the TRO is lifted or if courts schedule expedited proceedings. I would update downward if a preliminary injunction is granted or if procedural delays accumulate.",
