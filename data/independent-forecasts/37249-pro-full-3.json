  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "60 days. The question resolves based on polling data published before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The resolution source, Politico's poll-of-polls, is a slow-moving aggregator that currently shows Reform UK at 14.1%, trailing Labour (33.7%) by nearly 20 points. Closing this gap and establishing a 4-point lead in two months represents a radical departure from the current aggregated data.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's surge in individual polls proves to be a temporary peak. Following the May 1st local elections, their performance is strong but not transformative enough to maintain momentum. While their average in the Politico aggregator rises, it either stalls behind Labour or fails to achieve the required 4-point margin before the July 1st deadline as support is split among several parties.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK achieves a landmark victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election and makes sweeping gains in the May 1st local councils. This validates their polling surge, creating a media narrative of a political realignment. Disaffected Labour and Conservative voters flock to Reform in subsequent polls throughout May and June, forcing the Politico aggregator to rapidly reflect this shift, showing Reform UK with a lead of 4 points or more by mid-June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant tension between fast-moving individual polls and the slow-moving aggregator used as the resolution source. The research indicates a dramatic surge for Reform UK in several recent polls, with some placing them ahead of the Labour and Conservative parties. This is fueled by deep voter disillusionment with the established parties. Today's local and by-elections serve as a major catalyst; a strong Reform showing could cement this surge and accelerate its reflection in the aggregated data. However, the status quo is a No. The Politico poll-of-polls shows a chasm of nearly 20 points between Labour and Reform. Overcoming such a deficit in an aggregator, which smooths out outliers, and establishing a further 4-point lead within a tight two-month window is an exceptionally high bar. My probability is not higher because of this statistical inertia of the resolution source and the high threshold for a 'Yes' outcome. It is not lower because the evidence of a genuine political realignment from multiple sources is compelling; the underlying conditions for a rapid shift are clearly in place, making a 'Yes' outcome a significant possibility, even if it remains the less likely scenario. I would significantly increase my forecast if Reform wins the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a large margin and multiple subsequent polls in May confirm them holding a national lead.",
