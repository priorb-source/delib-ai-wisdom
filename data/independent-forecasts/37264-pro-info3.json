  "information": "Recent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations. The advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025, which coincided with the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from the capital, Juba. The Level 4 advisory for the Democratic Republic of Congo cites high levels of violent crime, including armed robbery and kidnapping. The State Department also applies Level 4 warnings to sub-regions within countries, such as several states in Mexico and the Gaza Strip, due to localized risks of crime and armed conflict.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current US State Department travel advisory for Niger remains below Level 4 (e.g., 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel').",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Niger remains volatile but does not deteriorate to a degree that crosses the State Department's threshold for a nationwide Level 4 advisory. No major attacks occur in the capital and no order is given for the departure of US personnel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant escalation in violence or instability occurs, such as a major terrorist attack in Niamey, the capture of a provincial capital by insurgents, or a political crisis that prompts the US to order the departure of non-emergency government personnel, leading to an immediate upgrade to a 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high-risk security environment in Niger following the 2023 coup and the withdrawal of Western security partners, balanced against the typically slow-moving nature of travel advisory changes over a very short timeframe. The underlying conditions in Niger are poor; jihadist insurgencies are active, and the new military junta's alignment with Russia introduces further instability and reduces US visibility. As my research assistant noted, a Level 4 upgrade is often linked to a specific trigger event, such as an ordered departure of US personnel (as in South Sudan) or a sharp increase in violent crime targeting foreigners. While such an event is plausible in Niger's fragile state, predicting its occurrence within the next eight weeks is challenging. The world changes slowly, and bureaucratic decisions like this often require a significant shock to the system. My probability is not higher because the bar for a nationwide Level 4 advisory is high, and the short timeframe favors the persistence of the status quo. It is not lower because the security vacuum and political volatility make a rapid deterioration a very real possibility. I would raise my probability upon news of a major attack in the capital or an ordered departure from the US Embassy. I would lower it if the period passes without significant security incidents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
