    "review": "Both forecasters surfaced useful new details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: (1) a May 10 ceasefire with mutual drawdown (Forecaster 3), and (2) an explicit but conditional grant of retaliatory authority to India’s western commanders plus a defined diplomatic push window (May 21–June 5) (Forecaster 2). I find both arguments generally convincing. The ceasefire and troop withdrawals are strong de-escalatory signals that should push the probability down from my prior. The conditionality of India’s retaliatory authority also matters: it likely cues rapid, proportional responses to ceasefire violations near the LoC/IB—often in PoK or across the Jammu sector—rather than deliberate deep strikes in Pakistan proper. I also agree with F2 that India’s ongoing diplomacy suggests a preference to bank international support and deter further action, not necessarily to greenlight a June strike absent a trigger. Where I differ slightly from F3 is on keeping the probability as low as 10%: the recent precedent of strikes in Pakistan proper (per the RA) and elevated tensions argue for a non-trivial tail. And I diverge slightly from F2 by noting that punitive fire across the international border into Pakistan’s Punjab (e.g., Sialkot sector) could technically satisfy the resolution if it occurs and is credibly reported, even without a deep strike—so the conditional authority is not irrelevant to a Yes outcome. Overall, their inputs justify lowering my prior but not to the low teens.",
    "rationale": "Baseline risk is tempered by: (a) a fresh ceasefire (May 10) and signs of disengagement; (b) a defined diplomatic push through roughly June 5 indicating a de-escalatory posture; (c) nuclear deterrence and strong international pressure; and (d) the fact that India already exacted costs via Operation Sindoor/Sundar, which may have satiated domestic demands for retribution. The grant of ‘full authority’ appears reactive and scoped to ceasefire violations, which usually play out along the LoC/IB and often involve PoK—outside this question’s scope. That said, two paths to a Yes remain: (1) a significant terror attack in India credibly linked to Pakistan-based groups, prompting a Balakot-like strike into KP/Punjab/Baluchistan/Sindh; or (2) a severe ceasefire violation along the international border that triggers Indian punitive fire or UAV strikes landing in Pakistan’s Punjab or KP, and is publicly documented. The window after the diplomatic push (post–June 5) through late June is the likeliest period for any such move. I am lowering my forecast from 33% to 20% to reflect the ceasefire/drawdown and the conditional nature of India’s rules of engagement, while preserving a meaningful tail due to the elevated environment and recent demonstrated willingness to strike in Pakistan proper. I would revise up on: credible indicators of imminent Indian action (NOTAMs, airspace closures, force mobilization), breakdown of the ceasefire, or a major attack inside India. I would revise down on: visible CBMs/backchannel progress, sustained quiet along the LoC/IB into mid-June, or public softening of India’s rhetoric/measures.",
