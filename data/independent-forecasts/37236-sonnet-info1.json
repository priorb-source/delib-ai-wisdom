  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report about 6 weeks after the month ends, so April 2025 data should be released in mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - exports exceed April 2024 levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US exports in April 2025 remain at or below $262,578 million due to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners following Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs, a stronger US dollar reducing export competitiveness, or a sharp pullback in trade activity after the March import surge as businesses adjust to the new tariff regime.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "US exports in April 2025 exceed $262,578 million as the positive year-over-year growth trend continues (goods exports were up 6.8% in March 2025 vs March 2024), service exports remain robust, and US exporters maintain momentum despite tariff uncertainty. The threshold only requires exceeding 2024 levels, not dramatic growth.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports that US goods exports reached $180.8 billion in March 2025, up 6.8% year-over-year from March 2024. This is a strong positive trend. The question requires April 2025 total exports (goods plus services) to exceed $262.578 billion, which was the April 2024 level. Given that goods exports alone were $180.8B in March 2025, and services exports typically add $70-85B per month, total March 2025 exports were likely around $250-265B. The 6.8% YoY growth trend suggests April 2025 could reasonably exceed April 2024 levels even with modest month-to-month variation. However, Trump's tariffs implemented in early April 2025 introduce significant uncertainty. These could trigger retaliatory measures from trading partners that specifically target US exports. The article mentions these are 'liberation day' tariffs that sparked global response, suggesting potential for retaliation. The March data shows businesses were stockpiling imports before tariffs hit, but we don't yet know how April trade flows were affected. My forecast is not higher because: (1) we lack April data and tariff impacts are uncertain, (2) retaliatory measures could materialize quickly, (3) we only have goods export data, not total exports including services. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the underlying trend is strongly positive at 6.8% YoY, (2) the bar is simply to exceed prior year levels, not achieve high growth, (3) one month of tariffs may not fully reverse the trend. To update higher, I'd need evidence of strong service sector exports, limited retaliation, or early April indicators showing continued export strength. To update lower, I'd need evidence of significant retaliatory tariffs taking effect in April or early data showing export decline.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
