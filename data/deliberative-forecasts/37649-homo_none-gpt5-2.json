    "review": "Both analyses are broadly aligned with my priors: license secured in Nov 2024, ISL reduces ground-station dependency, but last-mile hurdles (type approval, customs, taxation, distribution) and batching of map updates can delay availability. Forecaster 2 leans on base rates and momentum to reach 60%, but offers no concrete launch signals; with only ~6.5 weeks left, that feels high. Forecaster 3’s framing matches mine: absent evidence of imminent activation, the short window favors a modestly sub-50% stance. No new hard evidence was presented that would materially raise odds.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~46 days from the deadline. Historical Africa rollouts post-license often land in a 3–9 month window, so a Q2 flip is plausible. However, Chad’s market/regulatory complexity and the lack of visible pre-launch signals (ETA on map, local distributor announcements, shipments clearing customs, government/Starlink comms) weigh against a near-term change. Starlink sometimes batches country activations late in quarters, which keeps a real path to Yes, but the short runway and status-quo inertia pull the estimate below 50%. Triggers that would move me up quickly: Starlink map shows a Q2 2025 target or preorders; credible local partner/government announcements; reports of terminals activating in Chad. Signals that would push me down: silence into late June, or an explicit push to later in 2025. Netting the base-rate plausibility against time-left and lack of signals, I’m holding near my prior.",
