  "information": "In multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company's CEO has recently and publicly stated that an IPO is 'not imminent' and that there are 'no specific plans' to go public.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's management continues to follow the path outlined by CEO Parker Conrad in May 2025. The company focuses on achieving profitability and providing liquidity to employees and early investors through private secondary sales. The July 1, 2025, deadline passes without an S-1 filing or an official IPO announcement on its website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the CEO's public statements, the company has been confidentially preparing for an IPO. A sudden and dramatic improvement in the IPO market for tech companies creates an unmissable window of opportunity. The board decides to accelerate the timeline and files an S-1 in late June 2025 to capitalize on the favorable conditions.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome primarily due to the recent and direct statements from Rippling's CEO, Parker Conrad, in May 2025. His assertion that the company has 'no specific plans to go public' and that an IPO is 'not imminent' provides a strong signal of the company's intentions in the very near term. The deadline for this question is July 1, 2025, which is only slightly more than a month away. Announcing an IPO, particularly through an S-1 filing, is a lengthy process; it is highly improbable the company would do so immediately after the CEO's comments. Furthermore, Conrad linked an IPO to achieving profitability, a milestone unlikely to be met in this short window. The company's stated plan to use annual secondary liquidity programs also reduces the immediate pressure to go public.\n\nThe probability is not lower (i.e., closer to 0) because CEO statements can sometimes be strategic misdirection to manage expectations while preparations continue in the background. A sudden, exceptionally favorable shift in the IPO market could theoretically accelerate a pre-existing, confidential plan.\n\nThe probability is not higher because the CEO's statements are very recent, direct, and provide a clear rationale (profitability milestone) that contradicts a near-term IPO plan. The evidence strongly supports the status quo.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if credible reports from major financial news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal) indicated an S-1 filing was imminent. I would become even more confident in 'No' if the company announced another secondary tender offer before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
