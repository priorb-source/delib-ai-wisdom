    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize timing and process inertia, which I agree is the dominant consideration for this resolution. Forecaster 2 adds a useful market-timing angle (a modest stock reaction to Trump’s Feb 13 opposition) and the point that Japanese acquirers are rarely prohibited outright by CFIUS, which tempers near-term block risk. Forecaster 3’s reference to reported “progress in merger talks” and notable activist long positions is a helpful counterweight to the political noise; if accurate, that reduces the likelihood of a quick walk-away. Both also correctly stress that a decisive external trigger is needed to force a pre–July 1 termination, and that even then companies may not immediately terminate. I’m aligned with their skepticism toward imminent abandonment and their focus on the outside date/extension terms and White House signals as key catalysts. I remain skeptical of the research assistant’s claim of an already-issued (but delayed) block; absent corroboration, I discount it heavily.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: about six weeks remain, and resolution requires not just an adverse development but an actual termination filing (8-K) before July 1. Base rates for outright CFIUS prohibition against a Japanese buyer are low, though political opposition (White House/Trump statements, union resistance) elevates risk. Markets price substantial deal risk (wide spread) but not an imminent, dated collapse. Even if a decisive adverse signal arrives in June, boards often pause to evaluate options, negotiate, or litigate, pushing any 8-K beyond July 1. I discount the assistant’s claim of a formal presidential block with delayed enforcement; without that, the most likely path is continued review/engagement rather than a June termination. I would move up if credible reporting indicated a CFIUS prohibition recommendation to the President or a clear order on a near-term timeline, or if merger agreement terms force a June outside-date decision with no extension. I would move down with evidence of mitigation progress, timeline extensions, or firm guidance that the parties will continue past July. Given the deliberation inputs, I keep my estimate near prior levels: political headwinds raise the tail risk, but process inertia and ally base rates keep pre–July 1 termination below even odds.",
