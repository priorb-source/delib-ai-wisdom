  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025, when the National UFO Reporting Center's data for June 2025 can be accessed and verified.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. If current trends continue, June 2025 will exceed 400 reports.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees an anomalous drop in reporting to 400 or fewer reports, possibly due to decreased public interest in UAP topics, technical issues with the NUFORC reporting system, unfavorable weather conditions limiting outdoor activities and sky observation, or some other factor that disrupts the established upward trend in reporting numbers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 continues the established pattern from early 2025 and recent years, with normal seasonal patterns of UFO sightings and sustained public interest in reporting unusual aerial phenomena. The month records more than 400 reports, consistent with the monthly average of approximately 517 reports observed in January-April 2025.",
    "rationale": "The historical data strongly supports a Yes outcome. Looking at June specifically: 2019 had 357 (below threshold), but 2020 had 470, 2021 had 407, and 2022 had 603. The trend is clearly upward. More importantly, my research assistant reports that all months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For 2025, the first four months averaged 517 reports per month, with each individual month exceeding 400. This represents a sustained high baseline well above the 400 threshold. The status quo strongly favors continuation of this trend, and good forecasters weight the status quo heavily since dramatic changes are rare without clear catalysts. I'm not forecasting higher (90%+) because: (1) we lack specific June 2023 and June 2024 numbers for direct month-over-month comparison, (2) there's always some inherent uncertainty in any forecast, and (3) random variation could theoretically produce a low outlier. I'm not forecasting lower (60-70%) because: (1) the recent trend is very strong and consistent, (2) every single month of 2025 has exceeded the threshold by substantial margins, (3) recent June months have consistently exceeded 400, and (4) there's no evidence of a declining trend or identifiable factor that would cause a sudden drop. I would update downward if May 2025 data shows a significant decline, or upward if specific June 2023-2024 data confirms they also substantially exceeded 400.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
