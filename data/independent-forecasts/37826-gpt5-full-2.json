  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.\n\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (window is June 1–30, resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No attack in Pakistan proper in June; the ceasefire largely holds and any Indian kinetic actions, if they occur, stay confined to Pakistan-administered Kashmir rather than Sindh/Balochistan/Punjab/Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ceasefire and de-escalation endure through June. Border incidents are limited or occur along the Line of Control/AJK where India conducts only localized, deniable or calibrated responses. Diplomatic outreach (May 21–June 5) proceeds without a triggering event, and both sides complete pullbacks to pre-conflict positions by end-May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant provocation in June—such as a mass-casualty terror attack in India linked to Pakistan-based groups, or a deadly Pakistani drone/missile strike/major ceasefire violation along the international border—prompts India to conduct air, missile, or artillery strikes inside Pakistan’s Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (e.g., Balakot-style) or to hit targets in Sindh/Balochistan, thereby clearly crossing into Pakistan proper during June.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo because, after sharp escalations, India–Pakistan crises historically tend to de-escalate under domestic cost-benefit calculations and international pressure. The most recent pattern fits that: following the April 22 Pahalgam attack and Indian retaliatory operations, both sides reportedly agreed to a ceasefire on May 10 with withdrawals to pre-conflict positions by end-May. India has simultaneously launched a diplomatic push (delegations May 21–June 5) and taken coercive non-kinetic steps (Indus Water Treaty suspension, border closure), all of which signal a preference to lock in gains without risking a broader war—unless provoked. \n\nKey points from the assistant’s report shaping this forecast:\n- India already executed strikes in late April/early May (some sources claim into Pakistan proper), but those are outside the June window. A ceasefire followed on May 10, with planned pullbacks by end-May—reducing near-term attack probabilities.\n- India’s political messaging (“no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail”) and the Army Chief giving Western Commanders ‘full authority’ to retaliate do raise the hazard rate if Pakistan violates the ceasefire. However, such retaliation is most likely to remain along the LoC or in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which would not satisfy this question’s criterion of Pakistan proper (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, KP).\n- Precedent for strikes in Pakistan proper (e.g., Balakot 2019) exists but is rare and typically follows a major provocation with casualties. International pressure after the recent flare-up makes a June repeat less likely absent a high-salience trigger.\n\nWhy not higher: \n- The ceasefire and planned force withdrawals point to de-escalation through June. \n- India’s ongoing diplomatic campaign overlaps early June; launching new strikes into Pakistan proper during this period would undercut that effort absent a clear trigger.\n- Crossing into Pakistan proper (especially via air/missiles) carries significant escalation risks; India can achieve signaling and deterrence via actions limited to the LoC/AJK instead.\n\nWhy not lower: \n- The environment remains elevated versus a normal month: fresh doctrine and delegated retaliatory authority, seasonal increases in infiltration attempts in summer, and a recent history of drone/missile incidents. A major June provocation (terror attack or deadly cross-border strike) could quickly reactivate Indian options into Pakistan proper.\n\nWhat would move me up: \n- A mass-casualty terror attack in India in June credibly linked to Pakistan-based groups; \n- Deadly Pakistani drone/missile strike or major artillery incident along the international border (Jammu–Sialkot sector) with Indian military/civilian casualties; \n- Observable military preparations: NOTAMs, unusual IAF dispersal, PAF/IAF high alert, evacuation of border areas, or explicit Indian warnings.\n\nWhat would move me down: \n- Verified completion of mutual withdrawals and a quiet early June; \n- Confidence-building steps, resumed backchannel talks, and strong external pressure messages from key partners; \n- Any Indian retaliations staying strictly within Pakistan-administered Kashmir despite provocations.\n\nBottom line: The most probable path is continued de-escalation with any kinetic responses, if needed, confined outside Pakistan proper. I allow a modest tail risk for a significant provocation triggering a Balakot-style or artillery/air response into Pakistan’s Punjab/KP in June.",
