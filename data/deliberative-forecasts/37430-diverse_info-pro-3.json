    "review": "The other forecasters provided crucial new information and perspectives. Forecaster 3's key insight was that the House of Representatives has already passed the bill. This is a significant development I had not considered, as it means a major legislative hurdle has been cleared. My initial analysis treated the bill as being at the start of the legislative process, making the timeline seem more daunting. Forecaster 2's point about specific opposition from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) on other parts of the bill is a valid risk factor for delay, making the general risk I had considered more concrete. Forecaster 3 also introduced the specific risk of the Eid al-Adha holiday in June reducing the number of available legislative days. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning, which balanced the positive momentum of House passage against the remaining procedural risks in the Senate, to be the most convincing. Forecaster 2's 30% seems too low now that we know one chamber has already passed the bill.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the strong executive push for a popular policy, balanced against the significant risk of legislative delay over a two-month period. The new information that the House has already passed the bill fundamentally changes the calculus. This is a major de-risking event, as it confirms momentum and removes one of the two main legislative obstacles.\n\nThe remaining hurdles are Senate passage and presidential assent. While the risks highlighted by the other forecasters—opposition from groups like the TUC to other parts of the omnibus bill, potential for amendments requiring harmonization, and a compressed legislative calendar due to the Eid al-Adha holiday—are real, I believe the existing momentum is strong enough to overcome them. The administration's publicly stated target for a July 1 implementation creates a powerful incentive and focal point for the Senate to act promptly. This is a key executive priority bill. When the Nigerian executive and legislative leadership are aligned, they can expedite legislation effectively.\n\nI am updating my forecast upward from 65% to 70%. The certainty of the bill having cleared the House outweighs the specific risks in the Senate. The path to enactment is now shorter and clearer. My initial forecast implicitly priced in the risk of failure in the House; with that risk removed, the overall probability of success before the deadline increases.",
