    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The official data for May 2025 is scheduled for release around June 15, 2025, which will resolve the question.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The outcome will be 'Yes'. The most recent data for April 2025 shows year-over-year growth of +1.49%. Given the significant momentum inherent in this economic indicator, a continuation of the recent trend would result in another month of positive growth.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if there was a sharp, unexpected economic shock in May 2025. This could include a major supply chain disruption, a sudden tightening of financial conditions that curtails manufacturing activity, or an abrupt drop in consumer and business demand, causing output to fall sufficiently to register negative year-over-year growth.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is the most likely scenario, where the economic momentum from April carries through May. Supported by stable demand, continuing investment, and the absence of any major negative shocks, industrial output would continue to expand, resulting in a year-over-year growth rate greater than 0.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the principle of inertia in macroeconomic data. The most recent available data point for US Industrial Production, for April 2025, showed a solid +1.49% year-over-year growth. Given that the month of May 2025 has already concluded and there have been no reports of major economic shocks—such as natural disasters, widespread strikes, or financial crises—it is highly probable that this positive trajectory continued. The absence of negative information is a key factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher because monthly economic data contains inherent volatility. A combination of minor, unobserved sector-specific downturns or a particularly strong base from May 2024 could erode the growth margin, even if the overall economy remains stable. There is a small chance the final figure could fall into slightly negative territory due to this statistical noise.\n\nMy probability is not lower because a drop from +1.49% to a negative reading in a single month is a significant reversal that would typically require a clear, identifiable cause. Without evidence of such a shock, discounting the strong existing momentum would be imprudent. \n\nI would revise my forecast downwards if any lagging data for May released before June 15th (e.g., flash PMIs, energy consumption data) were to indicate a sudden, sharp contraction. Conversely, stronger-than-expected data would increase my confidence and probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
