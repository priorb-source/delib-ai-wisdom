    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Under 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Greenland will not have officially announced a date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current Siumut-led coalition government continues its stated 'gradualist' approach to independence, prioritizing economic and social issues. The short timeframe to the deadline passes without the political consensus or impetus needed to schedule such a significant vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected political crisis, such as a major disagreement within the ruling coalition or a surge in public pressure, forces the Premier to announce a referendum date as a political maneuver to shore up support, even if the proposed date is years in the future.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary factors: the political stance of the current Greenlandic government and the extremely short time remaining before the resolution date. First, the government is led by the Siumut party, which won the recent election on a gradualist platform for independence, prioritizing economic development before a vote. This indicates a low appetite for scheduling a referendum in the immediate future. Second, with less than two months until July 1, 2025, the window for such a monumental political announcement is closing rapidly. Scheduling an independence referendum typically requires significant political groundwork, debate, and legislative action, none of which appears to be currently underway. The status quo is strongly in favor of no announcement. My forecast is not lower than 5% because politics can be unpredictable; a sudden internal coalition crisis or an external event could change the leadership's calculations, making a surprise announcement a low-probability but not impossible event. My forecast is not higher because the declared policy of the governing party and the lack of time create a formidable barrier to a 'Yes' outcome. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a breakdown in the governing coalition, a significant shift in Siumut's public stance, or large-scale public mobilization demanding a referendum now.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
