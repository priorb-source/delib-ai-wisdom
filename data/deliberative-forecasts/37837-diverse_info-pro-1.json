    "review": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. Forecaster 2's analysis is unfortunately based on demonstrably incorrect data. Their claims that monthly reports in 2023 exceeded 600 and in 2024 exceeded 450 are contrary to the actual NUFORC data, which shows totals for those years consistently in the 200s and 300s. For example, June 2023 had 260 reports, and June 2022 had 326. Because Forecaster 2's entire rationale is built on this faulty premise, I must disregard their 82% conclusion completely. In sharp contrast, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning to be excellent and highly convincing. Their analysis aligns with my own regarding the recent downward trend in reporting. Crucially, they introduced a key factor I had not considered: the reporting lag. The resolution cutoff on July 1 means that reports for events late in June might not be posted in time to be counted, creating a slight downward bias that favors a 'No' outcome. This is a sophisticated and persuasive point about the mechanics of the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was based on the strong evidence of a recent downward trend in reports, with monthly totals since the beginning of 2023 consistently remaining below the 400 threshold. This established a status quo that favors a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis has reinforced this view and provided a new, compelling reason to be even more confident in it. The point about the July 1 resolution cutoff potentially excluding late-June reports due to processing lag is a structural factor that makes exceeding the 400-report threshold slightly more difficult. It strengthens the case against a 'Yes' resolution. While I still acknowledge the potential for a spike in reports from a major catalyst like a well-publicized Starlink launch train or the 'Contact in the Desert' conference, the baseline trend is strong and now supplemented by this mechanical bias toward a lower count. Therefore, I am updating my forecast downward to reflect this new insight provided by Forecaster 3. The change is minor as it refines, rather than overhauls, my original position.",
