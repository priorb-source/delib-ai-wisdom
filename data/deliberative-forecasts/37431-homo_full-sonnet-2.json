    "review": "All three forecasters arrived at remarkably similar conclusions (40-45%), working from the same evidence and identifying the same key factors. This clustering suggests we're properly capturing the probability space. Forecaster 2 (45%) takes a slightly more optimistic view, emphasizing that 68 days is 'just below' the 70-day median. Forecaster 3 (40%) takes the most cautious stance, strongly emphasizing status quo bias after 11 days with no apparent progress and highlighting frozen products as creating 'inherent delays.' Neither forecaster raised fundamentally new evidence I hadn't considered, but Forecaster 3's emphasis on two points deserves attention: (1) after 11 days the recall remains active with no indication of imminent closure, and (2) frozen products create persistent verification challenges that may be underweighted in the historical averages. The geographic limitation to New York remains a significant advantage, but the 17-month production window and frozen nature are genuine complications that could push this toward the longer end of the distribution.",
    "rationale": "My original 42% forecast properly identified the core tension: we're near the 50th percentile of historical closure times (70 days) but with specific characteristics that could skew toward longer duration. The tight clustering of all three forecasts (40-45%) validates this reasoning rather than challenging it. However, Forecaster 3 makes valid points about the challenges of frozen product recalls. Items can remain in consumer freezers for months, making complete removal verification genuinely difficult. Additionally, after 11 days with the recall still in Active status and no public signs of progress, the remaining 57-day window requires relatively swift completion of effectiveness checks and verification processes. The favorable factors (NY-only distribution, allergen classification, voluntary recall, no illnesses) remain meaningful, but the frozen product nature and extended production window deserve slightly more weight. I'm adjusting marginally downward to 41% to acknowledge these challenges while recognizing that 68 days still sits reasonably close to the historical median.",
