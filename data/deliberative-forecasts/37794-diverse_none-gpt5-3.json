    "review": "- Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the short timeline and an active candidate, but 40% feels too high given how hard it is to sustain ≥.400 over ~40–50 AB unless the player is far above .400 now. They don’t address ESPN’s likely default of “qualified” leaders, which materially lowers the chance.\n- Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing and regression argument are solid and closer to my view. I agree that by mid-May most fluky .400s fade, and any rise from ~.380 to .400 in two weeks is very unlikely. They also don’t discuss the qualified-vs-non-qualified issue.\n- New/useful points: citing Chipper (2008) and Arraez (2023) as precedents shows a non-zero base, but those are rare and typically involve elite contact hitters with unusual BABIP stretches.\n- Overall, I find the 10% argument more convincing than the 40%.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers:\n- Timeline and math: If a hitter sits at exactly .400 on ~May 19 with ~150–170 AB, they typically need to hit about .400 over the next ~45 AB to remain ≥.400 on June 1. For a true-talent .300–.330 hitter, that tail probability is roughly 10–20% for that span; if the current AVG is a bit above .400 (e.g., .410), the requirement relaxes slightly (perhaps ~.380 needed), pushing the chance per candidate into the mid-teens. If there’s only one serious candidate, the overall probability remains in that ballpark. \n- Base rate: Qualified hitters at ≥.400 on June 1 are rare in the modern era. It happens, but not often. The snap-shot nature helps, but we’re already far enough into the season that small-sample buoyancy is diminished.\n- ESPN qualification ambiguity: If resolution uses ESPN’s default “qualified” filter, odds are lower; a non‑qualified part‑timer above .400 is less likely to be displayed. The prompt’s tone (and the example article) suggests focus on a headliner/qualified hitter.\n- Multiple candidates: If there were two legitimate ≥.400 candidates with substantial PA today, the chance might approach ~25–30%, but we lack evidence of that. Assuming at most one main contender, the 10–20% range is appropriate.\n\nGiven the above, I edge my prior 12% slightly upward to 15% to reflect the plausibility of one active .400 candidate and the short window, while staying well below 40% due to regression and qualification considerations.",
