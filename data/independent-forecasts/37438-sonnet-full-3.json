  "information": "Based on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.\n\nIn February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California. The company is also launching a new AC Level 2 charging technology with bidirectional capabilities, scheduled for release in Europe by summer 2025 and in North America by the end of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, from May 5, 2025 until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint continues operating without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint maintains its current trajectory with $225.6 million in cash reserves and a reduced quarterly cash burn of $3 million. The company manages through near-term challenges, addresses the NYSE non-compliance through a reverse stock split if needed, and continues operating normally through July 1, 2025 without any bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint experiences an unexpected severe liquidity crisis within the next two months due to factors such as: massive acceleration in cash burn from unforeseen operational issues, loss of major contracts, discovery of significant hidden liabilities, inability to access expected funding, or regulatory/legal issues requiring immediate large payments that exhaust cash reserves and force a bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The financial data strongly suggests ChargePoint will not file for bankruptcy in the next 57 days. Key supporting factors: (1) Substantial cash position of $225.6 million as of January 31, 2025; (2) Dramatically improved cash burn of only $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in Q3; (3) No debt maturities until 2028; (4) Recent positive developments including $19 million in NEVI funding secured in May 2025. Even if cash burn were to increase substantially from Q4 levels, the company has sufficient runway for many quarters. The NYSE non-compliance notice relates to stock price, not liquidity, and is commonly resolved through reverse stock splits without bankruptcy implications. Challenges exist (declining revenue, EV market headwinds, federal funding pauses) but none create imminent bankruptcy risk within 2 months. My forecast is not at 0% because unforeseen black swan events could theoretically occur (fraud, major hidden liabilities, catastrophic operational failures), but these would need to be severe and immediate. The forecast is not higher because the financial runway is objectively substantial relative to the timeframe, cash burn trends are improving not deteriorating, and the company just secured additional funding days ago. I would update higher only with evidence of dramatic cash acceleration or previously undisclosed liabilities emerging. I would update lower with additional capital raises or further operational improvements.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
