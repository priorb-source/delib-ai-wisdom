    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the most significant new information: as of May 2, 2025 (only 5 weeks ago), bilateral talks were focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. This is crucial recent evidence about the actual negotiation trajectory, as opposed to public political rhetoric. If the parties were actively working on modification just 5 weeks ago, a complete pivot to formal cancellation within 24 days represents a dramatic and unlikely shift. This contradicts the narrative that cancellation is imminent. Forecaster 2 also correctly identifies Turkey's opposition and the debt settlement requirement as structural barriers. Forecaster 3's points about Bulgaria's energy diversification and alternative sources are valid but reflect long-term strategic positioning rather than near-term cancellation triggers. The permissive resolution criteria (unilateral announcement counts even if disputed) is noted by both Forecaster 3 and myself, but doesn't overcome the core issue: no movement toward cancellation announcement despite only 24 days remaining. All three of us converge on the same fundamental tension - severe financial distress versus strong status quo bias in a compressed timeframe - but Forecaster 2's May 2 information tips the balance more strongly toward status quo.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the May 2, 2025 negotiation information significantly undermines the case for imminent cancellation. Five weeks ago, both parties were pursuing modification rather than termination. For cancellation to occur within 24 days would require: (1) complete breakdown of renegotiation talks since May 2, (2) decision by one or both parties to formally cancel, (3) public announcement of that decision - all within an extremely compressed timeline. The fact that no announcement has occurred yet, despite months of financial crisis and political pressure, suggests strong institutional inertia. The pathway to Yes now requires either catastrophic financial collapse forcing unilateral Bulgarian announcement, or unexpected Turkish decision to terminate - both low probability in 24 days given the May 2 baseline. My original 22% gave too much weight to the severity of financial distress and too little to the recent evidence of negotiation trajectory. The combination of: (1) May 2 talks focused on modification, (2) zero announcements despite ongoing crisis, (3) only 24 days remaining, (4) diplomatic complexity between state entities, points toward lower probability. I'm revising down to 15%, acknowledging that genuine bankruptcy risk prevents going as low as single digits, but the recent negotiation track argues against my initial 22%.",
