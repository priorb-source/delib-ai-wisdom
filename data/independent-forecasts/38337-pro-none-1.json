    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled to be released on Thursday, June 26, 2025. This is approximately 3 weeks from today's date of June 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current trend shows a gradual loosening of the labor market, with the four-week moving average for initial claims hovering slightly above 220,000. If this trend continues without change, the weekly figure would likely exceed the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market demonstrates unexpected resilience. Positive economic data or a temporary pause in layoffs by several key industries causes the number of initial claims for this specific week to dip below the 220,000 mark, even if the broader cooling trend remains intact.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The established trend of a gradually cooling labor market persists. Normal weekly fluctuations, potentially influenced by modest layoff announcements from one or more sectors, keep the initial claims figure above the 220,000 threshold, in line with the recent trend.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current economic environment where the labor market is displaying a clear, albeit slow, cooling trend due to the lagged effects of restrictive monetary policy. As of early June 2025, initial jobless claims have been volatile but the four-week moving average has been trending in the 220,000-225,000 range. This established trend makes the status quo a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 55% because weekly jobless claims data is notoriously noisy. A single week can easily deviate from the underlying trend. The labor market has also been remarkably resilient, and a brief period of stability or strength could easily push the number for this specific week below the 220,000 threshold. The threshold is very close to the current central tendency, making this almost a 50/50 proposition decided by short-term noise.\n\nConversely, my probability is not lower than 50% because the macroeconomic headwinds supporting a softer labor market are significant. For claims to fall below 220,000 would require a deviation from the established trend, which is less likely than a continuation of it. The path of least resistance points to claims remaining in their current, slightly elevated range.\n\nTo raise my forecast, I would need to see the claims data for the preceding weeks in June come in higher, for instance above 235,000, or see other data like the monthly jobs report show a more significant slowdown. To lower my forecast, I would need to see the preceding weekly claims dip consistently below 215,000, suggesting the cooling trend has stalled or reversed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
