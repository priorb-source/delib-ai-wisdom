    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable specific intelligence about countries in the pipeline. Forecaster 2 identifies Nigeria (targeting end-May exit), Mozambique (completed April on-site visit with positive feedback), and South Africa (20/22 action items complete, targeting October). Forecaster 3 highlights the British Virgin Islands as a strong addition candidate with expired grace period and UK non-opposition. This concrete information about multiple specific candidates actually strengthens rather than weakens the case for change.\n\nHowever, both forecasters forecast significantly lower (70-72%) than my 92%, primarily citing execution risk - that countries may not complete ALL requirements by June despite progress, and that international diplomatic processes involve timing uncertainties. They note that even strong candidates like BVI could face procedural delays.\n\nThe key tension: I weighted the 94% historical base rate heavily, while they appear to discount it substantially for execution risk. I need to consider whether their caution is justified or whether they're over-discounting a very strong pattern.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial forecast was well-grounded but slightly overconfident. The 94% historical base rate (16/17 plenaries with changes) remains the strongest evidence. The single exception was October 2020 under COVID-19 - circumstances clearly not present in June 2025. The February 2025 plenary demonstrates normal operations with changes occurring.\n\nThe new specific information about Nigeria, Mozambique, and BVI actually reinforces my confidence. These represent multiple independent pathways to resolution: (1) Nigeria removal, (2) Mozambique removal, (3) BVI addition, (4) any other jurisdiction completing requirements or being newly identified. The question requires only ONE change from ANY of these possibilities.\n\nHowever, the other forecasters raise a legitimate concern about execution risk that I should weight more heavily. Even with strong progress, countries must complete ALL action items and pass verification. South Africa's self-targeting of October rather than June is telling - countries themselves may know they need more time. Nigeria's 'end of May' target cutting it close for a June plenary decision.\n\nThe historical base rate already incorporates similar execution risks from previous plenaries, so I shouldn't discount it too heavily. But two experienced forecasters independently arriving at 70-72% suggests I may be underweighting implementation uncertainty. I'll update modestly downward to 87%, showing deference to their concerns while maintaining confidence in the strong historical pattern supported by multiple specific catalysts.",
