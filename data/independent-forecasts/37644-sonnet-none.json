    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Anthropic has not announced IPO plans and remains a private company",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues operating as a private company, relying on the robust private funding market that has supported its $40 billion valuation. The company focuses on product development and AI research without the regulatory burdens and public scrutiny of being public, and makes no IPO-related announcements before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's leadership decides to accelerate public market timing due to strategic factors (such as capitalizing on peak AI market interest, competitive positioning against potential OpenAI moves, or liquidity needs). The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or announces IPO plans on their website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe of 46 days is the dominant factor in this forecast. IPO preparations typically require months of intensive work including financial audits, regulatory filings, legal reviews, and board approvals. There are currently zero public signals of such preparation. The recent $40 billion private valuation suggests Anthropic is still comfortable accessing private capital markets, which have been exceptionally liquid for leading AI companies. OpenAI, Anthropic's main competitor, remains private despite even higher valuations, indicating no competitive pressure to go public. The research assistant provided no information suggesting imminent IPO plans. The question only requires an announcement (not a completed IPO), which slightly increases the probability, but even announcements require substantial preparation and board decisions that typically leave paper trails. For this probability to be higher, we would need credible reports of investment bank selection, audit preparation, or executive statements about public market timing. For it to be lower, we would need explicit statements about remaining private or news of fresh private funding rounds. The 4% probability reflects the small but non-zero chance of a surprise announcement while heavily weighting the status quo given the absence of any supporting evidence and the compressed timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
