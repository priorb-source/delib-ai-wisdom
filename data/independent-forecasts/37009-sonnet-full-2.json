  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9-10 days. The question resolves on May 1, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan as of April 21, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens delays her announcement beyond May 1 due to ongoing strategic considerations, additional fundraising needs, staff coordination issues, or reconsideration of her candidacy given the competitive field. Alternatively, she decides not to run at all despite the preparations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens announces her Senate candidacy within the next 9 days, consistent with the Politico report from April 19 stating she is 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' She makes the announcement after finalizing staff arrangements and campaign infrastructure preparations.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests an imminent announcement is likely. The April 19 Politico report specifically states Stevens is 'widely expected to declare... as early as next week,' which from that date would place an announcement around April 26-27, well before the May 1 deadline. This is reinforced by tangible preparation signals: $1.6M in campaign funds, $1.2M raised in Q1 2025, expanded campaign staff, and outreach to potential House seat replacements. However, some uncertainty exists. Other sources use the more ambiguous language 'in the coming weeks' (plural), which could extend past May 1. Additionally, Stevens has not yet filed FEC paperwork for an exploratory committee, though this isn't required before an announcement. The status quo is that she hasn't announced yet, and political announcements can be delayed for various strategic reasons. My forecast is not higher (85%+) because 'as early as next week' isn't a guarantee, political timing is inherently uncertain, and delays happen. It's not lower (55% or below) because the Politico reporting is specific and credible, the preparation signals are strong, and we have sufficient time (9 days) within the window. I would update higher if Stevens files FEC paperwork or if additional reporting confirms a specific announcement date. I would update lower if reporting emerges about unexpected delays or if we pass April 27 without an announcement.",
