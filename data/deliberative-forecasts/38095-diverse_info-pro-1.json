    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was based on the high average monthly rate of clemencies in Trump's second term. The other forecasters introduced crucial new information and reasoning that I had not considered. Forecaster 2's analysis was most persuasive, highlighting the 'cluster and lull' pattern of clemency grants. The new information that a large clemency blitz occurred in late May strongly supports this theory, making a June 'lull' much more plausible than my initial analysis suggested. I found this argument highly convincing. Forecaster 3 introduced another important data point: Trump granted zero clemencies in June during his entire first term. While I am cautious about overweighting first-term data given the dramatically increased volume of the second term, this historical pattern provides additional evidence that June may be a quiet month. Forecaster 3's probability of 30% seems too low, as it appears to anchor too heavily on the first-term base rate while the evidence points to a fundamentally different process in the second term. Both forecasters correctly emphasized that the low threshold of '>2' remains a significant factor pushing toward a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 85% to 60%. The primary reason for this large update is the new information about the late-May clemency spree. My initial model assumed a steady monthly flow of clemencies based on the high average rate since January 2025. This new data point, combined with Forecaster 2's compelling 'cluster and lull' argument, fundamentally changes that assumption. It is now more likely that the administration processes clemencies in large batches, and having just released one, they may pause through June before another potential batch around a holiday like July 4th. Forecaster 3's point about zero June clemencies in Trump's first term adds weak but corroborating support for the idea of a June lull.\n\nHowever, I am keeping my forecast above 50% for two main reasons. First, the threshold of 'more than 2' is extremely low. The pipeline of vetted cases is clearly full (as evidenced by the May blitz), and it would only take a single small action—perhaps pardoning the two signaled Whitmer-plot individuals plus one other person—to resolve this question as 'Yes'. Second, the entire posture of the second-term administration on clemency is one of high volume and continuous action, which makes a complete month-long pause less likely than it was in his first term. My updated forecast of 60% reflects a balance between the strong possibility of a post-blitz lull and the very low threshold for a 'Yes' outcome.",
