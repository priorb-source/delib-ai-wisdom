  "information": "Erbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Erbil typically has several dozen direct destinations, and summer schedules add more)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security or regulatory disruptions lead multiple airlines (especially Turkish, Gulf, and European carriers) to suspend routes, or FlightsFrom lists only 31 or fewer destinations on July 1 due to cancellations or reclassification of seasonal/charter services.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer 2025 seasonal services (e.g., Turkish coastal cities, additional Gulf/Europe routes) are active and listed on FlightsFrom, keeping the total at 32+ destinations; ongoing operational upgrades and stable security allow carriers to maintain or add routes.",
    "rationale": "- Definition: The question resolves by the number of unique non-stop destinations shown on FlightsFrom’s EBL page on/after July 1, 2025. Threshold is >31 (i.e., 32+).\n- Status quo weighting: Airports like Erbil usually change route maps gradually; summer schedules add seasonal leisure routes. My base expectation is that EBL already hovers around the low-to-mid 30s and tends to peak in summer, so the status quo favors a Yes.\n- Evidence and recent signals: The research assistant notes operational upgrades (night landings, ICAO inspection) that signal institutional momentum, plus demonstrated capacity during Hajj. While pure Hajj charters may not count on FlightsFrom, the broader readiness and policy posture support maintaining/adding scheduled services. The referenced article about a promising Summer 2025 aligns with higher seasonal demand and more destinations.\n- Why not higher: 1) FlightsFrom may not include certain limited or charter-like operations; 2) regional security/tension risks can cause abrupt suspensions (particularly with Iran–Iraq–Kurdistan dynamics); 3) airline network adjustments or economic pressures could trim thin European or Turkish seasonal routes; 4) the live FlightsFrom listing on the specific date is a hard, third-party snapshot that can undercount last-minute services.\n- Why not lower: 1) Strong base of Gulf, Turkish, Jordan/Lebanon, Egypt, domestic Iraqi destinations provides a robust floor; 2) summer seasonal additions typically push the count higher; 3) recent operational improvements reduce the likelihood of capacity-related constraints.\n- What would move me up: Verified June schedules on FlightsFrom showing 34+ distinct destinations for July; announcements from Turkish leisure carriers (SunExpress, Pegasus) and Gulf/European carriers adding summer frequencies/destinations; absence of new security incidents.\n- What would move me down: News of sustained suspensions by multiple carriers (e.g., Turkish Airlines/Pegasus, Gulf Air/flydubai/Air Arabia), security-driven airport restrictions, or FlightsFrom showing ≤31 in late June test checks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
