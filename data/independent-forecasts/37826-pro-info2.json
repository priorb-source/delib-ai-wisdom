  "information": "After India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (the outcome will be known after June 30, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current trend is de-escalation, with a ceasefire in place and troop withdrawal underway. If this trend continues, there will be no Indian kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May 10th ceasefire holds throughout June. Both India and Pakistan complete the agreed-upon troop withdrawals to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May. Diplomatic back-channels, possibly with international encouragement, succeed in managing tensions. No major provocation, such as a large-scale terrorist attack, occurs, removing any immediate justification for India to launch a new offensive.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-casualty terrorist attack takes place in India that is credibly linked to a Pakistan-based militant group. In response to intense domestic pressure and to re-establish deterrence, the Indian government authorizes a limited, punitive kinetic strike (e.g., an airstrike or special forces raid) against a specific target, like a terrorist training camp, located within Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in early June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo of de-escalation. The most critical information is the ceasefire agreed upon on May 10, 2025, and the subsequent agreement for both sides to withdraw troops. This indicates a mutual desire to step back from the brink of a wider conflict after the May flare-up. Nuclear-armed states have immense incentives to avoid prolonged escalations. Therefore, in the absence of a new, significant shock to the system, the ceasefire is likely to hold through June.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 10% because the situation remains volatile and the ceasefire is recent and potentially fragile. The India-Pakistan relationship is characterized by deep-seated mistrust and a history of rapid escalation. A significant provocation, most plausibly a major terrorist attack in India traced back to Pakistan, could swiftly reverse the current de-escalation trend. India's government has demonstrated a political willingness to use cross-border kinetic force in response to such events in the past (e.g., 2019 Balakot airstrike).\n\nThe probability is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome is contingent on a new triggering event that breaks the current de-escalatory momentum. A unilateral, unprovoked Indian attack is extremely unlikely given the risk of a full-scale war and international condemnation. For the forecast to move higher, we would need to see credible intelligence of an impending large-scale terrorist attack or a breakdown of the ceasefire agreement. Conversely, my forecast would move lower if high-level diplomatic talks were publicly announced and the troop disengagement process was confirmed as complete by both sides.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
