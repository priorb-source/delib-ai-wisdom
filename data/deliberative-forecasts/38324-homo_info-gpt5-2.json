    "review": "Forecaster 2 puts heavy weight on the recent run‑rate and infers the status quo is an upward drift to ≥$37T by late June. I don’t find that convincing because it implicitly downplays the binding debt ceiling: under extraordinary measures, Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO) does not follow the usual trend; it stays pinned near the reinstated cap until Congress acts. Their cited January level (~$36.2T) is plausible, but using normal growth from there to project a late‑June crossing overlooks that the ceiling blocks increases in the reported total. Forecaster 3’s argument better incorporates the short window, mid‑June receipts, and the possibility of binding constraints; I broadly agree with their direction but think 20% is still high given Congress’ usual tendency to act near the X‑date rather than weeks early. The useful correction I take from both is the likely starting point around ~$36.2T (I had implicitly treated the level as lower), which reduces the required step‑up to ~+$0.8T, not ~$1.5–$2.0T as I previously suggested. That narrows the gap conditional on a resolution, but does not change the need for pre‑June 27 legislative action.",
    "rationale": "Key elements: (1) The debt limit was reinstated Jan 2025 and Treasury has been using extraordinary measures. (2) Yellen signaled those measures would last at least into late June; BPC’s X‑date window is mid‑July to early October. This makes it unlikely Congress acts before June 27. (3) If Congress does act before June 27, the required increase from ~36.2T to 37.0T (~$0.8T) could be achieved via rapid catch‑up: in 2023 TPDO rose ~$360B the next business day and ~$600B within a week as trust funds were replenished, with additional TGA rebuild thereafter. A mid‑June resolution could plausibly push TPDO above $37T by June 27; a late‑June resolution (e.g., June 25–27) leaves limited time, making it less likely but not impossible. (4) Mid‑June tax receipts tend to reduce net borrowing needs, slightly dampening the short‑term increase unless Treasury aggressively rebuilds the TGA. Putting this together: P(Congress resolves before June 27) I estimate at roughly 10–20%, given historical patterns to act near the X‑date; conditional on resolution by then, P(TPDO ≥ $37T on June 27) perhaps ~40–60% depending on timing. That implies an overall probability in the mid‑single digits. I’m revising up modestly from 3% to reflect the corrected smaller gap to $37T and the historical size of catch‑up jumps, but I still weight a pre‑June‑27 resolution as unlikely.",
