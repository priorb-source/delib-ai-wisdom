  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days until July 1, 2025. There is likely one more FOMC meeting scheduled in June 2025 before the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve is maintaining its current interest rate stance with no cuts currently scheduled or announced before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its patient 'wait-and-see' approach as inflation remains elevated at 2.7% and the labor market stays resilient. At the June FOMC meeting, officials decide to hold rates steady, maintaining their cautious stance until they see more consistent progress on inflation. The first rate cut is announced at the July FOMC meeting or later, after the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either: (1) A significant economic shock occurs - such as financial market turmoil, banking stress, or sharp economic deterioration - prompting an emergency rate cut before July 1, or (2) Inflation data in May-June shows unexpectedly rapid improvement and labor market weakening, leading the Fed to announce a rate cut at the June FOMC meeting that takes effect before or is announced before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors the status quo of no rate cut before July 1. Fed Chair Powell explicitly stated the Fed is 'not in a hurry' to cut rates, and multiple Fed officials have emphasized patience. All major financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley) have recently pushed back their rate cut forecasts to July or later, with Goldman expecting December. The March Fed projections showed inflation at 2.7% with only two cuts anticipated for all of 2025, without specifying early timing. Current economic conditions don't support urgency: unemployment remains low at 4.2%, and inflation is still above target. Market indicators like CME FedWatch show low probability for June cuts, with September or later viewed as more likely. There is one FOMC meeting likely scheduled in June before the July 1 deadline, but given the Fed's current messaging and economic conditions, an announcement at that meeting seems unlikely. For the probability to be higher, we would need to see either a dramatic deterioration in economic conditions or a complete reversal in Fed communication within the next 48 days - both unlikely given the Fed's preference for gradual, well-telegraphed policy changes. For the probability to be lower, we would need absolute certainty that no economic shock could occur - but unforeseen events do happen, and there remains some time for conditions to change. The Fed has shown historically that it can act quickly in crisis situations, though such scenarios are rare. My forecast balances the strong status quo bias (which suggests very low probability) against the residual uncertainty from one remaining FOMC meeting and potential unforeseen economic developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement.
