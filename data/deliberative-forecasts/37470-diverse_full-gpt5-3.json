    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the high-level meeting, praise from the ITKF President, Egypt’s hosting capacity, and lack of visible competitors. Those are legitimate positives, but their claim that an announcement in the next two months would align with a 24–36 month cadence is backwards—24–36 months out would have been 2023–2024, so we’re already late relative to that pattern. Their 70% seems to underweight bureaucratic and timing frictions and the lack of any ITKF signaling. Forecaster 3’s reasoning is closer to my prior: positive momentum and capacity vs. compressed timeline, bureaucratic steps, and silence on official channels. I find Forecaster 3’s emphasis on process and timing constraints convincing. Neither added concrete evidence of an imminent ITKF meeting or congress before July 1, which would be the strongest near-term catalyst. One additional consideration not emphasized: Egypt hosting the WKF Senior Worlds in Nov 2025 could cut either way; it shows capacity but cross-federation dynamics may not be purely complementary, slightly tempering odds.",
    "rationale": "My base was 30% due to short time left, lack of official ITKF signals, and typical host selection processes clustering around congresses that may be scheduled later in the year. I’m nudging up slightly to 35% acknowledging the coherent case both forecasters make: strong political will, proven hosting track record, and no publicly known competitors raise the chance of a quick greenlight. However, I remain below Forecaster 3’s 42% because key catalysts (scheduled ITKF board/congress meetings, bid documentation, shortlist/recommendation leaks, or formal timelines) are still absent, and we’re already late vs. the federation’s historical announcement window. The status quo is no announcement and inertia is powerful. Upside triggers before July 1 would include any ITKF communication of a June vote/meeting or Egyptian officials signaling imminent confirmation; downside would be continued silence into late June or signs that host selection is slated for a later congress.",
