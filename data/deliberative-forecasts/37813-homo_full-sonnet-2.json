    "review": "All three of us converged on very similar forecasts (60-65%), using nearly identical reasoning - particularly emphasizing December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings as the key data point and the low bar of needing only one sighting. Forecaster 3 made a useful seasonal argument about increased outdoor activity in June potentially boosting sightings, though this is a modest factor. The most important shared recognition is the tension between 'rare in NUFORC history' suggesting many months have zero cube sightings, versus December's recent evidence of 6 sightings showing they do occur. None of the forecasters presented fundamentally new evidence or arguments that substantially change the analysis. The 5-percentage-point spread (60-65%) represents reasonable disagreement given our limited data - essentially one strong data point from five months ago with no information about January-May 2025 patterns.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm maintaining my 65% forecast. The key factors remain: (1) December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings provide concrete recent evidence these reports occur, (2) we only need ONE sighting in a 30-day period, not six, (3) 'rare' suggests low frequency but not impossibility, and (4) NUFORC continues operating normally with hundreds of monthly reports. The seasonal outdoor activity argument from Forecaster 3 provides modest additional support. The main uncertainty is whether December was 2x, 3x, or 5x above the typical rate for cube sightings. If December was moderately above average (2x), and typical months with cube sightings have 2-3 reports, then several months per year likely have at least one. If December was a major outlier (5x) and typical months have 0-1, then most months have zero. Without data from January-May 2025, I'm splitting the difference. The convergence of all three forecasters at 60-65% increases my confidence that this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. I'm not moving to 60% because the 'only need one' factor and December's recency (5 months ago) still feel slightly more indicative of Yes than No.",
