  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days remain, as the question resolves based on any single day from May 26, 2025 through June 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Tariffs continue to appear on front pages of at least one newspaper every day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain prominently featured in news coverage as ongoing EU negotiations continue ahead of the July 9 deadline, the 90-day pause on certain tariffs expires, and economic impacts generate continued reporting. The word 'tariff' appears on at least one of the two front pages every single day through June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, significant domestic incident) dominates both newspapers' front pages on the same day, or tariff negotiations enter a brief quiet period coinciding with a slower news cycle, causing both papers to independently focus their front pages on other topics for at least one day.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates tariffs are currently a major, active news story with multiple ongoing developments. Key factors maintaining prominence include: Trump's recent postponement of EU tariffs to July 9 (just after the resolution window), approaching expiration of a 90-day pause on trade levies, active negotiations with the EU and Vietnam, reported economic impacts ($830 per household cost, GDP reduction), and continued political commentary.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors continued front-page coverage. However, the question's structure creates a realistic path to YES: it only requires ONE day out of approximately 35 where BOTH papers simultaneously avoid mentioning tariffs. This is a high bar but not impossible.\n\nFactors supporting NO (15-20%): The issue remains central to Trump's policy agenda, multiple deadlines fall within or near the resolution period, negotiations are active, and economic effects are ongoing. Both papers covering such a prominent story differently on the same day is unlikely.\n\nFactors supporting YES (20%): 35 days provides multiple opportunities, news cycles are inherently unpredictable, major breaking events can dominate coverage, and weekend/holiday editions sometimes have lighter political focus. The requirement is only one day, not sustained absence.\n\nI'm not higher because tariffs are too prominent with too many active storylines and imminent deadlines. The dual-paper requirement is demanding. I'm not lower because 35 days offers enough opportunities for news cycle variation, and unpredictable events could temporarily shift focus. A forecast around 20% appropriately weights the strong status quo while acknowledging the realistic possibility of one aberrant day.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
