  "information": "Several international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently no agreement has been announced between Lebanon and the IMF",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite high-level political commitment and ongoing negotiations, Lebanon fails to complete necessary banking sector reforms or resolve technical sticking points with the IMF by the July 1 deadline. Negotiations continue beyond the deadline without a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon accelerates reforms ahead of the scheduled June 10 donor meeting, demonstrates sufficient progress on banking sector restructuring, and concludes negotiations with the IMF. An agreement is formally announced in mid-to-late June, unlocking the conditional EU aid package and other international support.",
    "rationale": "The baseline status quo favors No, as no agreement currently exists. However, several factors create upward pressure on probability: (1) President Aoun's public commitment to reach an IMF deal before summer 2025 signals high-level political will, (2) the EU's 500 million euro conditional aid provides strong external incentive, (3) the finance minister's expressed confidence suggests active progress, and (4) the June 10 donor meeting creates a natural focal point for announcements. Against this, Lebanon has a troubled history with IMF negotiations - previous agreements were reached but never implemented due to political gridlock and resistance to banking sector reforms. The 32-day timeframe is extremely tight for finalizing what are typically complex, multi-month negotiations involving detailed technical requirements. The banking sector restructuring requirement remains politically fraught given the power of Lebanon's banking elite. My forecast is not higher because of Lebanon's poor track record and the compressed timeline. It's not lower because of the unprecedented alignment of political commitment, external pressure, and scheduled events that could catalyze a breakthrough. I would update upward if concrete reform legislation passes before June 10 or if IMF officials publicly signal imminent agreement. I would update downward if the June 10 meeting produces no substantive announcements or if domestic political opposition to reforms intensifies.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
