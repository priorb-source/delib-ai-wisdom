    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, Circle is not publicly traded; without further action, shares will not be trading on the NYSE by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SEC comments and the need to include/refresh Q1 2025 financials prolong the review cycle; market volatility or a crypto drawdown leads Circle and underwriters to postpone to later in 2025; or any unexpected regulatory snag emerges. Any of these push the listing beyond July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle updates its S-1 with recent financials, receives SEC effectiveness in June, launches a brief roadshow, prices the IPO in late June, and begins trading on the NYSE before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: There are roughly 7 weeks left. That is enough for a late-stage IPO candidate to finalize SEC comments, update financials, run a 5–7 business day roadshow, price, and list. Many IPOs follow that cadence once they are near readiness.\n- Evidence and signals: Public commentary in early April 2025 (e.g., the Forbes article provided) suggests Circle’s IPO is actively in motion this year, consistent with earlier reporting that Circle pursued an IPO after a prior SPAC attempt fell through. This points to an advanced process rather than an early-stage exploration. Circle’s business has tailwinds from interest income on USDC reserves, supporting investor appetite.\n- Venue constraint: The resolution requires an NYSE listing. If Circle were to choose NASDAQ instead, this would resolve No even if they list. However, reporting around the IPO has indicated NYSE as the intended venue, reducing (but not eliminating) venue risk.\n- Base rates and risks: For companies that have publicly filed and are targeting a near-term window, completing within 1–2 months is common if markets are cooperative. Risks include: SEC comment timing, the need to incorporate Q1 numbers and refile, crypto market volatility, or a sudden risk-off in equities that causes a postponement. Crypto-related regulatory surprises add some incremental risk.\n- Status-quo weighting: The current state is “not listed,” which biases toward No absent further milestones. However, given the apparent maturity of the process and a still-open IPO window, the balance of probabilities is slightly in favor of a June listing.\n- Why not higher: The timeline buffer is thin; any modest SEC delay, market wobble, or internal decision to wait for a more favorable window could push this into July or later. Crypto-sector headline risk also argues against a very high probability.\n- Why not lower: Multiple public signals point to 2025 timing with plausible NYSE plans, and a June pricing/listing fits a standard IPO timeline from spring filings to summer execution.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation that Circle has launched its roadshow; an updated S-1 with a set price range; SEC declaring the registration effective; an NYSE ticker assignment and listing date guidance.\n- What would move me down: Reports of a postponement, extended SEC comments, adverse regulatory news, a sharp crypto/equities selloff, or indications of a venue change away from the NYSE.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided beyond the Forbes link; my estimate relies on general IPO process norms, known history of Circle’s listing attempts, and plausible timelines suggested by the April coverage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
