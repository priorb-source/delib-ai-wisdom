    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (until Metaculus checks MLB standings on or after 2025-06-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — another team likely edges the Dodgers in win percentage right now, so if standings stayed as-is this would resolve No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or two other elite teams (e.g., an AL East or NL East leader) maintain a .640–.670 pace while the Dodgers play merely solid baseball (.550–.600) over the next 3–4 weeks, leaving LA a game or two back in win percentage when the standings are checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers post a strong stretch (say 14–8 or better) while current leaders regress toward .500 for a couple of weeks, or LA and the top rival end up tied for the best win percentage on June 15 (which should count as having the highest).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: By mid-May, the Dodgers are almost always among the top few MLB teams by win percentage, but there are usually 2–4 peers within a couple of games. Over a short horizon (~25 days, ~22–25 games), order at the top can shuffle, but big swings are uncommon. That argues for giving extra weight to the status quo: if another team is slightly ahead today, No is the default, with meaningful but not dominant chances for LA to pass them.\nTalent and variance: The Dodgers’ true-talent win rate is plausibly around .600–.620, but several contenders (Yankees/Phillies/Orioles/Braves/Guardians, etc.) are in that band. Over ~24 games, a .600 team’s win total has a standard deviation around 2.4 wins, so making up or losing 1–2 games is quite plausible. If LA trails by about a game today, a rough probability to catch or tie the leader by mid-June is on the order of one-third to one-half; if they trail by 2–3 games, that drops to the 15–30% range. Without a precise current snapshot, a moderate, status-quo-weighted estimate is appropriate.\nResolution details: The question resolves off MLB’s official standings on or after June 15. Ties for the best winning percentage should count as “having the highest,” which slightly boosts the Yes probability relative to needing sole possession.\nWhy not higher: Multiple top teams can finish June 15 within a game; LA does not need to slump much to be edged out. Injuries and rotation management over a short window can shave a couple of wins. Schedule luck and one-run variance can break against them.\nWhy not lower: The Dodgers are an elite, deep roster and are very likely to remain top-tier over the next month; the short horizon leaves room to overtake a slim leader or to remain on top if they’re already close. A tie also likely counts as Yes.\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that LA currently holds the best (or tied-best) win percentage, or that their upcoming schedule is materially softer than that of their closest rivals; strong health/return news for key starters; widening run-differential edge suggesting sustainable dominance.\nWhat would move me down: A current snapshot showing them 2–3+ games back in win percentage; injuries to core stars or top starters; confirmation that multiple rivals have soft upcoming schedules or are materially outperforming LA by underlying metrics.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information provided, so the estimate leans on base rates, typical early-season variance, and the Dodgers’ consistent true-talent profile.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
