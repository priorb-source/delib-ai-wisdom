    "review": "My colleagues' analyses are well-reasoned based on the political and diplomatic incentives at play. Forecaster 2 (85%) and Forecaster 3 (75%) correctly identify the strong bilateral relationship with Brazil, the political alignment between Presidents Orsi and Lula, and the significant diplomatic cost of refusing the invitation. Their arguments powerfully illustrate the immense political pressure on Uruguay to accept. However, their analyses are critically flawed by the omission of the single most important piece of information provided in the initial research report: President Orsi's confirmed attendance at a UN conference in Seville, Spain, from June 30 to July 3, 2025. This creates a direct and highly problematic scheduling conflict. Their high probabilities are a logical conclusion from an incomplete set of premises; had they factored in this logistical barrier, their forecasts would undoubtedly be much lower.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward, though I remain highly skeptical of a 'Yes' outcome. My initial forecast of 10% was anchored almost exclusively on the logistical impossibility created by the President's confirmed travel to Spain overlapping with the resolution deadline. The analysis from the other forecasters has convinced me that I underestimated the sheer weight of the political pressure from Brazil. They correctly argue that for a new leftist government in Uruguay, publicly snubbing a personal invitation from President Lula would be a major diplomatic misstep with lasting consequences. This pressure might be sufficient to compel the Uruguayan government to make a purely political announcement confirming attendance before the July 1st deadline, even if they know the President cannot realistically attend. The resolution hinges only on the announcement, not the attendance itself. Therefore, a scenario where Uruguay says 'yes' to appease Brazil and deals with the logistical fallout later is more plausible than I first assessed. I am raising my forecast from 10% to 25%. This adjustment reflects the significant political drivers for a 'Yes' outcome, while still maintaining that the logistical conflict makes 'No' the far more probable outcome. A 75% chance of 'No' reflects the high likelihood that the government will act on the logistical reality and avoid making a knowingly problematic announcement.",
