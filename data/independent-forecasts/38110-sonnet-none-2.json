    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 1 month until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The border closure continues through June due to unresolved security concerns about the Mahmuda terror group and arms smuggling. Diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria proceed slowly, with both countries maintaining firm positions. Security assessments determine that the threat level remains too high for immediate reopening, and no agreement on border security protocols is reached within the one-month timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "High-level diplomatic intervention occurs quickly, possibly with ECOWAS mediation. Both governments rapidly implement border security measures and monitoring systems to address the terrorism and smuggling concerns. Economic pressure from traders and business communities, combined with political will from both capitals, leads to a negotiated reopening with enhanced security protocols in place before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo (borders remaining closed) for several compelling reasons. First, the closure is extremely recent - occurring just in May 2025, meaning it's only days or weeks old. Border closures involving serious security concerns (terrorism, arms smuggling) typically require substantial time to resolve. Second, the nature of the issues is grave: the Mahmuda terror group attacks and arms smuggling are not trivial matters that governments can quickly dismiss. Historical precedent supports a lengthy closure - Nigeria's previous border closure with Benin in 2019 over smuggling lasted over a year (August 2019-December 2020). Third, the timeframe is remarkably short at just one month. Complex diplomatic negotiations, security assessments, and implementation of new protocols rarely happen this quickly. Fourth, my research assistant found no additional information suggesting active negotiations or imminent reopening plans, which would be expected if resolution were near. The absence of such reporting is significant. However, I'm not forecasting lower because diplomatic situations can occasionally produce rapid results, particularly under economic pressure or regional (ECOWAS) intervention. Additionally, one month does provide technical time for high-level political intervention if both governments prioritize it. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: active bilateral negotiations, ECOWAS mediation efforts, mounting economic pressure forcing action, or security improvements being implemented. For it to move lower, I would need: deterioration of security conditions, hardening positions from either government, or additional border incidents.",
