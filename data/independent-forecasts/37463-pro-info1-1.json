  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing is due around May 15, 2025. As today is May 8, 2025, the outcome will be known in approximately one week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million Amazon shares as of its last filing. If the company made no changes to this position, its holding would remain above the 10,000,000 share threshold, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway sells at least 700,000 shares of Amazon during Q1 2025, bringing its total holdings to 10,000,000 shares or fewer. This action would align with their recent trend of being net sellers of equities to increase their cash reserves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon holdings are reported as greater than 10,000,000 shares. This would occur if the company either maintained its existing position, sold fewer than 700,000 shares, or purchased additional shares during the quarter.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the principle of inertia and the specific resolution criteria. The question resolves 'Yes' if Berkshire's Amazon holdings in the Q1 2025 13F filing are above 10,000,000 shares. According to the research, their position as of the prior quarter (Q4 2024) was approximately 10.7 million shares, which is already above the threshold. Therefore, the status quo outcome is 'Yes', and this forms a strong baseline for the forecast. The path of least resistance for any large portfolio holding is to remain unchanged.\n\nHowever, the forecast is not higher due to strong counter-evidence provided by the research assistant. Berkshire has been a net seller of equities for 10 consecutive quarters and increased its cash reserves to a record high in Q1 2025. This indicates a broad strategy of reducing equity exposure and preserving capital, making it plausible that they trimmed various positions, including Amazon. A sale of 700,000 shares (a ~6.5% reduction) to fall below the threshold is a distinct possibility within this strategic context.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because while the general trend is selling, it does not guarantee the sale of this specific stock in this specific quarter. A 'No' outcome requires a specific action (selling at least 700,000 shares), whereas a 'Yes' outcome can result from simple inaction. Without a specific catalyst or negative commentary on Amazon from Berkshire's leadership, holding the position steady remains the most probable single outcome.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if new information suggested a shift in Berkshire's strategy away from cash accumulation. I would decrease my probability if there were reports of Berkshire liquidating other major tech holdings during Q1, which would suggest a portfolio-wide trimming that likely included Amazon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion.

New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
