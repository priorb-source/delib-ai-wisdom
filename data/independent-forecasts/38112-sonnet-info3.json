  "information": "The admission of new full members to BRICS requires the unanimous consent of all existing members. An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué. Ahead of the July summit, the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum is scheduled for June 3-5 in Brasília to discuss topics including sustainable development, climate action, and multilateral governance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days. The 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, with resolution at 00:00 on July 8, 2025 (Rio de Janeiro time). Today is May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new country is invited to BRICS as a full member at or before the 17th Summit, resolving the question as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite interest from multiple countries, existing BRICS members fail to reach unanimous agreement on inviting any new full members at the July summit. Internal divisions persist, and the bloc continues with its current 10 members while potentially maintaining the partner country framework as the preferred expansion path.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BRICS members overcome recent disagreements and reach unanimous consensus to invite at least one country to full membership. This could be one of the 13 partner countries invited in October 2024 (such as Malaysia, Thailand, or Nigeria) or another country. Brazil as host successfully brokers agreement among all members.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor the status quo of no new invitation. Most critically, the April 2025 foreign ministers' meeting failed to produce a joint communiqué, indicating significant internal divisions among the now 10 members. Achieving unanimous consent for new members is inherently more difficult with expanded membership.\n\nThe October 2024 summit's introduction of a partner country framework suggests BRICS has shifted to a more gradualist expansion approach. Rather than direct invitations to full membership, they're using a tiered system. This framework appears to be the current preferred path, with 13 countries invited as partners.\n\nThe timeline is also challenging—only 5-6 weeks remain until the summit with no confirmed plans or strong signals about specific invitations. While many countries have expressed interest, there's no evidence of concrete proposals nearing unanimous approval.\n\nHowever, several factors prevent a lower probability: BRICS has demonstrated willingness to expand (2023's major expansion), expansion remains a stated organizational goal, and there are numerous interested countries including established partners. Brazil as host may push for expansion, and pre-summit meetings (like the June 3-5 Parliamentary Forum) could facilitate consensus-building. Indonesia's elevation to full membership in January 2025 shows the pathway exists.\n\nThe recent discord at the April meeting is particularly significant—if members cannot agree on a communiqué, agreeing on new members seems substantially less likely. The partner framework appears designed specifically to manage expansion pressures without requiring the difficult unanimous consent for full membership.\n\nFor me to update higher, I would need: clear pre-summit announcements of planned invitations, successful consensus-building meetings in June, or strong public commitments from multiple members. For me to update lower: explicit statements ruling out new invitations, continued public disagreements, or confirmation that the partner framework will be the exclusive focus.\n\nGiven the strong recent evidence of internal divisions, the gradualist turn in expansion strategy, and the short remaining timeline without clear signals, I assign a low probability while acknowledging non-trivial uncertainty.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe admission of new full members to BRICS requires the unanimous consent of all existing members. An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
