  "information": "Historically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between June 10 and June 30, 2025, passes without any of the 705 MEPs announcing their resignation. Any MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal may choose to fight the allegations rather than step down, and no other MEPs resign for unrelated reasons like health or taking up a national government post during this specific 21-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one Member of the European Parliament announces their resignation between June 10 and June 30, 2025. This could be a direct result of the Huawei lobbying scandal, with an implicated MEP resigning due to pressure from their political group. Alternatively, an unrelated resignation could occur, for instance, an MEP leaving to take a position in their national government following a cabinet reshuffle.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two key factors: the historical base rate of resignations and the potential impact of the recent Huawei scandal. \n\nFirst, the base rate. According to my research, the European Parliament typically sees 80-120 replacements per five-year term, which averages to 1.3 to 2 resignations per month. The resolution window for this question is 21 days (June 10 to June 30), or about 70% of a month. Applying this to the historical average suggests a baseline expectation of approximately 1 to 1.4 resignations during this period for any reason (health, new appointments, etc.). The statistical probability of at least one event occurring given this average rate is already well over 60%.\n\nSecond, the recent Huawei lobbying scandal acts as a significant catalyst. While precedents from past scandals are mixed—with some MEPs resigning quickly and others resisting for months—a major scandal undoubtedly increases the short-term probability of a resignation above the historical baseline. This pressure is compounded by the fact that turnover is often higher in the first year of a new parliamentary term, which we are currently in.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 75 because the resolution window is very narrow. Political and legal processes following a scandal can be slow, and MEPs have strong incentives to retain their seats. It is plausible that any scandal-related resignations could occur after this window closes in July or August. The mixed precedent of 'Qatargate' shows that resignation is not an automatic or immediate outcome. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 75 because the high baseline rate of resignations for mundane reasons creates a strong floor for this forecast. The addition of a specific, high-profile scandal makes the chance of zero resignations across the entire parliament for a 21-day period significantly less likely. \n\nI would increase my forecast if a major political group in the Parliament formally called for an implicated member's resignation. I would decrease it if the key figures at the center of the scandal received strong public backing from their party leadership, indicating a strategy to ride out the storm.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
