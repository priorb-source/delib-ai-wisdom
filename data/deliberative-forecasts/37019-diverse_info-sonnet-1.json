    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new evidence I hadn't considered: Stapleton has 19 prior ACM awards and just won 4 CMA Awards in 2024 plus 1 Grammy in 2025 for the same body of work being judged here. This momentum is highly significant - if the same material is winning across multiple awarding bodies, it suggests strong resonance with voters. Forecaster 3 adds valuable competitive context, noting Ella Langley leads with 8 nominations, while Cody Johnson and Morgan Wallen have 7 each. This is stronger competition than I initially assessed. However, Forecaster 3's forecast (77%) aligns closely with mine, suggesting we weighted factors similarly. The tension is between Forecaster 2's emphasis on momentum/track record (90%) versus Forecaster 3's and my emphasis on competitive uncertainty (77-78%).",
    "rationale": "The most compelling new evidence is Stapleton's recent award momentum. Winning 4 CMA Awards and 1 Grammy for the same body of work being considered at the ACMs is a strong signal that this material is resonating with industry voters across multiple institutions. Combined with his 19 prior ACM wins, this establishes him not just as a perennial nominee but as a consistent ACM winner specifically. However, I'm not fully convinced by Forecaster 2's 90% forecast. While the momentum is real, the competitive landscape is notably strong this year - three artists have more nominations than Stapleton, and ACM Awards sometimes spread recognition across multiple artists rather than concentrating wins. The difference between 5-6 nominations (the discrepancy in our counts) doesn't materially change the analysis. My base case remains that with 5 separate opportunities and strong momentum, a complete shutout is improbable. The new momentum evidence pushes me upward from 78%, but not to 90%. The strong competition and awards unpredictability keep me from going higher than the low-to-mid 80s range.",
