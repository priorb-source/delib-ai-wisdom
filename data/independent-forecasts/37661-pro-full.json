  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one and a half months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, Starlink's availability map does not show Bangladesh as 'Available'. If the final regulatory and commercial steps are not completed, this status will remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The review and approval of Starlink's tariff plan by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) takes longer than the remaining six weeks. Additionally, political pressure from the US investigation into the deal could cause either SpaceX or the Bangladeshi government to pause the final rollout to mitigate political risk, pushing the commercial launch past the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the strong political will from the Bangladeshi government, Starlink's submitted tariff plan is fast-tracked and approved by the BTRC in late May or early June. With no need to wait for local ground stations due to its laser-linked satellite constellation, SpaceX quickly proceeds with the commercial launch and updates its availability map to 'Available' for Bangladesh before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant positive momentum for a rapid launch, countered by remaining bureaucratic and political risks. The primary drivers for a 'Yes' outcome are the high-level political support in Bangladesh, evidenced by the leader's final approval, and the swift granting of licenses by the BTRC on April 30, 2025. Furthermore, the technical path is clear; SpaceX can service Bangladesh with its existing satellite constellation without depending on the construction of local gateways, which is a common source of delay. The stated target of a May 2025 launch, while optimistic, underscores the intent for a speedy rollout.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher than 75% due to two key uncertainties. First, Starlink must still submit a tariff plan for regulatory approval. While a fast-track seems likely given the political climate, any unexpected complexities or delays in this bureaucratic process could easily consume the short time remaining until the deadline. Second, the call for a US federal investigation in mid-May introduces a significant political wildcard. This could cause SpaceX or its partners to proceed more cautiously, potentially delaying the final steps to avoid further controversy. The typical rollout time after licensing varies widely, and while conditions in Bangladesh point towards the faster end of the spectrum, a delay of even a few weeks would result in a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 75% because the concrete actions taken—granting of licenses, a successful trial, and high-level political announcements—outweigh the more speculative risks. The momentum from the Bangladeshi side appears strong enough to push through the final domestic regulatory hurdle, and the US political issue may not have a material impact on the operational timeline within the next 45 days.\n\nI would increase my probability upon news that the tariff plan has been approved by the BTRC. I would decrease my probability if there are reports of delays in the tariff review or if either SpaceX or the Bangladeshi government issues statements indicating a pause in response to the US investigation.",
