    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my baseline: long, capacity‑constrained legislative process; no bill on the TNLA order paper; competing crises and fiscal shock; plus the additional step of depositing the instrument. They also acknowledge modest tailwinds (regional momentum, domestic advocacy, ability to fast‑track if prioritized). Forecaster 2 adds a useful budgetary angle (no AfCFTA‑related allocations) as a signal of lower short‑term readiness, and both emphasize the practical lag between passage and AU deposit. I didn’t see new concrete evidence (e.g., a bill tabled) or a materially different mechanism that would accelerate timelines beyond what I had considered.",
    "rationale": "My prior reasoning emphasized the same bottlenecks: short window (~60 days), infrequent TNLA sittings, crowded agenda, and the nontrivial deposit step. I also allowed for a non‑trivial upside if the presidency orders a fast‑track and treats ratification as a low‑cost, symbolic win with implementation later. The other analyses reinforce, rather than alter, those priors. The added point about lack of budget allocations marginally supports a lower probability, but given that ratification can be decoupled from near‑term fiscal implementation, I don’t weight it enough to move meaningfully. With no fresh signs of a bill, cabinet action, or scheduling, I maintain a low but non‑zero chance. Triggers that would move me up: cabinet approval and gazetting of a ratification bill, TNLA readings/committee reports, or credible reports that the instrument is being prepared for deposit; down: TNLA adjournment without tabling by early/mid‑June or new political disruptions. Keeping my forecast unchanged.",
