    "review": "The other forecasters raised a critical point I completely overlooked: the Easter calendar effect. Forecaster 2 correctly identified that Easter fell on March 31 in 2024 but April 20 in 2025. This means the Easter holiday period and associated school breaks largely fell in March 2024 but April 2025, which would mechanically shift substantial tourism volumes from March to April year-over-year. This is a major structural factor strongly favoring higher April 2025 numbers. Both forecasters also emphasized that we're at April 30, meaning the month has concluded and any disruptions would be known - yet my research assistant provided no such information. Their analyses align closely with mine on the fundamentals: 2.2% February growth, European-dominated market, limited US tourist impact, and lack of disruption evidence. However, the Easter timing is a game-changing consideration I failed to account for.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the Easter calendar effect is the most significant factor in this forecast. When Easter shifts from March to April year-over-year, it creates a powerful mechanical boost to April tourism numbers, as families plan vacations around school holidays and the Easter break. Combined with the established growth trend (2.2% in February), European market dominance making US tariff concerns marginal, and the absence of reported disruptions despite April having concluded, the probability of a decline should be lower than my initial assessment. The burden of proof for a decline requires evidence of a shock large enough to overcome both the positive baseline trend AND the favorable Easter calendar positioning. No such evidence has emerged. I am updating my forecast downward from 27% to 23%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 2's well-reasoned 22% estimate that properly incorporated the Easter effect.",
