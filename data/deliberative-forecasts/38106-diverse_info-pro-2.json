    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus that a visit is highly unlikely, with forecasts ranging from 3-6%. All three of us identify the key constraints: the extremely short timeframe, the immense logistical and political barriers, and the complete absence of the usual diplomatic groundwork. Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 both introduced valuable new information I had not considered. Forecaster 2's point about the upcoming June 2 Istanbul talks, and specifically that the U.S. is not sending an official delegation, is a powerful piece of evidence that makes a presidential visit even less likely. This new fact makes me question their 6% forecast, as it seems to contradict a higher probability. Forecaster 3 provided an excellent structural analysis, noting the historical precedent (no visit in Trump's first term), a potential mechanism for a visit (the SPIEF in early June), and the counter-signal of exchanged invitations from February. Their reasoning aligns very closely with my own and reinforces my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 3%. My initial reasoning, based on the recent hostile rhetoric and the severe time constraint, has been significantly strengthened by new information from the other forecasters. The fact that the U.S. is not sending an official delegation to the June 2 Istanbul talks, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, is a very strong signal that high-level diplomatic engagement is not on the immediate horizon. It would be an almost unprecedented leap to go from no delegation at a peace talk to a full presidential visit in the same month. While Forecaster 3 rightly notes the prior exchange of invitations and the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) as a potential 'hook', these factors are weak. The invitations from February are likely superseded by the extremely negative rhetoric in late May. A visit for SPIEF would be politically toxic for Trump, especially during an active conflict. Therefore, the new information reinforces the structural barriers against a visit more than it provides plausible pathways for one. Trump's well-established unpredictability is the only factor keeping the probability from being near-zero, and 3% adequately captures this small but non-trivial tail risk.",
