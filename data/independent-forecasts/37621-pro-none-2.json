    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a late-May owners' meeting, a revised proposal to ban or restrict the 'Tush-Push' is presented and gains the necessary 24 votes for approval due to a last-minute push from a powerful coalition of owners concerned about competitive balance or player safety.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the extremely short timeframe. Today is May 12, 2025, and the deadline is less than three weeks away on June 1. The primary period for NFL rule changes is during the Annual League Meeting, which occurs in March. Since the play was not banned then, it is highly improbable that the league would convene a special meeting and pass a contentious rule change in this narrow window before the season preparations are well underway. The articles provided, while nearly a year old, indicate a divided ownership and a tabled vote, not a groundswell of support for an imminent ban. For a ban to have been likely, it would have been a major topic of discussion leading into and during the March 2025 meetings. The status quo, where the play is legal, is therefore the overwhelming default outcome. My probability is not lower than 5% because the play remains controversial, and there is a non-zero chance of a late league meeting where this could be addressed, however unlikely. My forecast is not higher because of the immense procedural and political inertia; passing a rule change like this outside the normal offseason schedule would be highly irregular. I would increase my forecast significantly if there were reports of a meeting being scheduled before June 1 with this rule on the agenda. I would decrease it if the NFL officially confirmed no more meetings were scheduled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
