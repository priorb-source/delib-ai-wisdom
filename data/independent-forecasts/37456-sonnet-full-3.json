  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued 40 days ago on March 28, 2025, giving a total window of approximately 94 days from recall issuance to the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active on July 1, 2025 and is not closed before that date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active past July 1, 2025 due to the complexity of tracking products across multiple states and foodservice channels, the large volume of recalled product (212,268 pounds), and challenges in verifying that all products with shelf lives extending into 2026 have been properly retrieved and disposed of. The multi-state distribution and institutional foodservice component make complete verification particularly time-consuming.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025 because it is classified as Class III (lowest risk), no illnesses were reported, and FSIS completes its verification process within the typical 90-day median timeframe for this recall class. The specific production dates and clear establishment number facilitate efficient tracking, and the 'abundance of caution' nature of the recall means less intensive follow-up is required.",
    "rationale": "The median closure time for Class III recalls is approximately 90 days according to the research assistant's report, and we have 94 days from the March 28 recall date to July 1, 2025. This puts the resolution date right at the median, which would ordinarily suggest roughly 50% probability. However, several complicating factors likely push this recall above the median timeframe: (1) large product volume of over 212,000 pounds, (2) multi-state distribution spanning at least 8 states, (3) foodservice channel distribution which is harder to track than retail, and (4) extremely long shelf life with some products good until March 2026, complicating verification. The assistant explicitly notes that recalls with these characteristics 'frequently take longer to resolve.' Against this, the Class III classification (lowest risk) typically allows for less intensive verification, and no adverse health effects have been reported. We are already 40 days into the recall period with no indication of closure yet, which slightly favors the status quo of remaining Active. Given status quo bias (recalls don't change status unless actively moved through the process) and the specific complicating factors for this recall that likely extend it beyond the median, I estimate approximately 45% probability of closure before July 1. This forecast would increase if I learned that product retrieval is proceeding faster than expected or that FSIS is expediting Class III recalls. It would decrease if I learned of specific difficulties in product tracking or if the long shelf life is proving particularly challenging for verification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
