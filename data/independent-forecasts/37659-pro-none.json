    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and the forecast date is May 16, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The administration continues its rapid implementation of Project 2025's objectives via executive action. This pace, established in the first few months, is sufficient to overcome some legal and bureaucratic friction, allowing the number of fully completed objectives to surpass the 120 threshold by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The implementation of the Project 2025 agenda is significantly slowed by widespread and successful legal challenges that result in federal court injunctions against key executive orders. Combined with bureaucratic resistance within agencies and the emergence of unforeseen crises that divert the administration's attention, the rate of objective completion falls, and the count remains below 120 by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging its extensive pre-inauguration planning, the administration successfully executes a blitz of policy changes through executive orders and agency directives. The chosen initial objectives are largely immune to or survive early legal challenges, allowing the tracker to register a rapid accumulation of 'Done' items, easily exceeding 120 within the first five and a half months of the term.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is predicated on the context of a new administration in office since January 20, 2025, actively implementing the Project 2025 agenda. The central tension is between the administration's unprecedented level of preparation and the inherent institutional friction of the U.S. government.\n\nThe threshold of 120 'Done' objectives represents approximately 5.6% of the 2,137 total objectives identified by the tracker. Achieving this in the first 162 days of an administration is ambitious, requiring an average completion rate of about 0.74 objectives per day.\n\nMy forecast leans towards 'Yes' primarily due to the nature of Project 2025 itself. It was designed to enable a rapid, centrally-controlled overhaul of the executive branch, targeting a large volume of 'low-hanging fruit' that can be addressed via executive order, memorandum, or changes in regulatory enforcement, bypassing the need for congressional action. A focused effort could plausibly achieve this rate of change early in the term.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because of the significant and predictable headwinds. Any controversial executive action is almost certain to face immediate legal challenges from interest groups and state attorneys general. A few unfavorable court rulings could place major initiatives on indefinite hold, preventing them from being classified as 'Done'. Furthermore, bureaucratic inertia and personnel confirmation delays are common obstacles that can slow even the most determined administrations. The definition of 'Done' as 'successfully implemented' by the tracker implies a high bar that an announcement or signed order might not immediately meet.\n\nThe forecast is not lower because underestimating the administration's ability to execute a pre-planned strategy would be a mistake. The sheer volume of objectives provides many avenues for scoring quick 'wins' on non-controversial or obscure administrative items that can accumulate rapidly.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards if, by mid-May 2025, the tracker already showed a high velocity of completions (e.g., >80) and major legal challenges were failing. I would update downwards if key executive orders were already tied up in court with injunctions or if the tracker showed a completion rate significantly below what is required.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
