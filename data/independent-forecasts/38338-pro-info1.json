  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on his past actions, the default scenario is that John Morgan will continue to publicly consider a run for governor but will ultimately decline to enter the race before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "John Morgan continues to evaluate the political landscape and the declared field of candidates. Consistent with his public statements and past behavior in the 2018 and 2022 election cycles, he concludes that the timing is not right or that he can be more effective through other means, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without him making a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "After observing the existing candidates, John Morgan perceives a clear opening for a populist, self-funded campaign. Believing he can capture a significant portion of the vote, he makes a formal announcement in late June, consistent with his stated preference for a brief, three-month campaign, leveraging his personal wealth and name recognition to immediately become a major contender.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by John Morgan's established pattern of behavior. He has publicly considered running for governor in at least two previous cycles (2018 and 2022) only to decide against it. This history forms a strong base rate suggesting that his current considerations are more likely to result in the same outcome. The status quo is that he is not a candidate, and this is the most probable future. The short timeline, with less than a month remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, further supports a 'No' resolution, as most major gubernatorial campaigns require more lead time for staffing and organization, even for a self-funded candidate.\n\nHowever, the probability is not close to zero. Morgan's ability to self-fund a campaign eliminates the need for a lengthy fundraising period, making a late entry more feasible. His recent public statements, as noted in Politico, confirm he is actively considering a run and has a specific campaign model in mind—a brief, three-month sprint. This keeps the possibility of a 'Yes' outcome open. My forecast is not lower because his financial resources and high name recognition make him a credible potential candidate who could decide to run on a compressed timeline if he perceives a unique political opportunity.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because his history of non-candidacy is the single most predictive data point available. Without new, concrete evidence of campaign preparations—such as hiring a campaign manager, filing exploratory paperwork, or booking major media buys—his words must be weighed against his past actions. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon receiving credible reports of concrete campaign activities. Conversely, I would decrease the probability as the deadline approaches without any such signals, or if he makes a statement ruling out a run.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
