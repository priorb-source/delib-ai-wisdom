    "review": "The other forecasters provided two crucial inputs that refine my analysis. Forecaster 3 introduced a powerful historical statistic: advance estimates between -0.5% and 0% flip to positive in the third estimate 35-40% of the time. This provides a strong quantitative anchor for this specific scenario. However, their analysis appears to be based only on the advance estimate and misses the second estimate's upward revision to -0.2%. Forecaster 2's reasoning was more compelling and directly relevant to the current situation. They made an excellent point that I had not fully weighted: the second estimate, which incorporates more complete March data, only produced a modest +0.1 percentage point revision. This suggests that the incoming data on trade and inventories may not be strong enough to produce the larger upward revision needed to turn the final reading positive, acting as a strong counterpoint to my initial optimism about a large swing.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the fact that a revision of +0.3 percentage points, while larger than the average second-to-third estimate revision, was plausible given the negative print was driven by volatile components like net exports. The other forecasters' analyses have caused me to refine this view slightly downward. While Forecaster 3's historical data showing a 35-40% flip rate for similar initial readings confirms that my initial forecast was in the correct range, Forecaster 2's argument about the second estimate is persuasive. The revision from -0.3% to -0.2% was positive, but its small magnitude suggests we are not seeing a major data surprise that would be needed to bridge the remaining gap to positive territory. The chance for a 'Yes' is still significant and supported by historical data, but the evidence from the second estimate tempers the odds. I am therefore reducing my forecast slightly to account for the underwhelming size of the second revision. I am moving from 40% to 38%, placing me near the high end of the historical range, reflecting the positive momentum of the last revision, but acknowledging the counter-evidence that this momentum might be fading.",
