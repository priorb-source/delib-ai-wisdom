    "review": "All three forecasters agree that the status quo is the most likely outcome, but we differ significantly on the probability. My initial forecast (3%) was primarily based on the high probability of a non-political 'black swan' health event. Forecaster 2 (8%) introduces a key piece of new information: Kadyrov's subsequent backtracking of his resignation statement. This is a powerful argument against a politically-driven departure and reinforces my initial skepticism. Forecaster 3 (27%) provides the most compelling case for a 'Yes' outcome by synthesizing three key factors: the public resignation talk, persistent health rumors, and visible succession planning (e.g., promotions for his children). This confluence of signals is a crucial point I had previously understated; it suggests the potential for a near-term exit is more real now than during his past statements. While I find Forecaster 3's 27% too high given the very short timeframe and Kadyrov's subsequent backtracking, their argument about the combination of risk factors is convincing enough to merit an update. Forecaster 2's reasoning, which acknowledges the backtracking while still seeing a slightly elevated risk, is the most persuasive overall.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast from 3% to 7%. My initial forecast was too low as it primarily discounted the resignation statement as political theater and only accounted for a minimal 'black swan' health risk. Forecaster 2's report of Kadyrov's May 12 backtrack reinforces my view that a politically-driven resignation in the next 20 days is extremely unlikely. However, Forecaster 3's analysis convinced me that I was underweighting the combination of factors at play. The conjunction of (1) the public statement itself, (2) credible, persistent reporting on serious health issues, and (3) concrete succession-planning moves (promoting his children) makes the current situation materially different and more volatile than previous instances. These factors increase the probability of a sudden departure, most likely due to a health crisis, beyond a baseline 'black swan' risk. My new forecast of 7% reflects a continued strong belief in the status quo, especially given the backtrack, but acknowledges a moderately elevated risk of an unexpected event forcing his exit before June 1, 2025.",
