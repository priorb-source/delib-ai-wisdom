    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS recall page remains marked Active on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks take longer than expected, the firm expands the recall or updates distribution lists, or FSIS website processing lags, leaving the status as Active on or after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes recall effectiveness checks, FSIS verifies and updates the recall status to Closed on the linked page sometime in May or June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: FSIS meat/poultry recalls commonly move from Active to Closed within roughly 1–3 months once effectiveness checks are complete. This recall was posted April 5, giving about 86 days until June 30. The scope (about 22,000 pounds) is moderate and the product is widely distributed but not massive in scale, which typically supports timely closure. Johnsonville is an experienced firm likely to execute quickly, and foreign-matter recalls (often Class II) are generally straightforward once implicated lots are accounted for and retail audits are done.\n\nStatus-quo pull: The page remains Active unless and until FSIS updates it; website update lag and any lingering verification steps bias toward remaining Active by default. Because the world changes slowly, I place extra weight on this inertia, which keeps the probability below very high levels.\n\nWhy not higher: Risks include a recall expansion, additional consumer reports, or extended effectiveness checks across many retailers, any of which could push closure past July 1. Also, FSIS page-update latency can delay the visible status change even if field work is done.\n\nWhy not lower: The elapsed time window (nearly three months by end of June) is usually sufficient for this type and size of recall. The product is not extremely long-shelf-life in commerce, and the company’s capability suggests efficient execution. Many similar recalls close within this timeframe.\n\nUpdate triggers: I would raise the probability if FSIS posts signs of wrap-up (e.g., no further updates for weeks, or language indicating effectiveness checks are complete), or if comparable Johnsonville recalls close within ~60–90 days. I would lower it if there’s a recall expansion, additional states/retailers added late, new injury reports, or ongoing frequent page updates implying work remains. The research assistant provided no additional info beyond the background link, so this forecast rests on general FSIS recall timing patterns and the known scope/timing of this event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
