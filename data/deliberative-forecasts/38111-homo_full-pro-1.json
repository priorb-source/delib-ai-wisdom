    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identify the upcoming UN conference in June as the central, action-forcing event. We all cite the French-led initiative (now including the UK), the specific Axios report about Malta's intentions, and the precedent set by the 2024 recognitions as the primary evidence supporting a 'Yes' outcome. Likewise, we all acknowledge the significant counter-pressure from the US and Israel, as well as the conditionality in President Macron's statements, as the main sources of uncertainty. The forecasts are tightly clustered at 80-85%, indicating a shared assessment of a high-probability event. Forecaster 2's framing of the situation as a 'powerful confluence' with 'multiple pathways to a Yes resolution' and Forecaster 3's description of the conference as an 'action-forcing mechanism' were particularly insightful and persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing my forecast slightly. Their reasoning reinforces my own but has convinced me that I was giving slightly too much weight to the countervailing pressures. I find Forecaster 2's argument about 'multiple pathways' particularly compelling. My initial 80% forecast might have under-appreciated the redundancy in the pro-recognition camp. For a 'No' outcome, not only would the reported Maltese plan have to fall through, but France would also have to delay, and no other country (e.g., Belgium, Luxembourg) would step forward despite the immense diplomatic focus. The combination of a very specific intelligence report (Axios on Malta) and a broad, high-level political push (the Franco-British initiative at the UN conference) makes it highly probable that at least one country will follow through. The conference itself acts as an 'action-forcing mechanism,' as Forecaster 3 aptly put it, making it politically costly for committed nations to back down at the last minute. Therefore, a 1-in-5 chance of failure (implied by an 80% forecast) now seems too high. I am updating my forecast to 85% to better reflect the robustness and redundancy of the current diplomatic momentum.",
