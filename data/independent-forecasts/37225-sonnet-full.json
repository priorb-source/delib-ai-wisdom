  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days until the May 25, 2025 election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins the most seats based on current polling",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Democratic Party (NDP) or another party closes the gap and wins more seats than the VHP, potentially driven by the extremely high public dissatisfaction (56% dissatisfied with government, Santokhi's 3% approval rating) translating into votes for opposition parties despite their fragmentation",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP maintains its polling lead of 29% versus NDP's 24%, benefiting from opposition fragmentation, recent economic improvements (inflation reduction from 60% to 10%, oil deals, salary increases), and the death of NDP's former leader Desi Bouterse which has weakened their main competitor",
    "rationale": "The most recent poll from April 22, 2025 shows VHP with a 5-point lead (29% vs 24%) just 27 days before the election. This represents a dramatic shift from January polling that showed NDP at 54%, likely explained by Bouterse's death and subsequent NDP disarray. The status quo based on current polling favors VHP winning the most seats. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The massive disconnect between Santokhi's 3% approval rating and VHP's 29% polling performance suggests either polling error or voters choosing VHP as the least-bad option despite dissatisfaction; (2) 66% believe the country is worse off than five years ago; (3) The new proportional representation system being used for the first time adds uncertainty. Factors supporting the forecast: Opposition fragmentation works in VHP's favor for winning a plurality; the election is only 27 days away, limiting time for major swings; VHP has delivered some tangible economic results despite dissatisfaction. The forecast is not higher because of the extreme dissatisfaction metrics and very low approval ratings which could manifest in unexpected ways. It's not lower because the recent polling advantage is clear, time is short, and opposition fragmentation is a structural advantage. I would update higher if new polls confirm or expand VHP's lead, or lower if polls show rapid NDP consolidation or if the dissatisfaction metrics begin translating into clearer opposition momentum.",
