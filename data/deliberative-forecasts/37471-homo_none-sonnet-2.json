    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling points I should weigh carefully. First, they correctly note the math: reaching 550k from 500k requires approximately 16.7k units per month, not my initial estimate of 14k - making the target somewhat more challenging. Second, both emphasize builder behavior moderation at extreme inventory levels, which is a real market constraint. Third, Forecaster 2's invocation of status quo bias is well-reasoned - markets at extremes tend to stabilize rather than accelerate further. Fourth, Forecaster 3's point about sales absorption preventing unlimited accumulation is valid, even in weak demand environments. However, I notice they may be underweighting two factors: (1) The construction pipeline effect - homes under construction will complete and add to inventory regardless of builder pullback on new starts, creating momentum; (2) The persistent high-rate environment continues suppressing demand, which mechanically adds to inventory. Both forecasters acknowledge these but seem to weight mean reversion and builder response more heavily.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward but not to their levels. The corrected calculation (16.7k/month vs my 14k) makes the threshold moderately harder to reach. The emphasis on market stabilization at extremes and builder behavior moderation are well-founded concerns. However, I maintain that the construction pipeline creates near-term momentum that's somewhat independent of builder sentiment - projects started months ago will complete. Additionally, the high-rate environment isn't resolving quickly, continuing to suppress demand absorption. The other forecasters appropriately weight mean reversion forces, but the 3-month timeframe is short enough that pipeline effects could dominate behavioral responses. I'm updating from 38% to 33% - acknowledging their valid critiques about the aggressive growth rate needed and market dynamics at extremes, while maintaining that pipeline momentum and persistent demand weakness create meaningful probability of hitting this threshold.",
