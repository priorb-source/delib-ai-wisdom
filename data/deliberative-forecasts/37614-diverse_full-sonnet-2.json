    "review": "Both forecasters make solid arguments and we're all clustered in the 20-30% range, which suggests reasonable convergence. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the critical distinction between political fitness and criminal guilt - voters can judge Metz unfit regardless of the trial outcome. This is a strong point. Forecaster 3 raises important considerations about timing (ballots already mailed in late April) and mail-ballot dynamics, plus status quo advantages in small electorates. The key new consideration is that we're 8 days from the election with ballots already out - the campaign is essentially over, and many votes may already be cast. This increases uncertainty since we have no visibility into ballot returns or late-breaking dynamics. Forecaster 3's 30% feels slightly generous given the severity of shooting an unarmed teenager taking homecoming pictures - this is not a policy dispute but an alleged violent crime against a minor that the sheriff explicitly said was doing nothing wrong. However, their points about extreme uncertainty in tiny electorates and potential cohesive support networks are valid.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 20% to 25% for Metz winning. The key factors influencing this modest update: (1) Both forecasters emphasize the extreme uncertainty inherent in an electorate of under 400 voters with zero polling data - this warrants more caution about confident predictions. (2) The 40% historical survival rate for recalls provides a meaningful floor that I may have underweighted. (3) In a town of 500-600 people, personal relationships and unknown local dynamics could be more powerful than I initially credited. (4) We genuinely don't know if there are mitigating circumstances or how Metz has positioned his defense locally. However, I'm not moving to 30% because the core facts remain devastating: an unarmed 17-year-old taking homecoming pictures was shot in the face, with law enforcement explicitly stating no criminal intent from the victim. This is nearly impossible to defend politically in any community. The successful petition certification shows organized opposition exists, and recent Colorado small-town recalls have succeeded. The balance of evidence still strongly favors removal, but the uncertainty factors warrant a slightly less confident forecast than my initial 20%.",
