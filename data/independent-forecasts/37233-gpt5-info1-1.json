  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until end of May 31, 2025, Abidjan time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no declaration by June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara keeps options open and delays any announcement until after June, allowing RHDP to weigh successors (e.g., VP or PM) and to calibrate against opposition moves; he may ultimately endorse a successor or even remain ambiguous until late summer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP schedules a May congress or leadership meeting at which Ouattara accepts the party’s call to run, or he delivers a national address in May framing continuity and stability as necessitating his candidacy, prompting immediate, widely reported declaration.",
    "rationale": "- Current signals: According to the research assistant, in January 2025 Ouattara told the diplomatic corps he was in perfect health and ready to continue serving but had not decided on a candidacy, and he highlighted that RHDP has many potential candidates. That stance, four months later, points to deliberate timing and suggests no rush to declare by May.\n- Timing norms and precedent: In 2020, Ouattara declared relatively late (about three months before the vote) and only after a shock (the death of his designated successor). With the 2025 election in October, there is no hard necessity to declare by late May; candidacy filings and investiture typically occur later. Many incumbents in the region time declarations for strategic leverage, often closer to party conventions or legal deadlines.\n- Structural incentives: Declaring early can create lame-duck dynamics and galvanize opposition; staying noncommittal preserves flexibility and party discipline. The presence of multiple viable RHDP figures (as he himself underscored) makes a late endorsement or late personal decision plausible.\n- Why not higher: There is no reported May RHDP congress or fixed date compelling a May declaration; his January remarks imply intentional delay. The base case is continued ambiguity into June.\n- Why not lower: Ouattara has a track record of reversing earlier intentions under perceived necessity (2020). If RHDP coalesces behind him or if security/economic or opposition developments increase demand for continuity, a May declaration is plausible. A single, well-publicized party conclave or televised address could flip the outcome.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an RHDP congress/investiture or National Council meeting scheduled in May with signals he will accept; coordinated messaging by senior RHDP figures urging his candidacy; leaks of campaign infrastructure being readied now.\n- What would move me down: Public moves to elevate and vet a successor (e.g., VP/PM-led campaign structures), statements hinting he will be an arbiter not a candidate, or a published RHDP timetable placing investiture after June.\nGiven the short 32-day window and absent a known May event, I place extra weight on the status quo of continued delay.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
