    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior take: strong status quo/incentives, with primary downside from regulatory/legal action and the brittle “every day” requirement. New/useful emphasis from them: (1) compounding daily failure risk across 30 days and (2) timing risk concentrated in early June if the Nevada court moves quickly. They also articulate the likely scope of an adverse Nevada outcome (geoblocking vs. nationwide halt). The exogenous risk of a zero-MLB-game day is a fair mention but extremely small in June. I don’t see materially new evidence that would shift the base rate, but the compounding framing slightly reinforces the already-accounted operational tail risk.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that Kalshi continues posting at least one MLB game market every day in June, driven by sports being a core revenue engine and the established daily cadence since mid-April. The most credible threat is a legal/regulatory shock; however, a Nevada ruling is more likely to produce state-level geoblocking than a nationwide pause. CFTC-driven action remains a tail risk, and the all-days criterion makes a single missed day fatal, but there’s no concrete signal of an imminent nationwide suspension. Given these, and incorporating the compounding-daily-risk framing (which I had already qualitatively considered), I’m maintaining my forecast. I would update downward on any injunction/TRO or Kalshi announcement pausing sports nationally; upward if early June proceeds without gaps and any Nevada ruling is clearly narrow.",
