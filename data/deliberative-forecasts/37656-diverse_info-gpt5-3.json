    "review": "Forecaster 2 strengthens the case that a legislative path is essentially closed in the six-week window, noting intra-party Senate opposition and filibuster dynamics. That aligns with my prior but makes the already-small “must-pass attachment” route even smaller. Forecaster 3’s 60% leans heavily on the May 2 EO and the time remaining; however, it underweights the legal/appropriations constraints and the CPB lawsuit, and the fact the tracker did not flip to “complete” post-EO suggests the maintainers require demonstrated funding cessation, not just an order. Net: F2’s argument nudges me slightly down; F3 does not persuade me upward given the litigation and Impoundment Control Act/friction in execution.",
    "rationale": "My baseline (12%) assumed: (1) the tracker seems to require tangible cessation of funding (since it stayed “in progress” after the EO); (2) CPB’s forward funding and independence plus the Impoundment Control Act make sustained withholding unlikely; (3) litigation likely yields a TRO/preliminary injunction before any durable stop; and (4) a legislative fix before July 1 is extremely unlikely. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on Senate math/intra-party resistance further lowers the already small chance of a rapid statutory route or a rider on a must-pass vehicle in the next ~45 days. Forecaster 3’s optimism hinges on the EO and remaining time, but doesn’t overcome the legal/appropriations hurdles and the tracker’s apparent higher bar for “complete.” I therefore trim my forecast modestly, reflecting a tiny chance that administrative actions briefly halt disbursements and the tracker decides that meets their bar—and that it persists through July 1—but keeping the probability low given likely court intervention and forward appropriations.",
