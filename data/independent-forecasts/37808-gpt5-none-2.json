    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the DV Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains accessible at the specified URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "State Department restructures travel.state.gov before July 1 and the exact URL returns a 404 or a generic page; or the page is retitled/reorganized so that the “Step 1 Submit an Entry” page no longer exists at that path; or an outage occurs precisely when Metaculus checks and the page is unavailable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The DV program continues unchanged and the existing instructions page remains published at the same URL (even if the entry period is closed), or the URL cleanly resolves and presents the Step 1 instructions content when accessed on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/Status quo: The Diversity Visa is a statutory program; eliminating it requires Congress. Historically, the DV instructions pages on travel.state.gov persist year-round, even outside the October–November entry window. Government sites generally maintain stable URL structures or long-lived redirects.\n- Short horizon: With only ~6 weeks to go, the probability of a major policy change or a full site restructure that removes this specific page is low.\n- Risks lowering the probability: (1) Website reorganization that changes the slug (e.g., replacing “diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html”) without leaving a working redirect; (2) content taxonomy changes that rename or merge “Step 1 Submit an Entry” so the page at that exact path is no longer the Step 1 instructions; (3) ambiguity over whether a 301/302 redirect qualifies as “at this location”; (4) transient downtime at the moment Metaculus checks.\n- Why not higher: Those small but real risks (particularly URL changes and strict interpretation of “at this location”) keep me from going above the low–mid 90s.\n- Why not lower: There’s no active legislative or administrative move (within this short timeframe) likely to remove the DV program or purge its guidance pages, and State’s visa content has historically been stable across months.\n- Updates that would move me up: Independent confirmation that this exact URL currently returns the Step 1 page and that State has no pending web-CMS migration; evidence of long-term stability of this slug (e.g., recent snapshots).\n- Updates that would move me down: Any announcement of a travel.state.gov restructure, observed redirects/404 at this path, or guidance indicating the DV instructions are being consolidated under new URLs.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so the forecast relies on general institutional stability and known process cycles for DV and federal web content management.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
