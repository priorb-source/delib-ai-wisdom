    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: weak domestic demand, continued PPI deflation, and food as the key drag, with holiday-related services as the main upside risk. The new emphasis I found most useful is that the May Day services bump is largely seasonal and was present last year, limiting YoY uplift—this slightly strengthens the case for another small negative. Their base-effect framing (May 2024 modestly positive) is consistent with a mild headwind to a positive YoY print. Neither added hard high-frequency data; they didn’t address the FRED rounding issue near zero, which I still view as a meaningful source of uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see a close call around zero, with weak goods pricing and soft food offset by modest services firmness. Energy isn’t likely to swing the headline positive on a YoY basis, and base effects are not especially supportive of a flip above zero. With three consecutive negative YoY prints into April and limited evidence of a demand inflection in May, persistence argues for a fourth negative. I nudge my probability up slightly to reflect the point that May’s holiday effect is largely embedded in last year’s base. I retain caution due to the resolution hinging on the FRED OECD series and its rounding near zero, which could turn a tiny negative into a displayed 0.0.",
