  "information": "Historical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The FATF Plenary is in June 2025, with results typically published in late June.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The FATF 'grey list' of Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring remains unchanged following the June 2025 plenary.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No jurisdictions are added to or removed from the FATF grey list. This could occur if countries slated for review do not meet the criteria for a status change, and the plenary focuses on other strategic initiatives, resulting in a rare pause in list modifications.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is either added to or removed from the FATF grey list. For example, a country that has been on the list for some time successfully completes its action plan and is delisted, or a new jurisdiction is identified with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and is added.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the strong historical precedent. The research provided indicates that out of 17 FATF plenaries since 2018, 16 have resulted in changes to the grey list—a base rate of approximately 94%. The single exception occurred during an October 2020 virtual meeting disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, an extraordinary circumstance not currently present. The FATF's monitoring process is inherently dynamic, designed to continuously review, list, and delist countries as they address or develop deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) frameworks. With 25 jurisdictions currently on the list, there are many candidates for potential removal at any given time, just as the FATF's ongoing evaluations of other countries create candidates for addition. The systemic nature of this process makes a static outcome highly improbable. My forecast is not higher than 95% to account for the small but non-zero possibility of an unforeseen event, such as a major geopolitical crisis disrupting the plenary or a unique confluence of procedural delays for all candidate countries. It is not lower because that would understate the overwhelming historical trend and the fundamental purpose of the FATF plenary meetings, which is to review and act upon country evaluations. I would lower my forecast if credible reports suggested the plenary's agenda was unusually limited or disrupted. I would raise it if an official source indicated a change was certain.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
