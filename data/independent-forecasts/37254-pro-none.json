    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Russia remains focused on its war in Ukraine and does not launch a new ground invasion of another country. The US therefore does not make such an accusation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues to concentrate its military efforts and resources on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The high risks of military overstretch, severe international backlash, and potential escalation with NATO deter Russia from sending ground forces into any other country. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any new Russian invasion, and thus no related accusation from the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Perceiving a window of opportunity due to a sudden Ukrainian military collapse in the south or significant political instability in Chișinău, Russia uses its forces in the breakaway region of Transnistria to launch an invasion of Moldova. The US government promptly and publicly condemns the action, accusing Russia of a blatant invasion of a sovereign nation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 2%. The primary driver for this low probability is the extremely short two-month timeframe combined with Russia's deep military and economic commitment to its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian military is severely stretched, and launching a new ground invasion of another country would be a monumental strategic risk that it likely cannot afford. The status quo, in which Russia's military aggression is confined to Ukraine, is a strong predictor of near-term events.\n\nThis forecast is not lower than 2% because the possibility of a rapid, unforeseen escalation cannot be completely dismissed. The most plausible, though still unlikely, scenario would involve an invasion of a non-NATO state like Moldova, potentially precipitated by a sudden change on the battlefield in southern Ukraine or a political crisis in Moldova that Russia chooses to exploit. The Kremlin has demonstrated a high tolerance for risk and a capacity for strategic surprise in the past.\n\nThe probability is not higher because the deterrents against such an action are formidable. These include the risk of military overstretch, further crippling international sanctions, and the potential for a wider conflict. Launching another major offensive would require resources that Russia is currently dedicating to its difficult campaign in Ukraine.\n\nI would increase my forecast given credible intelligence of significant Russian troop buildups on the border of a neighboring country like Moldova or Georgia, or in the event of a sudden political collapse in one of those nations. Conversely, I would lower my forecast as the deadline approaches without any such escalatory indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
