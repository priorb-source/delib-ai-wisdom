    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. China continues its current posture of military exercises and 'gray-zone' pressure tactics, but does not implement a full blockade of a Taiwanese seaport. The US continues to condemn these actions but does not accuse China of a blockade.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China conducts several large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in the coming weeks, which temporarily disrupt air and sea traffic. However, these actions are framed as drills, they are limited in duration, and they do not constitute a persistent, targeted interdiction of a specific seaport. The US condemns the exercises as 'provocative' and 'destabilizing' but refrains from using the term 'blockade.' The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without this specific accusation being made.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following a perceived major provocation, such as a high-level diplomatic breakthrough between the US and Taiwan, China declares a 'customs and quarantine inspection zone' around the Port of Kaohsiung. Chinese coast guard and navy vessels begin stopping and inspecting all commercial ships attempting to enter or leave the port, effectively halting its operations. In response to this de facto blockade, the U.S. Secretary of State holds a press conference and publicly states that the People's Republic of China has illegally blockaded Taiwan, demanding an immediate cessation of these actions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the assessment that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would be a massive strategic escalation with severe and unpredictable consequences, making it a highly unlikely event within the very short timeframe of less than two months. The status quo, while tense, has not included a blockade, and such actions are typically reserved for moments of extreme crisis, bordering on open warfare. The economic repercussions for China and the global economy would be catastrophic, inviting severe international sanctions and risking a direct military confrontation with the United States and its allies. While China has been increasing its military pressure and 'gray-zone' activities, a full blockade crosses a critical threshold from coercion to a potential act of war. The Chinese leadership is generally considered to be pragmatic and risk-averse regarding actions that could threaten its economic stability and internal control. The short window until July 1, 2025, makes a sudden shift to such a high-risk strategy improbable without a major, unforeseen triggering event. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the situation is volatile, and a miscalculation or an unexpected political crisis could lead to a rapid escalation. China's military is increasingly capable of enforcing such a blockade, as noted in public analyses. I would increase my forecast if there were credible intelligence or public signaling (e.g., evacuation of civilians, a massive naval buildup beyond exercise norms) indicating imminent action, or if a major political crisis erupted, such as Taiwan taking formal steps towards independence. I would decrease my forecast if diplomatic channels showed progress in de-escalating tensions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
