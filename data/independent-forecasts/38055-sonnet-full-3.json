This is a rebooked fight, originally scheduled for UFC Mexico on March 29 before being cancelled. According to UFCStats 'tale of the tape' data, Pyfer has a slight grappling and reach advantage, while Gastelum fights from a southpaw stance.\n\nJoe Pyfer has won six of his last seven professional fights, holding a 4-1 record within the UFC. His most recent victory was a first-round knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, which earned him a Performance of the Night bonus.

    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer defeats Gastelum (or a potential late replacement opponent) at UFC 316 via knockout, submission, or decision",
    "rationale": "With 12 days until the event, the fight is confirmed and on the main card at Prudential Center in Newark. The primary risks are: (1) the fight doesn't happen, and (2) Pyfer loses if it does happen. Fight cancellation risk is relatively low given the proximity to the event and that both fighters appear healthy - Pyfer recovered from his illness that caused the Mexico withdrawal. I estimate ~87% probability the fight happens. For the fight outcome, Pyfer shows strong recent form (6-1 in last 7, recent KO victory with bonus, 4-1 UFC record) and has physical advantages (reach, grappling) per the tale of the tape. However, Gastelum is a highly experienced UFC veteran (24th UFC appearance, TUF 17 winner) fighting his 3rd fight in recent return to form (2-1 in last 3). Gastelum's southpaw stance and experience are real challenges. Pyfer fighting near home in New Jersey may provide a small advantage. I estimate Pyfer has approximately 60% chance of winning if the fight happens, factoring in his momentum against Gastelum's experience. Combined probability: 0.87 × 0.60 ≈ 52%, with small additional chance (~2%) of a late replacement opponent who Pyfer might have better odds against. My forecast would increase if Pyfer showed dominant form in pre-fight media or if Gastelum showed signs of decline. It would decrease if injury concerns emerged or if fight metrics showed Gastelum as a significant favorite.",
