    "review": "Both forecasters underscored the key resolution nuance: the outcome depends on that specific page explicitly naming Tesla as ineligible, not merely on the underlying policy. They also added credible reasons why the explicit brand callout is likely to persist—Tesla’s dominance and the desire to reduce customer confusion and contact volume. The emphasis on short time horizon and bureaucratic inertia aligns with my view. Forecaster 3’s point about aligning with Canadian manufacturers (e.g., FLO/United Chargers) adds context supporting policy stickiness. I didn’t see strong counterarguments suggesting imminent reversal or a likely June content overhaul.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see three main paths: (1) policy unchanged and explicit Tesla exclusion remains on the target page (most likely); (2) policy unchanged but wording is generalized or moved off the page, which would resolve No; (3) policy softening/reversal (low on this time frame). The additional argument that naming Tesla reduces confusion and contact center load increases the odds that BC Hydro keeps the explicit callout through July. Given the very short horizon and recent political signal, the chance of a substantive reversal remains small. My base was 76% due to the non-trivial risk of a content rewrite or migration of the brand-specific wording. In light of the others’ points about incentives to maintain the explicit mention and the short time window, I’m nudging up. Roughly: P(policy unchanged) ~95%; P(explicit mention on that page | policy unchanged) ~84–85%, implying ~80–81% overall. I’ll set 80%.",
