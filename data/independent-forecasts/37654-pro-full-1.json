  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective to break up NOAA will remain marked as 'in progress' on the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to take actions that weaken NOAA, such as budget cuts and program cancellations, but does not finalize and sign a formal executive order or pass legislation to 'break up' the agency before July 1, 2025. As a result, the spreadsheet's status for this objective remains 'in progress' at the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration prioritizes and fast-tracks an executive reorganization plan, culminating in a signed executive order that formally breaks up or restructures NOAA before July 1, 2025. Following this definitive action, the moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker update the objective's status to 'complete'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant procedural and temporal hurdles required to formally 'break up' a federal agency within the short, 1.5-month timeframe. The current status of the objective is 'in progress', and this is the most likely outcome to persist.\n\nThe research indicates that such a reorganization requires a formal action like a signed executive order or an enacted statute to be marked 'complete' by the tracker. Historically, even an executive reorganization takes a minimum of two to six months to finalize, which places our July 1 deadline at the absolute low end of, or outside, a typical timeframe. A legislative solution is even less likely, with Senate action not expected until mid-July at the earliest.\n\nWhile the administration has shown clear intent by discontinuing NOAA's disasters database and proposing a 25% budget cut, these actions are part of the process of weakening the agency, not the final formal act of breaking it up. They are consistent with the 'in progress' status. Furthermore, the tracker itself has a low base rate of change, having moved only 5 of 41 'in progress' objectives to 'complete' over the preceding 4.5 months.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 15% because the administration's actions demonstrate strong momentum and intent. There is a non-zero possibility that an executive order has already been drafted and could be fast-tracked through the final stages of review, defying historical timelines. The probability is not higher because the bureaucratic and legal processes involved in a major government reorganization are substantial and difficult to complete in just over six weeks.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a nearly-finalized executive order. I would decrease it if administration officials indicated their strategy relied on the longer-term legislative or budget process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
