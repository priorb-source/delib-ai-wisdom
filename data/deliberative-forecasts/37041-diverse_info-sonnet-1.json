    "review": "The other forecasters raised several compelling points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies that TWO compounding events are needed: (1) confirmed local transmission or epizootic in a North American country AND (2) CDC issuing a Travel Health Notice by June 1. This compounds probabilities significantly. Forecaster 3 strongly emphasizes the timeline constraint - approximately 5 weeks is very short for the entire cascade: viral introduction → local transmission → detection → investigation → CDC administrative action. Both forecasters note that CDC Travel Health Notices for North American countries are historically very rare, and Forecaster 2 adds the important distinction that CDC issues notices for unusual events/outbreaks, not routine endemic risk. This means even if there were background risk, it wouldn't automatically trigger a notice. Forecaster 2's specific pathway analysis (Colombia → Darién → Panama via sylvatic transmission) is more detailed than my general assessment. These are all valid points that suggest I was too high at 18%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, I'm updating downward based on three key insights: (1) The timeline of 5-6 weeks is indeed very tight for the full sequence of events needed - not just an outbreak, but detection, investigation, and CDC decision-making and notice posting. (2) CDC Travel Health Notices for North American countries are historically rare even in regions with endemic risk, because CDC issues these for unusual events rather than background risk. (3) Two compounding low-probability events must both occur: local transmission/epizootic in a NA country AND CDC issuing a notice by June 1. However, I'm not dropping as low as Forecaster 3's 5% because: the South American outbreak is significant (131 cases in Q1 2025, more than double all of 2024), there's a plausible transmission pathway from Colombia to Panama, the vector is confirmed present in Central America, and Costa Rica's vaccination mandate indicates regional health authorities perceive real risk. While the timeline is tight, CDC can act relatively quickly for emerging threats. Balancing the strong status quo and historical rarity against the active regional outbreak and plausible transmission routes, I'm settling on 12%.",
