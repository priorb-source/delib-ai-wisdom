    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable insights. Forecaster 2 introduces crucial new information: the EU tariff deadline was just postponed from June 1 to July 9, 2025, with ongoing frustrated negotiations. This is significant - it means tariff stories will likely intensify throughout June as this new deadline approaches, rather than diminishing. This directly contradicts any expectation of reduced coverage. Forecaster 3 makes the excellent observation that we're already 7 days into the tracking window (since May 19), and if coverage has been continuous so far, this reinforces the strength of the status quo. All three of us converge on the key insight: requiring BOTH papers to omit tariffs on the SAME day is the critical constraint that makes this difficult. We also all recognize the WSJ's particular commitment to covering major economic policy given its business-focused readership. However, I find Forecaster 3's 28% forecast slightly optimistic given the EU deadline information. The 'summer slow news cycle' argument is weak when dealing with such a major, active economic policy story with concrete deadlines approaching. All forecasters correctly identify that only needing ONE day out of 36 provides some probability, but the EU negotiations timeline suggests June will be particularly active for tariff coverage.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, the EU tariff deadline information is the most significant new factor. The postponement to July 9 means the June period (which comprises most of our tracking window) will likely see INTENSIFIED coverage as negotiations continue and the deadline approaches, not reduced coverage. This works against the Yes outcome. The observation that we're already 7 days into the window with presumably continuous coverage also strengthens the case that the status quo is very sticky. However, I maintain that 36 days still provides some reasonable probability of one day where extraordinary competing news dominates both front pages simultaneously - perhaps a major international crisis, domestic emergency, or Supreme Court bombshell. The fundamental challenge remains: both papers must coincide. The WSJ's business focus makes it particularly unlikely to drop tariff coverage during active trade negotiations. Given the EU deadline context suggesting June intensification rather than quieting, I'm updating my forecast DOWN slightly from 20% to 17%. The new information about approaching deadlines reduces the likelihood of a gap in coverage.",
