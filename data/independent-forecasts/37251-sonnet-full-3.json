  "information": "According to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million. The deal was expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025 and would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam. If completed, Vietnam would become the 10th foreign country to acquire the K9 system.\n\nActions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace. In November 2024, Vietnamese troops also participated in a training program in South Korea for using the K9 howitzer. The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.\n\nThe potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Hanwha Aerospace, the manufacturer of the K9, has been actively securing defense contracts globally, with significant sales to Poland, Australia, and Egypt. The company reported a substantial increase in its first-quarter 2025 sales, driven by exports of the K9, and noted expectations for more orders in the second half of the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made. The status quo is that no agreement has been publicly announced by either government, so the question would resolve as No if this continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations encounter delays due to contractual details, financing arrangements, or political sensitivities regarding China's reaction. The deal timeline extends beyond July 1, 2025, or negotiations stall entirely due to changing defense priorities or budget constraints in Vietnam.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Vietnam and South Korea finalize the outstanding contractual details and publicly announce the K9 howitzer agreement within the next two months. The announcement could occur during a scheduled diplomatic visit, through official government press releases, or at a defense ministry event prior to July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a mixed picture. Strong positives include: negotiations were reportedly in 'final stages' as of January 2025 with Q1 2025 as the expected timeline; extensive groundwork has been completed including Vietnamese troops training on K9 systems in November 2024 and the Defense Minister's inspection visit in 2023; the deal aligns with Vietnam's strategic goal to diversify from Russian suppliers amid South China Sea tensions; and South Korea has momentum in defense exports. However, concerning factors include: Q1 2025 has passed without announcement, suggesting the timeline has slipped; no recent updates (post-January) confirm progress; only 2 months remain until deadline; and major defense deals commonly face delays. The status quo principle suggests I should weight the current state (no announcement) heavily, as the world changes slowly. The deal's strong strategic fit and extensive preparation prevent me from going lower, but the missed Q1 target and lack of recent confirmation prevent me from going higher. I would update upward with news of continued negotiations or scheduled high-level visits, and downward if June passes without developments or reports emerge of stalled talks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
