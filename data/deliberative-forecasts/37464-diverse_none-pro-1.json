    "review": "My initial forecast of 40% was a balance between the recall's simple nature and the potential for bureaucratic delay. Forecaster 2 (32%) reinforced the pessimistic view, emphasizing that the recall remains 'Active' after 2.5 months and that the remaining 24-day window is short. Forecaster 3 (76%) provided the most compelling new argument by introducing a base rate, suggesting that small, limited-distribution FSIS recalls of this type typically close within 60-100 days. This 'outside view' was a perspective I had not sufficiently weighted. It reframes the elapsed time not as a negative sign (as Forecaster 2 argued), but as evidence that we are now entering the most probable window for closure. Forecaster 3's reasoning, grounded in the typical lifecycle of such an event, is more persuasive than a general concern about bureaucracy or an over-reliance on the current status quo.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the compelling base-rate argument from Forecaster 3. My initial analysis treated the potential for government delay as a major unknown. However, Forecaster 3’s assertion that similar recalls often close within a 60-100 day window provides a crucial anchor. The resolution deadline of June 1 is 97 days after the recall was issued, placing it at the upper end of this typical timeframe. As of today, 73 days have passed, meaning the recall is squarely within the period where closure is most expected. The recall's characteristics—limited distribution to vending machines in one state and a short-shelf-life product—align perfectly with the type of simple case that should resolve relatively quickly, consistent with this base rate. I am therefore shifting my forecast from 40% to 65%. I am not moving as high as Forecaster 3's 76% because I want to reserve significant weight for the possibility of administrative friction or unforeseen minor issues causing the final status update on the USDA website to be delayed past the deadline, a risk that Forecaster 2 rightly highlights with their focus on the short remaining time.",
