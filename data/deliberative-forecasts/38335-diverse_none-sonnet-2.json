    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the core assessment: Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, poor polling for Casey DeSantis, no visible announcement signals, and limited time remaining create strong headwinds for a Yes outcome. Forecaster 3 raises the most novel argument I hadn't fully weighted - the Q2 fundraising deadline (June 30) creates a plausible strategic incentive for a late-June announcement to capture donor commitments in the first reporting period. This is a legitimate consideration for serious campaigns. Forecaster 3 also notes that mid-2025 announcements are common for 2026 Florida gubernatorial races, providing useful baseline context. However, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on strategic weakness particularly compelling: launching a campaign after trailing in polls and facing Trump's endorsed opponent would be politically costly. The complete absence of pre-announcement signals (staff hires, event scheduling, filings) by early June is highly informative - if the fundraising deadline were truly driving an imminent announcement, we'd expect to see preparation activities by now. The forecasts span 10-24%, with mine at 18%. This range reflects genuine uncertainty about political decision-making, but the preponderance of evidence favors the status quo.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest downward adjustment. The fundraising deadline argument is valid but insufficient to overcome the weight of evidence against an announcement. The key factors remain: (1) No announcement yet with only 26 days remaining; (2) Zero reported signals of campaign preparation - no staff hires, no scheduled events, no filings; (3) Trump's endorsement of Donalds creates a formidable obstacle in Florida GOP politics; (4) Recent polling shows her trailing, making immediate entry strategically questionable. Forecaster 2's point about strategic disadvantage resonates - launching from weakness invites further damage. If the Q2 fundraising deadline were genuinely driving decision-making, we'd expect visible preparation by early June. The absence of any such signals is itself strong evidence. I'm adjusting slightly downward from 18% to 16%, giving modest weight to the fundraising incentive and the 26-day window while recognizing that the overwhelming evidence points toward No. The status quo is powerful, and political campaigns don't typically materialize from nothing in under a month without any preliminary signals.",
