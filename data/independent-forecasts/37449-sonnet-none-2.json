    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there is currently no Chinese blockade of Taiwan and no US accusation of such a blockade",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China does not initiate a blockade of Taiwan's seaports in the next two months, maintaining the current strategic status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Alternatively, if any military activities occur, they are not characterized as a blockade by US officials, or remain below the threshold that would prompt a formal public accusation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates tensions dramatically in the next two months by initiating a military blockade of one or more Taiwanese seaports, perhaps in response to a political crisis or as part of a coordinated military campaign. The US government publicly and formally accuses China of this blockade, likely through statements from the White House, State Department, or Defense Department.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo given the extremely short timeframe of approximately 8 weeks. A Chinese blockade of Taiwan would represent a major military escalation with severe geopolitical consequences, potentially triggering armed conflict with the United States. Such dramatic actions are rarely executed without preceding warning signs including: diplomatic crises, explicit ultimatums, major military mobilizations, and escalating incidents. My research assistant provided no information suggesting any imminent crisis or heightened tensions beyond normal cross-strait dynamics. While the WSJ article indicates China has developed blockade capabilities, capability does not equal intent or imminent action. Historical precedent shows that major military actions of this magnitude typically evolve over months with clear escalatory patterns. The forecast is not lower (closer to 1-2%) because: (1) the question only requires a US accusation rather than a verified blockade, leaving room for mischaracterization or political rhetoric; (2) unforeseen accidents or miscalculations could rapidly escalate; (3) gray-zone operations could potentially be labeled as blockades. The forecast is not higher because there are no current indicators of crisis, China would face catastrophic economic and military consequences, and the timeframe is too compressed for normal escalation patterns. I would revise upward with reports of Chinese military mobilization near Taiwan, ultimatums to Taipei, or breaking diplomatic relations. I would revise downward with positive US-China summits or explicit Chinese commitments to peaceful resolution.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
