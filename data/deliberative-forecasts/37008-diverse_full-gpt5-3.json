    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately weight the default path: the proclamation explicitly ends April 29 and, as of April 21, there’s no signal of an extension. They emphasize that temporary generators coming online by end-April align with letting the SOE lapse, and that extensions would likely be telegraphed. I hadn’t fully penalized my prior for the lack of extension signaling this close to the end date. Their ranges (15–22%) reflect a reasonable base case with room for slippage risk. I still think there’s non-trivial tail risk of commissioning delays or a desire to preserve emergency powers into early May, but my prior 35% looks high given the current signals and the status quo bias.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: the SOE is scheduled to end April 29; NEOC reiterated that date on April 15; as of April 21, no extension hints; temporary generators expected by end-April; permanent fix by August. The main path to Yes is a short extension due to delays or insufficient stability during commissioning. The absence of any extension signaling one week out is weak evidence against extension, and the government has reputational incentive to end the SOE if the temporary capacity is close. I’m updating down to reflect stronger weighting of the default lapse and the lack of public cues, while retaining meaningful probability for last-minute extension if generators slip or reliability remains poor. I would move up on credible reports of delays or continued severe load shedding late in the month; down on confirmation of generators online and stable before April 29 or explicit statements that the SOE will lapse on schedule.",
