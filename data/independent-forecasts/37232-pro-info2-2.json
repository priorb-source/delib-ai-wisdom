  "information": "Virgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be determined after May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company's last post was on January 30, 2025. The established pattern for the last three months has been no new posts on this page. Continuing this trend through May represents the status quo.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic announces a significant operational or marketing milestone in May. This could include news about the development of their Delta-class ships, a new commercial partnership, or an event related to the final flights of VSS Unity, which they decide is worthy of a post on the main news page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current communications pattern persists. Virgin Galactic remains in a 'heads-down' period focusing on engineering and development, with no major public-facing milestones to announce in May. The scheduled Q1 2025 earnings release is handled exclusively via the Investor Relations section, consistent with recent practice, and no other news is posted to the main News page.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Virgin Galactic's recent posting frequency, which represents a strong status quo. As of late April 2025, there have been no new posts on their News page for nearly three months (February, March, April), a significant departure from their historical cadence. This suggests a low likelihood of a post in any given month. Critically, information from my research assistant confirms that the most predictable news event in the forecast window, the Q1 2025 earnings release on May 15, is highly unlikely to appear on this specific page. This is because previous financial results and announcements were distributed via Investor Relations and press wires, not the main News page. This precedent removes the most probable catalyst for a post in May. My probability is not higher than 85% because Virgin Galactic is a high-profile company, and an unexpected event, such as a new partnership or a significant technical milestone, could trigger a post at any time. A 15% chance accounts for this uncertainty. My probability is not lower because the combination of the multi-month silence and the specific evidence regarding the handling of financial news makes a 'Yes' outcome highly likely. I would lower my forecast if credible rumors emerged of a major, non-financial announcement or flight scheduled for May. I would raise it if the company confirmed its final VSS Unity flight was scheduled for June or later, removing it as a potential May news item.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
