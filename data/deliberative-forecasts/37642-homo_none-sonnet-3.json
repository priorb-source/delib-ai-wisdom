    "review": "The three forecasts cluster tightly (25%, 35%, 25%), suggesting we're converging on the right probability range. All of us identify similar key factors: the recent pause signal, one likely FOMC meeting in June, status quo bias, and the Fed's deliberate approach. Forecaster 2's higher forecast (35%) appears to weight more heavily the fact that the Fed was recently in a cutting cycle, suggesting greater willingness to resume cuts if conditions warrant. This is a reasonable consideration - a Fed that has recently been cutting may be more responsive to data suggesting further easing is needed, compared to a Fed that has never been cutting. However, I find the pause itself to be the stronger signal. The JP Morgan report specifically notes the Fed 'decided to pause,' which suggests a deliberate policy choice rather than a temporary hold. Central banks don't pause casually - it typically signals satisfaction with the current policy stance and a desire to assess lagged effects. When the Fed pauses after cutting, historical patterns show they tend to remain paused for multiple meetings rather than quickly resuming cuts within 6-8 weeks. The burden of proof for a near-term reversal is high, requiring either significant economic deterioration or unexpected shocks. While Forecaster 2's point about recent cutting willingness has merit, I believe the pause signal dominates.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the recent pause is the most important factor. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's valid point that a Fed recently engaged in cutting might be more willing to resume than one that never started, the deliberate decision to pause suggests they have reached a policy stance they want to maintain while assessing conditions. The tight clustering of forecasts (25-35%) indicates we're in the appropriate range. With only one FOMC meeting likely before July 1, and no evidence of severe economic deterioration or disinflationary surprises that would prompt immediate action, the status quo strongly favors no cut. The Fed's data-dependent, forward-looking approach means they would need compelling evidence within the next few weeks to justify reversing their recent pause decision. While not impossible, this scenario remains unlikely within the 6.5-week timeframe. I see no compelling reason to move from my initial assessment.",
