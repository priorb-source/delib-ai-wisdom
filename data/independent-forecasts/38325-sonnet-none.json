    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate of quarterly GDP about 3 months after the quarter ends. Q1 2025 ended on March 31, 2025, so the third estimate should be released around June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the advance estimate showed -0.3% annualized real GDP growth, which is below 0.0%. If revisions follow typical patterns and don't substantially alter the initial estimate, the outcome would remain negative.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or shows continued negative GDP growth. This would occur if the initial -0.3% reading was reasonably accurate and data revisions are either minimal or slightly downward. The advance estimate's negative reading holds, keeping Q1 2025 GDP at or below 0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate is revised upward by more than 0.3 percentage points, turning the negative advance estimate into positive growth. This could happen if initial data substantially underestimated consumer spending, business investment, or other GDP components, or if there were data collection issues that get corrected in subsequent revisions.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate of -0.3% is very close to the 0.0% threshold, meaning a relatively modest upward revision of just over 0.3 percentage points would flip the outcome to Yes. Historical GDP revisions between advance and third estimates typically range from 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points in either direction, so such a revision is within the realm of possibility.\n\nHowever, revisions that change the sign from negative to positive (or vice versa) are relatively uncommon. The status quo strongly suggests the third estimate will remain negative or near-zero. Without specific information from the research assistant about data quality issues, component estimate problems, or other factors that might drive substantial upward revisions, I should weight the current negative reading heavily.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) sign-flipping revisions are historically infrequent, (2) no evidence suggests major errors in the advance estimate, and (3) the burden of proof lies with predicting change from the status quo.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) the -0.3% reading is extremely close to zero, making it vulnerable to even modest revisions, (2) GDP revisions of 0.5+ percentage points do occur regularly, and (3) there is inherent uncertainty in preliminary estimates.\n\nI would update higher if: the second estimate (released around May 29) showed substantial upward revision, if reports emerged of systematic data underestimation, or if economic indicators suggested the advance estimate missed strength in key sectors.\n\nI would update lower if: the second estimate revised the number further downward, or if detailed analysis confirmed the weakness in Q1 economic activity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
