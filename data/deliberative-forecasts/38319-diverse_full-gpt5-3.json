    "review": "Both forecasters make the same core case I used—mean reversion after a very large March jump, national April IP at −0.9% m/m, and Golden Week softness—while acknowledging the semiconductor/machinery strength noted by the BoJ. They added no new hard data, but their emphasis on the magnitude of the March surge and the plausibility of it being partly one-off/inventory-related is reasonable. I find their weighting of these headwinds slightly stronger than mine. I’d downplay business sentiment/bankruptcy figures as weak high-frequency predictors for a single month of IP, but I do think I underweighted fiscal year-end dynamics (March is often atypical), which can exacerbate April payback even after seasonal adjustment.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating slightly downward on two points: (1) the size of March’s +7.6% m/m and the negative serial correlation make an April pullback more likely than my prior 42% implied; (2) Japan’s fiscal year-end (March) can front-load production with some payback in April, consistent with the national −0.9% m/m print even after seasonal adjustment. Golden Week adds a residual headwind. Offsetting these are ongoing semiconductor-related strength and the BoJ’s ‘recovering’ assessment, which keep the chance of a small positive from falling too low. Net, I move modestly lower but stay above the lowest peer due to persistent AI/semiconductor demand and the fact that any small uptick resolves Yes.",
