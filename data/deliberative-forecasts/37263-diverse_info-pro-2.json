    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key drivers of this forecast. All three of us identify the short timeframe, Uber's strategic focus on larger markets, and the hostile local regulatory environment as powerful arguments for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2 adds useful texture by framing the regional 'base rate' of regulatory resistance in the Caribbean and highlighting the lack of public signals (PR, driver recruitment) that typically precede a launch. This reinforces the consensus. However, Forecaster 3 introduces a critical piece of new information that I had not considered: the existence of local ride-hailing competitors, GetMe Ride and the newly launched Conch Cab. This is a highly compelling point. It significantly diminishes the attractiveness of the market for Uber, as it is not an untapped opportunity, and it provides local political and business interests with homegrown alternatives to champion over a foreign entity. This new evidence substantially strengthens the case for 'No'.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward in light of the new information provided by Forecaster 3. My initial forecast of 5% was based on the high barriers to entry but left a small window open for a rapid, partnership-based 'Uber Taxi' launch, assuming a market vacuum. The revelation that Turks and Caicos already has two local ride-hailing services, including one that just launched in May 2025, fundamentally changes this calculation. This local competition makes the market less attractive for Uber to enter and makes it more likely that local regulators would protect or favor these domestic companies over a large international one. The arguments from Forecaster 2 about the lack of any operational signals and the high probability of continued regulatory resistance reinforce this conclusion. The combination of an extremely small market (only ~45,000 residents), a hostile regulatory stance, a very short timeline, and now, the confirmed presence of local competitors makes a successful Uber launch by July 1, 2025, exceedingly improbable. I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3% to reflect the significantly reduced likelihood of entry now that the market is known to not be a vacuum.",
