    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a compelling point I underweighted: the bureaucratic verification timeline. Even if ACC Central Kitchen recovers products quickly, FSIS must still verify completion and officially close the recall - this administrative layer adds predictable delay. Their emphasis that 68 days is 'compressed for a full recall cycle' including verification is well-taken. Forecaster 3 cites specific data (45-day mean, 70-day median) that wasn't in the original research assistant's report, which makes me skeptical of those numbers. However, their point about sitting 'just before the median threshold' would be meaningful if the data were accurate. I disagree with Forecaster 2's claim that frozen products are easier to track - products already in consumer freezers are actually harder to recover than fresh items quickly consumed. All three forecasts cluster in the 30-42% range, suggesting reasonable convergence on this being unlikely but not impossible.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm revising slightly downward. Forecaster 2's emphasis on bureaucratic verification processes is the key insight I underweighted. Even with favorable factors (limited NY scope, allergen vs pathogen, voluntary recall), the typical recall cycle requires: (1) product recovery, (2) company verification of recovery, (3) FSIS review and verification, and (4) official closure. This multi-step process with government verification rarely completes in under 70 days regardless of other factors. The 68-day total window from issuance to deadline is genuinely compressed. While the limited geographic scope remains a significant positive factor that distinguishes this from typical nationwide recalls, it may not be sufficient to overcome the structural timeline constraints of the FSIS closure process. The frozen product issue cuts both ways - easier to identify on shelves but harder to recover from consumer freezers where it may remain for months. My forecast moves from 38% to 35% to reflect stronger weight on the bureaucratic timeline constraints while maintaining that the limited scope provides meaningful but insufficient upside probability.",
