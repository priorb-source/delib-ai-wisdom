    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About two weeks (NBS May CPI is typically released around June 10–12; FRED updates shortly after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Holiday-driven services (airfares, hotels, dining) and a pork/food rebound lift headline CPI to around 0.0% to +0.2% YoY despite weak core, yielding a non-negative reading on FRED for May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food deflation (pork, vegetables) persists and core remains subdued amid property weakness; energy effects are modest. Headline CPI prints slightly negative (e.g., -0.1% to -0.4% YoY) on FRED for May 2025, making it the fourth consecutive month below zero.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: As of June 2, the May CPI print is imminent, with FRED reflecting it soon after. \n- Status quo: February–April 2025 were negative YoY (April confirmed by SCMP), indicating deflationary momentum. In slow-changing macro environments, persistence is common; I weight continuation of slight deflation more heavily.\n- Macro backdrop: Property downturn, weak domestic demand, and still-soft producer prices have kept core inflation low. Energy prices are not surging YoY enough to flip the headline decisively.\n- Food dynamics: Pork and some fresh food categories have been key drags. May often sees softer food prices; while the May Day holiday boosts services, that effect is largely seasonal and was present last year as well, limiting YoY uplift.\n- Base effects: May 2024 CPI was modestly positive, so the comparison base is not especially low; that makes a positive YoY print in May 2025 harder without a firm MoM rebound.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: The May Day holiday could have produced stronger-than-expected services inflation; pork prices may have rebounded late in the month; any such moves could nudge the headline just above zero.\n- Why not lower: We already have three straight negative prints and little sign of strong demand; absent a clear food or services surge, the path of least resistance is a small negative. But the magnitude is small enough that a flip to +0.1% is plausible.\n- What would update me: Early-June high-frequency data (Ministry of Agriculture pork prices, NBS food price indices), tourism/airfare data from the May holiday, and energy price moves. Stronger services and pork prices would push me toward No; continued food softness would push me toward Yes.\n- Research assistant report: No additional info provided; forecast leans on recent trend, standard seasonality, and base-effect reasoning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
