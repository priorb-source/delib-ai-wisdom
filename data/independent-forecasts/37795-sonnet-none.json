    "status_quo_outcome": "The Colorado Rockies are likely performing poorly given the context about losing fans, but whether they currently have or will maintain the absolute lowest winning percentage among all 30 MLB teams is uncertain without current standings data",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one other MLB team (such as traditional bottom-feeders or teams in rebuilding mode like the White Sox, Athletics, or Marlins) performs worse than the Rockies through mid-June, finishing with a lower winning percentage",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue their poor performance through early June and remain the worst team in baseball, with no other team falling below their winning percentage by June 15, 2025",
    "rationale": "The Colorado Rockies have been one of MLB's weaker franchises in recent years, consistently finishing near the bottom of standings. The article reference about losing a generation of fans suggests ongoing organizational struggles. However, having THE lowest winning percentage in all of MLB is a very specific outcome among 30 teams. While the Rockies are likely to be bottom-tier, there are typically 3-5 teams competing for worst record at any given time. Historical comparables include teams like the 2024 White Sox, rebuilding Athletics, or struggling Marlins who often vie for this distinction. Mid-June is still relatively early in the season (roughly 65-70 games played), meaning standings have more volatility than later in the year. Coors Field's hitter-friendly environment can occasionally help the Rockies score runs even when fundamentally weak. Without current standings data as of May 19, I must estimate they're likely bottom-5 but not guaranteed to be dead last. The probability is not higher because several teams typically struggle simultaneously and the specific 'worst' designation is narrow. It's not lower because the Rockies' organizational issues are well-documented and they're likely genuinely bad. I would update higher with evidence they're currently 2+ games worse than any other team, or lower if multiple teams are performing comparably poorly or worse.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
