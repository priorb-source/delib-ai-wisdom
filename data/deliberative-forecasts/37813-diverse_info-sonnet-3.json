    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises valuable points I partially overlooked: summer seasonality (June likely has higher reporting volume than December), posting lag risks (NUFORC may not have all June reports posted by July 1), and classification ambiguity (observers might use 'Rectangle' or 'Box' instead of 'Cube'). These are legitimate considerations that both increase probability (seasonality) and decrease it (posting lag, taxonomy issues).\n\nForecaster 3's 92% confidence seems inconsistent with the question's explicit statement that December 2024's six cube sightings were 'rare in the history of NUFORC.' If cube reports appeared in 'most months' as they claim, six wouldn't be characterized as rare. Their assertion of having 'reviewed other recent months' contradicts the question background's framing. Without supporting data, I cannot reconcile their forecast with the 'rare' descriptor. Either many months have zero cube sightings (supporting 'rare'), or most months have at least one (contradicting 'rare'). The question's language strongly suggests the former.\n\nForecaster 2's more cautious 55% aligns better with the evidence. The key insight is that 'rare' implies an irregular, low-frequency phenomenon where zero-cube months are common, not exceptional.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm maintaining my 60% forecast. Forecaster 2's seasonality argument (June as a high-volume summer month) provides modest upward pressure, but their posting lag and classification concerns provide modest downward pressure—these roughly cancel out. Forecaster 3's 92% cannot be reconciled with the question's 'rare' characterization without additional evidence I don't have access to. If December's six cube sightings were truly rare, then the baseline monthly probability of at least one cube sighting is likely around 40-50%. June's summer boost might push this to 55-65%. My original reasoning holds: we need only ONE sighting (lowering the bar significantly versus six), but 'rare' suggests many months have zero. The uncertainty around the true base rate, balanced against the low threshold, justifies a probability in the 55-65% range. I'm staying at 60% as a reasonable midpoint.",
