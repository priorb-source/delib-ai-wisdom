  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.\n\nAs a newer political party, Reform UK does not have the established local infrastructure and grassroots organization of the main parties active in Derbyshire. The party has encountered issues with candidate vetting, including a controversy involving their candidate for Bakewell, Max Bethell, who reportedly made racial slurs on social media. Historically, predecessor parties like UKIP and the Brexit Party did not succeed in translating national support into control of county councils.\n\nNational polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party retains control of the council, or is at least the largest party. Reform UK wins few, if any, seats, and does not come close to winning the most seats. This would be a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's national poll support fails to translate into victories under the First-Past-The-Post system. Their vote is spread too thinly across the 64 divisions, allowing Conservative and Labour candidates to win individual seats with pluralities. The lack of a mature local party infrastructure and negative press over candidate quality hampers their ability to win in specific localities, resulting in them winning a handful of seats at most.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A complete collapse of the Conservative vote in Derbyshire occurs, with the vast majority of those voters switching directly to Reform UK. This support proves to be highly geographically concentrated, allowing Reform candidates to win dozens of individual divisions. Labour and the Liberal Democrats fail to make significant inroads, leaving Reform UK to emerge as the largest single party on the council in a seismic political upset.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural barriers facing Reform UK, despite their strong national polling. The primary factor is the First-Past-The-Post electoral system, which heavily favors established parties and punishes newer parties whose support is widely distributed rather than geographically concentrated. The Conservative Party's current notional position of holding 57 of the 64 seats represents a massive incumbent advantage that is extremely difficult to overcome in a single election cycle. For Reform UK to win the most seats, they would need to go from zero seats to likely winning over 25 seats, an unprecedented swing for a new party in a local election. Historical precedent from predecessor parties like UKIP, which also enjoyed periods of high national support, shows a failure to convert this into widespread control of local councils. Furthermore, the report highlights Reform UK's weaknesses at a local level, such as a lack of established grassroots organization and issues with candidate vetting, which can significantly damage credibility in local contests. While their national poll numbers of 23-25% are notable, it is far more likely this will split the right-wing vote, potentially allowing Labour to gain seats, rather than leading to a plurality of seats for Reform.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because the national political environment is highly volatile. A 23-25% national vote share is significant, and if the Conservative vote collapses more severely than anticipated and transfers almost entirely to Reform, an upset cannot be entirely ruled out. Professor Curtice's observation that their vote may be geographically concentrated is the key variable that allows for a small possibility of a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the combination of the FPTP system, the scale of the Conservative incumbency, Reform's lack of local infrastructure, and historical precedent makes a 'Yes' outcome an extreme longshot. \n\nI would increase my forecast if reliable, division-level polling for Derbyshire showed Reform with a clear lead in a plurality of the 64 seats. I would decrease my forecast if polling indicated their support was diffuse or that Labour was the main beneficiary of a decline in Conservative support.",
