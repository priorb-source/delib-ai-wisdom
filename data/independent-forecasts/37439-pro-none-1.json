    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days, with the event window closing on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct, publicly acknowledged phone calls between leaders of the United States and Russia are infrequent, significant diplomatic events. The default state is that no such call occurs in any given one-month period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No urgent international crisis or diplomatic breakthrough occurs that would necessitate a direct, publicly acknowledged call between Trump and Putin within the short one-month window. Diplomatic communications continue through established, lower-level channels, and the political risks associated with a leader-level call prevent one from being scheduled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of a major diplomatic initiative to address the war in Ukraine or another significant global issue, a phone call is scheduled between Trump and Putin. The call takes place within the specified timeframe and is subsequently confirmed by both the Kremlin and official US channels.",
    "rationale": "My forecast places significant weight on the status quo, where leader-to-leader calls between the US and Russia are rare. However, this is balanced against factors specific to the individuals and the geopolitical context. \n\nDonald Trump's documented preference for personal, direct diplomacy, particularly with autocratic leaders like Vladimir Putin, makes such a call more plausible than under a more traditional US president. The ongoing war in Ukraine provides a powerful and persistent reason for direct communication, especially if Trump is actively pursuing a negotiated settlement. The question's background, hinting at a potential call in February 2025, suggests that such contact is a subject of ongoing consideration.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% due to several strong countervailing factors. Firstly, the political risk for Trump would be substantial, with likely criticism from domestic opponents and international allies. Secondly, scheduling and agreeing on an agenda for an officially acknowledged call can be a slow process, and the roughly 30-day window is relatively narrow. Finally, the resolution criteria require public acknowledgement from *both* sides, which raises the bar for the event to occur and be confirmed.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 35% because Trump's personal style and stated policy goals regarding the Ukraine war make him uniquely likely to bypass traditional diplomatic channels for a direct call. The potential for a sudden crisis or a perceived diplomatic opportunity that would prompt a call cannot be discounted.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon hearing credible reports that a call is being planned, or in the event of a major geopolitical development requiring immediate leader-level intervention. I would decrease my forecast if there were a significant public deterioration in US-Russia relations or a major domestic crisis in either country that would consume the leaders' attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
