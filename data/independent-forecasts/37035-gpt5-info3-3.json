  "information": "The current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever activity remains largely confined to rural departments with low tourist traffic; no sustained urban transmission is confirmed in major cities; vaccine access and targeted advisories suffice. CDC keeps Colombia’s Travel Health Notice at Level 2 through and beyond June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp escalation occurs before June 1: evidence of sustained urban transmission in a major tourist hub (e.g., Cartagena, Medellín) and/or significant healthcare strain or vaccine access failures prompts CDC to issue a Level 3 countrywide warning (“Avoid nonessential travel”), and that status remains in place when checked on/after June 1.",
    "rationale": "I interpret resolution per the stated criterion: the forecast resolves Yes if Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice is greater than Level 2 (i.e., Level 3 or higher) when checked on or after June 1, 2025. Currently, Colombia is Level 2 for yellow fever. Historically, CDC reserves Level 3 (“Avoid nonessential travel”) for severe, widespread events (e.g., West Africa Ebola 2014), not for localized sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks where vaccination and targeted precautions are effective. In recent South American yellow fever surges (e.g., Brazil 2016–2018), CDC used Level 2 with expanded vaccination recommendations rather than a Level 3 countrywide warning. The research assistant reports that as of late April 2025, cases are concentrated in rural departments (Tolima, Putumayo), with no verified urban transmission in Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena, and regional totals across the Americas (131 cases, 53 deaths in Q1 2025) do not indicate an explosive, urban epidemic in Colombia. Neighboring countries have issued alerts but not entry bans, suggesting risk is elevated but manageable. With ~5–6 weeks to go, the base-rate and CDC practice favor continuity at Level 2. Tail risks that could push to Level 3 include rapid spread into major urban centers or significant health system strain/vaccine inaccessibility for travelers; both would likely need to be visible and sustained to justify a nationwide Level 3, and then still be in effect by the June 1 check. Why not higher: Level 3 for yellow fever in a single country is rare without clear urban transmission and substantial traveler risk; current epidemiology and policy signals don’t support that. Why not lower: It’s still yellow fever with high CFR, vector seasonality could exacerbate transmission, and a negative surprise (urban clusters, vaccine shortages, or international spread affecting major hubs) could prompt a step-up. Upward updates: confirmed urban transmission in a major city/tourist area; PAHO/WHO emergency framing; marked surge in cases/deaths in Colombia; evidence of vaccine shortages or overwhelmed care. Downward updates: continued rural-only transmission, stable/declining case counts, successful ring vaccination and vector control, CDC/PAHO communications emphasizing targeted precautions rather than broader travel avoidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
