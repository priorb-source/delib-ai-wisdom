  "information": "The SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 28, 2025, DHS/SEVP has revoked Harvard’s certification, so if nothing changes it will not have SEVP certification on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts deny or do not act on Harvard’s emergency request for a TRO/preliminary injunction; or any injunction is stayed on appeal; or DHS maintains the revocation without administrative reversal, leaving Harvard uncertified on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court issues a TRO or preliminary injunction ordering DHS/SEVP to reinstate Harvard’s certification pending litigation, or DHS/SEVP administratively rescinds the revocation and restores certification (even conditionally) on or before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22, 2025, barring enrollment of international students for 2025–26. Roughly 6,800 students are affected. That is the status quo and, if unchanged, yields a No outcome. The question requires certification to be in effect on July 1; a post–July 1 restoration would not count.\n\nWhy a restoration by July 1 is plausible:\n- Legal leverage and timing: Harvard is highly likely to seek an emergency TRO/preliminary injunction. The standards (likelihood of success, irreparable harm, balance of equities, public interest) plausibly favor Harvard: immediate risk to lawful status and degree progress for thousands of students is classic irreparable harm; the public interest typically favors continuity and avoidance of immigration chaos; and Harvard may argue the revocation is arbitrary/capricious or retaliatory under the APA and violates due process. A TRO can be granted within days; a preliminary injunction can follow within weeks, keeping certification in effect by July 1.\n- Forum dynamics: Harvard can file in D. Mass. (First Circuit), where the odds of injunctive relief are better than average for the government. Even if the government appeals, an immediate stay of a district court injunction before July 1 is possible but not guaranteed.\n- Precedent and pressure: In 2020, after Harvard/MIT sued DHS over an SEVP policy affecting online classes, DHS backed down quickly amid legal setbacks and public pressure. While today’s dispute is different and more confrontational, the scale of disruption (27% of the student body) and diplomatic/economic blowback create strong incentives for rapid judicial or administrative relief.\n\nWhy not assume a quick reversal: \n- Inertia and executive resolve: The administration has invested political capital in this sanction and might fight hard in court, invoking campus safety or national security rationales that some judges may credit. That could reduce the likelihood of immediate injunctive relief or prompt an appellate stay.\n- Tailored relief risk: A court could craft partial relief preserving status for current students without fully restoring certification to issue new I-20s. If certification is not actually reinstated to allow enrollment, that may fail the question’s criterion.\n- Time is short: Even sympathetic courts and agencies need time to act; slippage into July is possible.\n\nNet assessment: The status quo is No, but there are strong, fast-moving legal/administrative pathways to Yes. Weighing Harvard’s litigation posture, the high stakes/irreparable harm, plausible APA vulnerabilities, and forum effects against executive resistance and the possibility of appellate stays or narrowed relief, I put the odds modestly above even.\n\nResearch assistant highlights considered: scale of impact (6,800 students, 27% of body), nature of revocation (bars enrollment for 2025–26), and international reactions. These underscore irreparable harm and public-interest factors supporting injunctive relief but do not by themselves guarantee administrative reversal.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast:\n- Harvard files in D. Mass. and promptly secures a TRO restoring certification, or DHS/SEVP announces an administrative stay or reinstatement effective immediately.\n- Indications that DOJ will not seek or cannot obtain an appellate stay before July 1.\n\nWhat would lower my forecast:\n- A district court denies TRO/PI, or an appellate court grants a stay of any injunction.\n- Credible reporting that DHS has compiled a substantial national-security/compliance record and courts are deferring to it, or that any court relief will only preserve status for current students without restoring certification to enroll international students.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
