  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records reported around May 1, 2025, Levar Stoney led the six-candidate field in fundraising, having raised approximately $1.4 million. State Senators Aaron Rouse and Ghazala Hashmi were also among the fundraising leaders. In late May, Carl Eggleston, a former candidate for lieutenant governor and the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council, endorsed Levar Stoney, citing his executive experience. Reports also indicate Stoney has the backing of several Richmond-area elected officials, while Rouse has support from labor and progressive-issue groups.\n\nAn internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "21 days until the Democratic primary on June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Levar Stoney wins the primary based on current polling and fundraising leads",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney maintains his polling lead and converts his fundraising advantage and executive experience into victory. Alternatively, another candidate like Ghazala Hashmi gains momentum among the large undecided bloc and surpasses both Stoney and Rouse.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse successfully mobilizes his labor and progressive base, achieves strong turnout in his Hampton Roads region, and wins over a disproportionate share of the 63% undecided voters. His institutional support from progressive groups translates into effective ground operations in the final weeks, and Northern Virginia voters break his way given the absence of a local candidate.",
    "rationale": "The most recent internal poll from March 2025 shows Stoney leading at 16% versus Rouse's 10%, placing Rouse in second place but trailing by 6 percentage points. However, the extraordinarily high 63% undecided rate means this race remains highly fluid with just three weeks remaining. Stoney holds clear advantages: he leads in fundraising with approximately $1.4 million raised, has executive experience as Richmond mayor, and has secured endorsements from Richmond-area officials and Carl Eggleston. These factors support the status quo of a Stoney victory. That said, Rouse has meaningful assets that prevent dismissing his chances: strong institutional backing from labor and progressive groups, a solid base in Hampton Roads, and respectable fundraising that puts him among the leaders. The six-way race structure means a candidate could win with a relatively low plurality if the undecided vote fragments. Northern Virginia, the largest voting bloc, lacks a local candidate and could be decisive. My forecast is not higher because Rouse is objectively trailing in the only available polling, has less money than Stoney, and there's no evidence of recent momentum shifts in his favor. The forecast is not lower because the massive undecided bloc creates substantial uncertainty, the polling gap is only 6 points in what amounts to a wide-open race, and his institutional support could translate to superior turnout operations. I would revise upward if new polling showed Rouse closing the gap or surging, if major endorsements came his way, or if evidence emerged of strong early voting/turnout in his favor. I would revise downward if new polling showed Stoney or another candidate pulling away, or if Rouse's institutional advantages failed to materialize into visible campaign momentum.",
