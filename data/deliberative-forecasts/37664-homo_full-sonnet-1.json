    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize that 14 months since Claude 3 (March 2024) is significantly longer than previous gaps, suggesting a major release may be 'overdue.' This timeline perspective adds weight to the Neptune reports representing a major numbered release. Forecaster 2's point about the lengthening cadence potentially suggesting 11+ month gaps is interesting but somewhat circular - we're already past 14 months, which would support rather than contradict an imminent release. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point about the narrow 45-day window leaving little margin for typical tech delays, which I underweighted. All three of us converged on the critical naming uncertainty as the core challenge.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward for these reasons: (1) The Neptune reports are remarkably specific - red-team completion on May 18 (just 2 days away) with late May/early June target availability. This level of specificity from credible sources (Cursor-IDE, ZDNet) deserves more weight than I initially gave it. (2) The 14-month gap since Claude 3 is indeed substantial and suggests Anthropic is ready for a major release rather than an incremental update. (3) The Asimov→Claude 3 precedent, combined with the timing, makes it more likely than not that Neptune represents Claude 4 rather than a 3.5 release. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecaster 2's 60% because: (1) The strict naming requirement creates irreducible uncertainty - we simply don't have confirmation that Neptune will be branded Claude 4. (2) The 45-day window is genuinely tight, and even minor delays common in tech releases could push past July 1. (3) Multiple sources describing Claude 4 as coming 'later in 2025' remain somewhat at odds with the May/June Neptune timeline. I estimate roughly 60-65% probability that Neptune is Claude 4, and 80-85% probability it releases on the reported timeline if it is Claude 4, yielding a compound probability around 50-55%.",
