  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' and the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers continue to classify the objective as 'in progress' because: (1) the CPB lawsuit successfully challenges the executive order or remains unresolved, (2) actual federal funding continues to flow given congressional appropriations through September 2027, (3) the maintainers determine that merely signing an executive order without successfully stopping funding doesn't constitute 'completion', or (4) legal and implementation uncertainties prevent them from marking it complete",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers update the status to 'complete' because: (1) they determine the executive order itself constitutes achieving the objective regardless of implementation challenges, (2) the lawsuit is dismissed or funding is actually halted, (3) they see sufficient evidence that the administration has taken definitive action to stop the funding even if money technically still flows due to prior appropriations, or (4) there's clarity that no new funding will be provided",
    "rationale": "The critical observation is that 14 days have passed since the executive order was signed on May 2, yet the tracker still shows 'in progress' as of May 16. This delay suggests the maintainers don't consider the executive order alone sufficient for 'completion' - they appear to be waiting for more concrete implementation or resolution of uncertainties. The CPB's legal challenge complicates matters significantly. The Corporation has funding appropriated through September 2027 by Congress, making it unclear whether the President can unilaterally stop these funds. The CPB argues it's a private nonprofit not subject to executive authority. Additionally, some Republican senators support public broadcasting, suggesting potential congressional pushback. The fact that actual federal dollars continue flowing and will legally continue through 2027 means the objective to 'stop funding' hasn't technically been achieved. Status quo bias strongly favors this remaining 'in progress' - the world changes slowly, bureaucratic processes take time, and legal challenges create uncertainty. However, there's meaningful probability the tracker could be updated to 'complete' if: the maintainers decide the executive action itself counts as achievement regardless of implementation, the legal situation clarifies quickly in the administration's favor, or they interpret any definitive steps toward defunding as completion. The 45-day timeframe is sufficient for these developments but tight given the 14-day delay already observed. My forecast is not higher because the tracker hasn't been updated despite clear opportunity, significant legal and congressional obstacles exist, and funding technically continues. It's not lower because an executive order was signed representing concrete action toward the objective, legal proceedings could resolve quickly, and tracker maintainers might update their assessment at any time based on their interpretation of what constitutes 'complete'. I would update higher with court rulings favoring the order, actual funding cessation, or signals the tracker will be updated. I would update lower with successful court challenges, congressional intervention to protect funding, or clear evidence maintainers require full implementation before marking complete.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
