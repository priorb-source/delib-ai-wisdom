  "information": "US-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 15 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No leader-level trip materializes; any ‘final approval’ for the trade framework happens via phone or at a neutral venue/White House, and Trump remains in the U.S. through June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, working visit to Beijing (or another PRC location such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Macau) is arranged before June 30 so Trump and Xi can ceremonially finalize the trade deal ahead of early-July tariff actions.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Presidential travel to China is typically planned and signaled in advance. With just ~2 weeks left and no credible reporting of an imminent China trip, the status quo strongly favors no visit before July 1.\n- Current context: Per the assistant’s report, U.S.-China talks resumed June 9 (London) and on June 11 Trump claimed a finalized agreement; China called it a ‘framework,’ with final approval from both leaders needed. A tariff pause reportedly expires around July 9, with new tariffs scheduled as early as July 8. This creates some incentive for a leader-level engagement before early July, but an in-person summit in China is not required; phone/virtual approval or a meeting in Washington/neutral ground would suffice and is more logistically straightforward.\n- Logistics and precedent: While surprise trips can occur (e.g., Trump’s 2019 DMZ visit), China visits are high-protocol and usually not arranged on very short notice. If a late-June Beijing signing were likely, we’d expect signals/leaks by now.\n- Why not higher: Lack of public indications, tight timeline, multiple alternatives to an in-China meeting, and Trump’s tendency to host rather than travel for optics.\n- Why not lower: Trump’s appetite for high-visibility dealmaking, the looming tariff timeline that could motivate a photo-op before July, and the possibility of a short, working-level stop in China (including Hong Kong/Macau) to claim a breakthrough.\n- What would raise my forecast: Credible reports of a planned late-June Beijing visit; WH/press pool guidance; Chinese MFA/State Council signaling a leaders’ signing ceremony in China; sightings of U.S. advance teams in Beijing.\n- What would lower my forecast: Confirmation that leaders will approve remotely; scheduling a signing in Washington or a third country; reports that any leaders’ meeting is slated for July (after the cutoff).",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
