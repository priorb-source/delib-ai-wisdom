    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial view: the deal is filed but not active, no price range or roadshow is visible, and multiple reports indicate a pause. They add useful structure on the timing mechanics: from filing a range to listing is typically ~2–3 weeks, so Circle would need to flip to active imminently to make a late-June trade. I also agree with their trigger framework (S‑1/A with a range, roadshow launch, SEC effectiveness as clear bullish signs; explicit postponement or continued silence into early June as bearish). One incremental point they raised that’s worth noting is that a venue change away from NYSE would resolve this market-specific question as No. Overall, their reasoning is consistent, evidence-based, and aligns with my baseline. I don’t see materially new information that would justify a meaningful move from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key facts and base rates are unchanged: Circle updated its S‑1 on April 1, 2025; as of mid‑May the deal is not active, with no range or roadshow, and media point to a pause. To list before July 1, Circle likely needs to file an S‑1/A with a price range and launch a roadshow within the next 1–2 weeks to allow for ~7–10 business days of marketing, SEC effectiveness, pricing, and a first trade in the final week of June. The calendar is tight and includes a mid‑June macro event window (which can raise volatility) and the Juneteenth market holiday, leaving little slack. These factors keep the status quo leaning to No. Countervailing factors keep the probability materially above near‑zero: Circle has a current S‑1, tier‑one underwriters, and can pivot quickly if the window cooperates; crypto sentiment and stablecoin metrics are relatively constructive; and IPO windows can open abruptly. Taken together, I maintain my prior estimate. If we see an S‑1/A with a range or a roadshow launch by late May, I would move up meaningfully; if there’s continued silence past early June or explicit postponement, I would move down sharply.",
