    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the key analytical framework: (1) extremely short 53-day timeframe, (2) low base rate for public company bankruptcy filings, (3) absence of distress signals, and (4) recent SEC filing compliance indicating normal operations. Forecaster 2 and I both arrived at 3%, while Forecaster 3 estimated 8%. The main divergence stems from how much weight to give to uncertainty about unknown financial details versus the strength of the signal from absence of distress indicators. Forecaster 3 makes a valid point that some bankruptcies can occur with limited warning due to sudden triggering events, and that we lack detailed Q4 financial information. However, I find this argument less compelling because: (1) In a 53-day window, truly sudden bankruptcy filings are extremely rare for public companies, (2) The research assistant's inability to find concerning information is itself informative - if GoPro were in acute distress, there would almost certainly be market signals, analyst reports, or credit rating actions, (3) The fact that GoPro filed Q4 results normally with the SEC is a strong positive signal. While I acknowledge legitimate uncertainty, an 8% probability seems to overweight the unknown relative to what we do know.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 3% to 4% to incorporate Forecaster 3's valid points about uncertainty regarding the detailed Q4 financials and the theoretical possibility of sudden triggering events. However, I'm not moving to 8% because the complete absence of any distress signals in a market with robust financial news coverage, analyst attention, and credit rating agencies is highly informative. If GoPro were truly at imminent risk of bankruptcy within 53 days, we would expect to see some evidence: stock price collapse, going concern warnings, credit downgrades, supplier payment issues, or executive departures. The silence is meaningful. The 4% forecast reflects: a very low base rate for the event, the extremely short timeframe, the positive signal from recent SEC compliance, but acknowledges non-zero probability given information limitations and the rare possibility of rapid deterioration.",
