  "information": "The Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Diversity Visa program does not become a major news story or a significant political talking point before July 1, 2025. Donald Trump and Elon Musk continue to focus their social media activity on their primary interests such as election campaigning and border policy (for Trump) and their businesses, AI, and free speech (for Musk). They may tweet about immigration broadly, but do not use the specific phrase \"diversity visa\".",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A newsworthy event specifically related to the Diversity Visa program occurs, such as a prominent court case, a legislative proposal to alter or end the program, or a high-profile incident involving a visa recipient. This event gains traction on conservative media or goes viral on X, prompting either Donald Trump to comment on it as part of his immigration platform or Elon Musk to react to a post about it from an account he follows or sees in his feed.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweeting a specific, technical two-word phrase like \"diversity visa\" within a short timeframe is very low. The status quo, therefore, strongly favors a 'No' outcome. While both individuals are prolific users of X and address immigration, their focus appears to be elsewhere. The research assistant's report indicates their current attention is on other visa programs, such as a proposed 'Gold Card' and the H-1B visa, with no mention of the Diversity Visa. This suggests the topic is not currently top-of-mind for either of them. The resolution window is also very short, closing on July 1, 2025, which reduces the likelihood of a relevant triggering event occurring.  Why the forecast is not lower than 5%: The probability is not zero due to the volatile nature of both individuals and the political landscape. Immigration is a core issue for Donald Trump, and he has attacked this specific program in the past. Elon Musk is highly reactive on X and has been engaging more with political and immigration-related topics. The fact that he follows at least one account that has recently tweeted about the subject provides a plausible, though weak, pathway for the topic to reach his attention. A single viral post or news headline could be sufficient to trigger a tweet. Why the forecast is not higher than 5%: The requirement for the *exact phrase* \"diversity visa\" sets a high bar. Furthermore, there is currently no active, major political or media controversy surrounding the program that would elevate its importance above other pressing immigration issues like border security, which typically dominate their discourse. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see the Diversity Visa program become a subject of mainstream news coverage or a trending topic on X. Conversely, I would lower my forecast as the deadline approaches without any such developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
