  "information": "New tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025. These included a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates on certain categories like automobiles and specific Chinese products, where tariffs reached up to 145%. Following the implementation, early reports in April indicated a 64% collapse in new U.S. import orders. Real-time data showed significant drops in trade activity, including a 35% fall in scheduled container arrivals at the port of Los Angeles, a 30% plunge in U.S.-China imports according to Project 44, and a 40% decline in overall imports reported by Drewry. The S&P Global PMI also indicated a slowdown in U.S. business activity in April. Despite these indicators, the U.S. Treasury collected $16.5 billion in tariff revenue between April 1 and April 28.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases trade data 6-8 weeks after month-end, meaning April 2025 data should be published around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - imports will be significantly lower than April 2024 levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberation Day tariffs cause a substantial decline in import volumes. The early indicators showing 30-40% drops in import activity prove accurate for the full month. Companies that front-loaded imports in March to avoid tariffs leave April with severely depressed volumes. April 2025 imports come in around $200-250 billion, well below the $338.5 billion threshold needed for a Yes outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff implementation, imports exceed April 2024 levels. The early real-time indicators only captured initial shock and exaggerated the decline. Import activity recovers substantially in the latter half of April as supply chains adjust to the new tariff regime. Alternative measurement methodologies or data revisions show imports maintained closer to historical levels, exceeding the $338.5 billion threshold.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly points toward a significant decline in April 2025 imports compared to April 2024. Multiple independent real-time indicators consistently show catastrophic drops: a 64% collapse in new import orders, 35% fall in LA port container arrivals, 30% decline in US-China imports (Project 44), and 40% overall import decline (Drewry). The S&P Global PMI confirms slowing business activity. These indicators are remarkably consistent, all pointing to 30-40%+ declines. If these real-time measures accurately reflect the full month, April 2025 imports would be around $200-240 billion (60-70% of the $338.5B threshold), far below what's needed for a Yes outcome. The $16.5 billion in tariff revenue collected doesn't contradict this, as it could reflect lower volumes at higher rates. The Census Bureau reports imports at customs value (foreign port pricing), so higher tariffs don't artificially inflate reported values. I'm not assigning a lower probability because: (1) real-time indicators may not perfectly capture full-month activity, (2) there could be late-month recovery, (3) measurement timing issues exist, and (4) economic data always contains uncertainty. However, I'm not going higher because multiple independent sources consistently show massive declines, these align with expected impacts of major tariff increases, and there's no countervailing evidence suggesting resilience. The status quo strongly favors imports declining, and dramatic policy changes like these tariffs typically have real effects. For me to update significantly higher, I would need evidence of substantial recovery in late-April activity or indications that early measures were systematically biased downward.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNew tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
