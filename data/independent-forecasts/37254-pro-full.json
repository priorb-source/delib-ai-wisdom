  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (Today is May 1, 2025, and the question resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US has accused Russia of invading Ukraine, but Russia is not currently invading any other country, and the US has not made any new accusations. This status quo continues until the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia's military focus remains entirely on Ukraine. The 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus, mentioned in intelligence reports, either do not occur, are scaled down, or are clearly just training exercises without any cross-border incursions. The US continues its recent diplomatic path of seeking de-escalation, making it less inclined to issue new, strong condemnations. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any new Russian ground invasion of a third country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under the guise of the 'West-2025' military exercises, Russia directs its forces in Belarus to conduct a limited ground incursion into a neighboring country, such as Lithuania, Poland, or a non-NATO state like Moldova. Despite its recent softening of rhetoric at the UN, the US government, faced with a clear and undeniable violation of sovereignty (especially of a NATO ally), publicly denounces the action and formally accuses Russia of an 'invasion'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a low 5%. The primary factors driving this low probability are the extremely short two-month timeframe, the immense strain on the Russian military, and a significant recent shift in US diplomatic posture.\n\nFirst, Russia's military remains heavily committed to the war in Ukraine. Independent and reputable think tanks (RUSI, CSIS) report no significant new troop buildups that would indicate preparations for an invasion of another country. This contradicts Ukrainian warnings and suggests Russia lacks the capacity to open a new front. While Ukrainian intelligence mentioned a 150,000-strong force in Belarus, this is not corroborated by the other sources provided and may be intended to rally international support.\n\nSecond, the provided information indicates a notable change in US policy. In February 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and proposed a softer alternative. This signals a US desire for de-escalation and a negotiated settlement, making them less likely to issue a new, inflammatory 'invasion' accusation unless faced with an unambiguous and significant hostile act, particularly against a NATO ally.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because Russia has a history of miscalculation and aggression (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2014 & 2022). A limited incursion into a non-NATO state like Moldova or a provocation against a Baltic state, while unlikely, cannot be completely ruled out, and the 'West-2025' exercises provide a potential pretext.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers to a new Russian invasion are currently formidable. An attack on a NATO member would risk a direct conflict with the alliance, a risk Putin is unlikely to take while mired in Ukraine. The combination of Russian military constraints and the new US diplomatic posture makes the status quo the most probable outcome over the next two months.\n\nI would raise my forecast significantly if Western intelligence services were to confirm a major Russian troop buildup on the border of a country other than Ukraine. I would lower it if there were further concrete steps towards de-escalation between the US and Russia.",
