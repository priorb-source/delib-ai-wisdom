  "information": "The upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7–9 days (election April 28; preliminary seat tallies likely within 1–2 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "PNM wins a plurality of seats, continuing its narrow edge from 2015 and 2020",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UNC-led opposition (with COP) flips at least two marginal constituencies while holding all of its own, driven by anti-incumbent sentiment on crime and a messy leadership transition within PNM, yielding a 21–20 or better seat edge for UNC",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PNM retains its core map and enough marginals (e.g., the closely fought swing seats from 2015/2020) as voters prioritize continuity or are unconvinced by the UNC’s leadership and coalition, giving PNM a narrow plurality",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2020 PNM won 22–19. Under FPTP with 41 seats, the opposition needs a clean, targeted swing of a few thousand votes across a handful of marginals to reverse the plurality. Absent strong, credible polling, the default (status quo) leans toward continuity: the party that held the plurality twice running typically remains slightly favored. \n\nEvidence tilting away from PNM: According to the research assistant, this is an early election following Keith Rowley’s resignation, with Stuart Young now leading PNM. That’s a disruption of incumbency advantages and can depress organizational cohesion. High crime is a salient issue that usually penalizes incumbents. A former PNM Attorney General (John Jeremie) publicly backing UNC signals elite fissures and could matter at the margins. The UNC has aligned with COP, potentially improving candidate coverage and coordination in close races. If the resignation forced the timing rather than being a strategic call, it weakens the usual \"incumbent knows the timing\" advantage.\n\nEvidence tilting toward PNM: PNM’s recent track record (pluralities in 2015, 2020) and map familiarity provide a structural edge; UNC has to net at least +2 seats while holding everything else. COP’s present-day vote-pulling power is likely limited relative to 2010. UNC’s leader has run and lost twice (2015, 2020), suggesting persistent electability headwinds. Leadership change at PNM can cut both ways—some voters may prefer a fresh face without fully abandoning the governing party. Also, reliable pre-election polls in Trinidad and Tobago are scarce; in low-polling, close FPTP environments, small-c conservative forecasting often gives incumbents a slight edge. \n\nWhy not higher: Crime and anti-incumbency, the leadership transition, and a high-salience endorsement for the opposition all introduce real downside risk for PNM in the very seats that decide the plurality. With only a two-seat swing needed, even modest shifts could flip the outcome.\n\nWhy not lower: The recent electoral baseline (22–19), seat geography, and the opposition’s mixed track record under the same leader argue that PNM retains a genuine path to a narrow plurality. COP’s added value is uncertain, and elite endorsements don’t always translate into votes.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible signs that PNM has locked down key marginals (candidate strength, local polling, strong ground game reports), positive momentum for Young, or fragmentation within the UNC/COP arrangement. \n\nWhat would move me down: Credible constituency-level polling showing UNC leads in swing seats, further high-profile PNM defections/endorsements for UNC, or late-breaking crime/economic headlines blamed on the government boosting anti-incumbent turnout.",
