  "information": "Actions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace. In November 2024, Vietnamese troops also participated in a training program in South Korea for using the K9 howitzer. The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no agreement has been announced yet and the question criteria remain unsatisfied",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue but fail to reach conclusion before July 1, 2025 due to complex financing arrangements, political sensitivities with regional powers like China, or bureaucratic delays in finalizing the contract terms for this unprecedented defense sale between the two countries",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Vietnam and South Korea finalize and publicly announce the agreement for 20 K9 self-propelled howitzers valued at $300 million in the next two months, building on the momentum from Vietnamese troops completing K9 training in November 2024 and years of defense cooperation",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic picture. Strong positive indicators include: (1) Vietnamese troops completed K9 training just 6 months ago in November 2024 - this is highly significant as nations don't typically train personnel on equipment they don't intend to acquire; (2) High-level engagement with the Defense Minister's 2023 visit and manufacturer briefing; (3) Elevated 'comprehensive strategic partnership' status since 2022; (4) Specific deal parameters ($300 million, 20 units) being publicly reported; (5) Prior successful military cooperation with corvette transfers. However, concerning factors include: (1) Despite advanced preparations including training, no announcement has occurred in the 6 months since November 2024; (2) Only 2 months remain until the resolution deadline; (3) This would be South Korea's first defense arms sale to Vietnam, potentially introducing unique political and procedural complexities; (4) Regional geopolitical sensitivities, particularly regarding China's potential reaction, may be causing hesitation. Good forecasting requires weighting the status quo (no announcement yet) heavily, but the training completion is a particularly strong signal that negotiations are advanced. The probability is elevated above 50% due to these concrete progressive steps, but restrained below 65% due to the tight timeline and absence of announcement despite evident readiness. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see: reports of imminent signing ceremonies, official statements indicating final approval stages, or South Korean defense export announcements mentioning Vietnam. To decrease it, I would need: reports of negotiation difficulties, alternative supplier considerations, or statements indicating delays beyond mid-2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nActions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace.

The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
