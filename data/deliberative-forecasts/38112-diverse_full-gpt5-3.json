    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my priors: Brazil’s gatekeeping stance, the unanimity constraint, the April FM communiqué failure, and the short runway all point to low odds. Two useful refinements: (1) positioning the partner framework as an intentional substitute for near-term full expansion, and (2) the observation that the 2023 expansion was telegraphed over a longer period, whereas we lack comparable pre-summit signals now. I find these points persuasive and slightly weight-reducing. I didn’t see new concrete evidence beyond what I’d considered, but the emphasis on signaling dynamics and agenda control strengthens the case for a lower probability.",
    "rationale": "I previously put this at 18%, balancing Brazil’s consolidation stance and intra-BRICS frictions against the bloc’s recent expansion momentum and the political incentive for a summit deliverable. After weighing the other analyses, I’m trimming to 15% mainly because: (a) the partner framework likely functions as the near-term expansion valve, reducing the need to add full members in Rio; (b) we lack the kind of pre-summit consensus signaling that preceded the 2023 enlargement; and (c) the host’s public posture plus the failed April communiqué make last-minute unanimity less plausible on a sensitive file. I’m not lower because Russia/China may still push for a symbolic single-country invite, and the existence of a partner pipeline creates a path if a low-friction candidate emerges and Brazil/India don’t object. Triggers up: credible leaks naming a consensus candidate and signs Brazil softens. Triggers down: explicit statements deferring enlargement or final agendas excluding membership decisions.",
