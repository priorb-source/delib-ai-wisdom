  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by June 15, 2025, which is approximately 5 weeks from today (May 7, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The two leaders have not had a mutually acknowledged phone call since January 2025, and recent official statements from both the US and China indicate there are no immediate plans for a call.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level talks in Geneva on May 10-11 between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng fail to produce a significant breakthrough. The trade war continues without de-escalation, and diplomatic channels remain cool. The rumored 'birthday summit' does not materialize, and as a result, no mutually acknowledged call between Trump and Xi takes place before June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bessent-He Lifeng talks on May 10-11 are unexpectedly successful, creating a clear pathway for de-escalating trade tensions. To build on this momentum and formally launch higher-level negotiations, a phone call between Trump and Xi is scheduled. The call takes place before June 15 and is publicly acknowledged by both the White House and China's Foreign Ministry.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of the current status quo, which is a lack of direct, acknowledged communication between the two leaders. The last confirmed call was in January 2025. Since then, public statements reveal significant distance; President Trump stated on May 5 he has 'no immediate plans' for a call, and China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied Trump's claims of other, more recent conversations. This pattern of denial is critical, as the question requires both sides to acknowledge the call for a 'Yes' resolution. The deep-seated nature of the trade war makes rapid diplomatic breakthroughs requiring head-of-state involvement unlikely in such a short timeframe. The primary factor preventing a lower probability is the scheduled high-level meeting between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng on May 10-11. A surprise positive outcome from this meeting could serve as a catalyst for a leader-level call, especially with the rumored 'birthday summit' for mid-June providing a potential diplomatic target. However, the probability is not higher because the existing diplomatic friction and mutual distrust represent a formidable barrier that is more likely than not to persist through mid-June. I would increase my forecast if the Geneva talks result in a substantive joint statement outlining specific progress. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the Geneva talks end acrimoniously or with no stated progress.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
