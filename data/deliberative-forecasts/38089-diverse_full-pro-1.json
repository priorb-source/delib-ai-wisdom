    "review": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I find their reasoning largely aligns with my own, focusing on the short timeframe and the importance of the current 3-point lead held by Sánchez. Forecaster 2 (67%) reinforces the idea that approval ratings are sticky and the status quo is the most likely outcome. Forecaster 3 (60%) introduces a crucial and compelling argument I had not sufficiently weighed: the risk of 'reversion to the mean.' They correctly point out that historically, Erdoğan has often polled higher than Sánchez, suggesting his current 32% may be a low point from which he is more likely to recover. This single argument provides a strong rationale for why the current 3-point gap might be less stable than it appears. The natural drift over the next month could favor Erdoğan, which significantly increases the downside risk for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3 also rightly noted the minor but real risk that a tie resolves as 'No'.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was anchored on the status quo: with only one month until resolution, Pedro Sánchez's 3-point lead (35% to 32%) is a powerful predictor due to the general inertia of leader approval ratings. This core logic remains sound and is shared by the other forecasters. However, Forecaster 3's point about a potential 'reversion to the mean' for Erdoğan is a significant factor I now believe I underweighting. If Erdoğan's current approval is near a cyclical low for him historically, a modest rebound is more probable than a further decline, especially given the positive consumer confidence data. This makes Sánchez's narrow lead more precarious. I am therefore adjusting my forecast downward to better account for this risk. I am not moving lower than 62% because the timeframe is extremely short, and a full reversal still requires a notable shift that goes against the strong tendency toward inertia. My updated forecast of 62% reflects a continued belief that 'Yes' is the most likely outcome, but with a moderated confidence level that incorporates the non-trivial probability that Erdoğan's rating will recover some ground before the resolution date.",
