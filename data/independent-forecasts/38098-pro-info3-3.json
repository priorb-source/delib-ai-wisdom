  "information": "As of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the current lack of any public campaign preparations, the most likely outcome is that Ralph Norman does not declare his candidacy before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to weigh his options without taking any public steps. Seeing no strategic advantage to an early announcement—which would give incumbent Lindsey Graham a clear target for over a year—he allows the July 1, 2025 deadline to pass, preserving his flexibility to announce later in 2025 or in early 2026.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a bid to generate early momentum and media attention, or perhaps prompted by a significant political misstep by Senator Graham, Ralph Norman launches a surprise campaign in June 2025. This would involve a rapid, behind-the-scenes mobilization that has thus far remained completely undetected.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo, which, as the research assistant's report indicates, shows a complete absence of the typical preparatory activities for a major statewide campaign. As of late May 2025, there are no FEC filings, no exploratory committee, no significant staff hires, and no reports of major donor outreach. Launching a credible US Senate campaign requires substantial groundwork, and with only a month until the deadline, it is highly improbable that such an operation could be initiated from a standing start.\n\nThe official filing period is not until Spring 2026, creating no procedural urgency for an early declaration. In fact, an early announcement is often strategically disadvantageous for a challenger, as it consumes resources and provides the incumbent with a long runway to define and attack their opponent.\n\nMy probability is not lower—for instance, at 1%—because a surprise announcement, while very unlikely, is not impossible in politics. Norman may have a confidential team in place, waiting for a strategic moment to launch. The long-standing speculation about his challenge means the idea is not new.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the lack of any observable evidence is a powerful signal. To justify a higher probability, I would need to see concrete evidence of campaign preparations, such as leaked information about staff hires, the formation of an exploratory committee, or a sudden increase in Norman's public statements critical of Graham.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards with any such news. Conversely, each day that passes in June without any signals of a launch will further decrease the probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
