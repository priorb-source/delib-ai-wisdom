    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election must occur by October 20, 2025, meaning the outcome will be known within approximately 6 months or potentially sooner if an earlier election is called.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a major surge in Quebec while the Bloc Québécois simultaneously collapses, possibly due to Mark Carney's Liberal campaign successfully drawing away sovereigntist voters and creating a three-way split that allows Conservative candidates to win pluralities in many ridings. The Conservatives would need to more than triple their 2021 seat count (from 10) while the Bloc falls from 32 seats to below the Conservative total.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo largely holds where the Bloc Québécois maintains its traditional strength as Quebec's third-largest party. Even if Carney's Liberal surge takes some Bloc seats, the Bloc's established base in francophone regions remains significantly stronger than the Conservative Party's limited Quebec footprint, allowing the Bloc to retain more seats overall.",
    "rationale": "The historical baseline strongly favors a Yes outcome. In 2021, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec compared to just 10 for the Conservatives - a substantial 22-seat margin. For the Conservatives to overtake the Bloc would require an unprecedented swing in Quebec politics. While the articles mention Carney's surge potentially threatening the Bloc, this primarily represents Liberal-Bloc competition rather than Conservative gains. The article noting a Conservative candidate unable to run in Quebec City actually suggests continued Conservative weakness in the province. Quebec's political landscape has traditionally been divided between federalist Liberals and sovereigntist Bloc, with Conservatives holding a narrow base mainly in Quebec City suburbs and a few other pockets. For the Conservatives to win more seats than the Bloc, they would need both a massive Conservative surge AND a Bloc collapse sufficient to overcome a 22-seat gap. Even if the Bloc loses 10-15 seats to the Liberals, they would still likely maintain a lead over the Conservatives unless the Conservatives also gain substantially. The status quo deserves significant weight here given Quebec's distinct political dynamics and the Bloc's entrenched position. My forecast is not higher because Carney's reported surge does create genuine uncertainty and could indicate broader volatility in Quebec politics that might benefit multiple parties. My forecast is not lower because overcoming a 22-seat margin would require historically unprecedented shifts that seem unlikely within months. I would update higher with polling showing the Bloc maintaining strong leads in their traditional ridings, or lower if polling showed Conservatives competitive in 30+ Quebec seats.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
