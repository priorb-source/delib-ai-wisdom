    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core dynamics of this question, with initial forecasts of 75%, 75%, and 76%. We all correctly identified the primary tension between Kalshi's strong operational momentum and business incentives versus the legal/regulatory risks and the strictness of the 'every day' resolution criterion. Forecaster 3 introduced two particularly insightful arguments I hadn't fully weighted: 1) The possibility of geofencing Nevada as a response to an adverse court ruling, which would not trigger a 'No' resolution, significantly mitigating the most prominent short-term legal threat. 2) The explicit framing of the 'compounding operational risk'—how even a high daily success rate (e.g., 99%) results in a lower success rate over 30 days (~74%). This quantifies the fragility we all noted. The geofencing argument is particularly convincing and is the primary driver of my update.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was heavily influenced by the announced speed of the Nevada court case, which I viewed as a significant risk for a nationwide, market-wide injunction or 'voluntary' suspension in June. The other forecasters' analyses, particularly Forecaster 3's point about geofencing, have convinced me that I overestimated the impact of this specific threat. A state-specific restriction is a much more probable outcome of that case than a nationwide shutdown, meaning it poses less of a threat to this question's resolution. This significantly de-risks the short-term outlook. While the compounding operational risk over 30 days is a valid and well-articulated counterpoint, Kalshi's consistent performance for the ~45 days from mid-April to the end of May provides a strong base rate of high daily reliability. With the primary legal threat now appearing less severe, the main remaining risks are a one-off operational failure or a separate, unexpected regulatory action. The balance has tilted more favorably. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 75% to 82%, reflecting a material reduction in the perceived legal risk.",
