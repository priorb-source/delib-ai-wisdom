    "review": "Forecaster 3's division-level analysis raises critical points I underweighted, particularly regarding organizational requirements for FPTP success. The emphasis on ground game, candidate quality, and local canvassing infrastructure is well-taken - Reform UK lacks the established local machinery that Conservatives, Lib Dems, and even Greens have built over decades in Kent. The point about vote splitting actually helping Conservatives is important: if anti-Tory votes fragment across Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform, Conservatives could retain seats with 25-30% vote share. Forecaster 3's skepticism about Electoral Calculus's local MRP is also warranted - we lack transparency about their division-level methodology, and local MRP is indeed unproven compared to national models. The identification of specific Reform-friendly coastal areas (Thanet, Dover, Swale) but noting the need for 20+ wins vs UKIP's historic 17-seat peak effectively illustrates the scale of the challenge. However, I think 9% is slightly too bearish given the genuine political volatility and the fact that councillor defections do indicate some local organizational presence. Forecaster 2's 25% seems too high given the organizational barriers now highlighted. The Electoral Calculus projection, while notable, should be treated as an outlier rather than a central forecast when weighed against FPTP's structural barriers and Reform's organizational limitations.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave insufficient weight to organizational factors in FPTP elections. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that Reform UK would need deep canvassing infrastructure, quality candidates across 20+ divisions, and local name recognition to translate polling into pluralities - capabilities that take years to build. The historical precedent is even more constraining than I initially assessed: UKIP's 17-seat peak came after years of local organizing, yet still fell far short of largest party status. Anti-Conservative vote splitting could paradoxically help the Tories retain seats despite weak overall performance. The Electoral Calculus projection, while not irrelevant, should be heavily discounted as a single, methodologically opaque data point. The convergence of these organizational barriers with FPTP's mechanics makes the 'Yes' scenario significantly less likely than my initial 18%. However, I don't move all the way to 9% because the current political environment is genuinely unprecedented - Reform's national polling is higher than UKIP ever achieved, Conservative collapse is deeper, and the councillor defections signal non-zero local infrastructure. The remaining probability reflects tail risk of extreme political realignment rather than a central forecast.",
