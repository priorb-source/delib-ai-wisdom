    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the ECB-driven disinflation trend and February’s downward revision, arguing that the gradual glide toward 2% makes ≤2.2% plausible. That’s reasonable context and a useful reminder not to over-index on month-to-month noise. However, neither explicitly incorporates the 2025 Easter-in-April timing, which tends to lift April services-related components year-on-year versus 2024 (when Easter was in March). Given the closeness of the 2.2% threshold, that seasonal skew matters. They also treat the downward revision as stronger evidence than I think it is; it nudges the trend but doesn’t by itself imply a sub-2.2% headline in April. Their arguments about sticky services and wage momentum actually cut against a sub-2.2% outcome near term. Overall, their reasoning moderates my confidence but doesn’t overturn the base case.",
    "rationale": "Key points I’m weighing: (1) Recent Euro Area headline prints have been in the mid-2s; dropping to ≤2.2% by April likely requires a notable downside surprise in both goods and energy, while services remains sticky. (2) Easter falls in April 2025 (vs March 2024), typically boosting travel/hospitality/services prices and biasing the April y/y print upward. (3) Energy hasn’t shown a fresh sharp downswing; absent that, the main disinflation push comes from goods, which may not be enough to push headline to ≤2.2% this month. (4) The February downward revision supports ongoing disinflation but is incremental. Balancing these with the peers’ valid point about steady ECB-driven disinflation, I trim my probability a bit to reflect the risk that the glide continues faster than I expect. If preliminary national flashes (Germany/Spain/France) show broad downside surprises in services and energy, I would cut further; conversely, any services firmness consistent with Easter effects would reinforce a >2.2% outcome.",
