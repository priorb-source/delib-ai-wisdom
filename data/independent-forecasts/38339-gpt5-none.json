    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the agreement remains in force, with continued talks or partial performance but no formal cancellation announcement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bulgargaz and BOTAŞ keep negotiating fee relief or restructuring while avoiding a formal termination. Public statements criticize the deal and hint at renegotiation, and there may be payment plans or temporary service adjustments, but neither side issues a clear cancellation notice before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either (1) Bulgargaz/the Bulgarian government announces unilateral termination for cause (e.g., excessive costs, public interest, or alleged contractual breaches), even if BOTAŞ disputes it; or (2) BOTAŞ announces termination due to non-payment/default by Bulgargaz to protect its commercial position.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and inertia: Long-term cross-border energy agreements are legally and diplomatically sticky. They tend to be renegotiated rather than abruptly cancelled, especially within short windows. With only ~25 days left, the default outcome is no cancellation. \n- Legal/financial friction: The 2023 Bulgaria–BOTAŞ access/capacity deal reportedly runs long term and likely includes substantial termination penalties and dispute procedures. Governments typically prefer to renegotiate fees or seek EU-mediated remedies rather than trigger immediate cancellation and litigation.\n- Political context cuts both ways: Bulgarian political actors have publicly criticized the deal and signaled a desire to exit or substantially amend it. That slightly raises the chance of a unilateral announcement. However, caretaker or transitional governments are often cautious about large, litigious moves; and aligning stakeholders (energy ministry, Bulgargaz, treasury, foreign affairs) is non-trivial on a tight timeline.\n- BOTAS incentives: If Bulgargaz is in arrears, BOTAŞ could threaten termination. But suppliers commonly use default notices and service suspension leverage before outright cancellation, to preserve claims and extract payment or concessions. Cancellation forfeits leverage and future revenue.\n- Time constraint: Even if momentum is building (media reports on Bulgargaz financial strain, political statements seeking exit), converting that into a formal cancellation announcement in under a month is still unlikely without clear, imminent triggers.\n- Evidence weighting: The provided articles indicate pressure (Borissov urging exit; Turkish media on Bulgargaz’s debt stress), which nudges probability above a very low base. My research assistant had no additional info, so I lean on general patterns and the short time horizon.\nWhy not higher: No clear, scheduled decision point; legal/penalty hurdles; diplomacy with Turkey; typical preference for renegotiation over cancellation; and very short timeline.\nWhy not lower: Credible reports of financial distress raise the risk of default-driven termination; open political intent to exit increases the chance of a unilateral announcement; and the resolution criteria count a one-sided termination announcement even if disputed.\nWhat would move me upward: Confirmed official default notices; cabinet resolutions authorizing termination; leaks of imminent press conferences; EU findings or conditionality pressing for immediate cancellation; BOTAS signaling an intent to terminate due to non-payment.\nWhat would move me downward: Public confirmation of a standstill/forbearance or interim payment plan; credible reports of ongoing constructive renegotiations; statements from either party affirming continuity pending EU or court reviews.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
