    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling arguments that have identified a key weakness in my analysis. While I correctly emphasized the significance of Kadyrov's May 6th statement, both Forecaster 2 and 3 highlighted something crucial: the complete absence of follow-up reporting over the past 6 days. If a transition were truly imminent within 20 days, we would expect to see additional evidence by now - succession planning reports, Kremlin responses, named successors, or at minimum, follow-up statements. This silence is negative evidence I underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about 'tactical positioning' is particularly insightful - statements about stepping down can serve multiple purposes beyond signaling imminent action. Additionally, both forecasters emphasized that even willing transitions require bureaucratic processes that 'could easily extend beyond May 31' - this is a stronger formulation than my hedging, and the word 'easily' is appropriate given how complex such transitions are in Russia's system. The consensus at 20% appears well-calibrated.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the significance of the May 6th statement relative to the structural barriers to rapid transition. Three critical factors support lowering my forecast: (1) Six days have passed with zero follow-up reporting about transition mechanics, succession planning, or Kremlin coordination - in a true imminent transition, some of this would be visible; (2) The phrase 'wants to step down' suggests desire rather than decided action, and the lack of a specific timeline in the reporting is telling; (3) The 20-day window is not just short but extremely short for the bureaucratic, political, and coordination requirements of replacing the head of a strategically important region that has been led by the same person since 2007. Even in autocratic systems where rapid action is possible, such transitions require preparation we're not seeing evidence of. I maintain that the probability is not negligible (hence staying at 20% rather than going lower) because unexpected developments can occur, but the other forecasters' reasoning about the timeframe and lack of follow-through is persuasive.",
