    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raise important points I underweighted:\n\n1. **The \"one day\" framing**: Both emphasize that we only need ONE day out of 35 where both papers simultaneously omit tariffs. I focused too much on sustained coverage patterns rather than the probability of a single aberrant day.\n\n2. **Mathematical approach**: Forecaster 3's daily probability calculation is rigorous. If each paper has a 3-5% chance of skipping tariffs individually, and they're somewhat correlated, the joint probability is 0.2-0.5% per day. Over 35 days, this compounds to roughly 7-15%.\n\n3. **Weekend/holiday effects**: Today is Memorial Day (May 26), which could be a lighter news day. Weekend editions may have different editorial priorities.\n\n4. **Breaking news potential**: Both note that major unpredictable events could temporarily dominate coverage.\n\nHowever, I remain cautious about going as high as 20% because:\n- The EU tariff deadline (July 9) falls just after the resolution window, meaning June will see intensive coverage as negotiations conclude\n- Multiple 90-day tariff pauses are expiring, requiring policy decisions\n- This remains Trump's signature economic policy\n- The economic impacts ($830/household, job losses) warrant sustained coverage\n\nThe mathematical approach suggests the true probability lies in the 7-17% range. Forecaster 3's 15% seems to strike the right balance between acknowledging current tariff prominence (ruling out 20%+) while properly weighting the 35-day opportunity window and compounding probabilities (ruling out <10%).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my reasoning:\n\n**What I'm adjusting:** I initially underweighted the \"only needs one day out of 35\" aspect. My original analysis focused too heavily on the sustained nature of tariff coverage without properly accounting for the statistical compounding effect of having 35 separate opportunities.\n\n**Mathematical recalibration:** If I estimate each paper has a 2-4% daily probability of omitting tariffs given current salience, and assume moderate correlation between their editorial decisions (since they respond to the same news environment), the joint probability of both omitting tariffs on the same day is approximately 0.2-0.8% per day. Over 35 days, this compounds to roughly 7-24%, with the midpoint around 12-15%.\n\n**What I'm maintaining:** The fundamental challenge remains that tariffs are at peak salience with multiple active storylines: (1) EU tariff deadline July 9 creates intensive June coverage, (2) 90-day pauses expiring soon, (3) Active Vietnam negotiations, (4) Significant economic impacts being reported, (5) This is Trump's central economic policy tool.\n\n**Final assessment:** Forecaster 3's 15% properly balances the mathematical probability over 35 days against the sustained prominence of the topic. I'm updating from 12% to 15% to better account for the compounding probability of multiple opportunities while maintaining appropriate caution given the story's current prominence and upcoming deadlines.",
