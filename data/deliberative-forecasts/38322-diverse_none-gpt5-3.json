    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize how rare sub-54 readings are and that the June preliminary will anchor the plausible final range. I agree that tariffs/inflation headlines heighten downside tail risk, but I find their 25–30% probabilities too high given base rates, the typically small prelim-to-final revisions, and the need to already be near the low-50s for a <54 final to be likely. They don’t provide evidence that current levels are close enough to 54 to justify that much mass in the tail. I also agree with their triggers: a notably weak preliminary (≤56), a hot CPI, and deteriorating labor/gas headlines would raise risk; stabilization or a preliminary ≥60 would lower it.",
    "rationale": "Sub-54 outcomes have historically coincided with severe stress (early 1980s, 2008–09, mid-2022). The Axios-cited plunge suggests vulnerability, but absent evidence that sentiment is already hovering near the mid-50s, crossing below 54 in June would likely require either a very weak preliminary or multiple negative surprises (jobs, CPI, FOMC tone, gas prices/equities) hitting during the survey window. Prelim-to-final revisions are usually small, so the preliminary print will largely set the ceiling/floor for the final. I’m nudging my forecast up from 10% to 15% to reflect peers’ emphasis on heightened downside sensitivity and the possibility that the preliminary could come in soft, but I still view <54 as a low-probability tail given starting-point uncertainty and historical volatility patterns.",
