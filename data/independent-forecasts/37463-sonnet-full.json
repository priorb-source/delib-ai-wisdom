  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.\n\nAnalysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year. In May 2025, both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley raised their target price for Amazon stock to $230.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing is due by approximately May 15, 2025 (45 days after quarter end of March 31, 2025). Since today is May 8, 2025, the outcome should be known within approximately one week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Berkshire maintains approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon (above the 10 million threshold), meaning the question would resolve Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire sells more than 700,000 shares of Amazon during Q1 2025, reducing their holdings to 10 million shares or fewer. This would align with their 10-quarter pattern of being net sellers of equities and their strategic pivot toward holding record cash reserves while focusing new investments on energy and Japanese trading firms.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire either maintains their existing 10.7 million share position or reduces it by fewer than 700,000 shares, keeping them above the 10 million threshold. Alternatively, they could have purchased additional shares, though this seems unlikely given recent patterns.",
    "rationale": "The key insight is that the resolution criteria asks whether Berkshire holds MORE than 10 million shares, not whether they made new purchases. Since Berkshire held 10.7 million shares as of Q4 2024, they have a 700,000-share buffer above the threshold. The critical question is whether they reduced their position by more than this buffer during Q1 2025.\n\nFactors supporting a Yes outcome (>10M shares): Berkshire's historical behavior shows they typically reduce positions gradually rather than dumping them entirely. Even while being net sellers for 10 consecutive quarters, they've maintained various equity positions. Amazon's strong fundamentals via AWS growth and analyst upgrades in May 2025 suggest the position retains strategic value. The 10.7M starting position provides significant cushion.\n\nFactors supporting a No outcome (≤10M shares): The 10-quarter selling pattern is concerning and represents persistent strategic direction. Q1 2025's record $348 billion in cash reserves, absence of stock repurchases, declining operating earnings, and explicitly stated focus on energy and Japanese trading firms (not tech) all suggest continued equity reduction. The leadership transition may also prompt portfolio repositioning.\n\nMy forecast weighs the status quo heavily - Berkshire starting Q1 2025 above the threshold with a buffer. For a No outcome, they would need to actively sell more than 700,000 shares (roughly 6.5% of their position). While their selling trend is clear, completely eliminating positions or selling aggressively is less common than gradual reduction. The probability of maintaining above 10M is elevated by the starting buffer, but reduced by the strong selling pattern and strategic signals. I estimate approximately 65% probability they still hold more than 10 million shares, meaning a Yes resolution.",
