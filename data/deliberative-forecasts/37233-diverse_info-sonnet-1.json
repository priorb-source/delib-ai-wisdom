    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides crucial new evidence I had not fully considered: multiple senior ministers in late 2024 and early 2025 explicitly stating Ouattara WILL be the candidate (not just should consider it), plus the RHDP formally calling him their 'natural candidate.' These are much stronger elite signals than I initially weighted. However, Forecaster 3 also provides important timing context: Ouattara declared in early August 2020 for the October election, meaning roughly 2 months before. If that pattern holds, a June 1 declaration would be unusually early (5+ months out). Forecaster 2's point about weakened opposition is interesting but cuts both ways - it could reduce urgency to declare early OR increase confidence to do so. The key insight is distinguishing between evidence he will eventually run (strong) versus evidence he will declare before this specific June 1 deadline (weaker).",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward based on Forecaster 3's detailed evidence of ministerial statements. The consistent messaging from multiple senior RHDP officials that Ouattara will be the candidate represents stronger commitment than his January ambiguity suggested. However, I'm not moving as high as 42% because the timing precedent argues against a June 1 declaration. The 2020 pattern of declaring 2 months before the October election would place a 2025 declaration in late July or August, well after the June 1 cutoff. With only 33 days remaining and no scheduled May party congress or announcement event reported, the status quo of delay remains moderately likely. The ministerial statements increase the probability he will eventually run, but don't necessarily shift the timing probability for this specific deadline. I'm moving from 30% to 35%, acknowledging stronger intent to run while maintaining that the June 1 cutoff remains strategically premature based on historical patterns.",
