  "information": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5½ weeks (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Colombia remains at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) on CDC’s Travel Health Notices when checked on/after June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever activity persists but remains largely sylvatic and geographically limited; CDC continues advising vaccination and mosquito precautions (Level 2). No additional pathogen triggers a Level 3 advisory, and healthcare capacity in Colombia is not reported as broadly overwhelmed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CDC issues a Warning Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) for Colombia before June 1 due to clear evidence of sustained urban yellow fever transmission in major cities and/or severe system strain (e.g., widespread vaccine shortages, rapidly rising severe cases, hospitals overwhelmed), or due to a separate severe outbreak (e.g., Ebola/Marburg or a novel high-severity respiratory pathogen) that merits Level 3.",
    "rationale": "I’m interpreting resolution per the stated criterion: the outcome is Yes only if CDC’s Travel Health Notice level for Colombia is greater than 2 (i.e., Level 3) when checked on/after June 1, 2025.\n\nBaseline and precedent: The current status is Level 2. CDC historically reserves Level 3 (“Avoid Nonessential Travel”) for rare, high-severity situations where risk cannot be adequately mitigated (e.g., Ebola in West Africa). For yellow fever, even during very large outbreaks (Brazil 2017–18; Nigeria 2019), CDC has typically issued Level 2 notices emphasizing vaccination rather than advising against travel. That historical pattern strongly favors persistence at Level 2, especially given that vaccination effectively mitigates traveler risk.\n\nTimeframe: With only ~5–6 weeks remaining, a jump from Level 2 to Level 3 would require a sharp deterioration: confirmed urban YF transmission in major Colombian cities, serious vaccine access problems, or healthcare system stress rising to a level that justifies avoiding nonessential travel. While media reports highlight economic risk and outbreaks, CDC upgrades to Level 3 are uncommon and conservative.\n\nOther pathogens: Dengue, measles, polio, chikungunya, and malaria surges have historically been handled at Level 1–2 with targeted guidance (vaccination where applicable, bite prevention). Level 3 for these is very unlikely in the short window.\n\nWhy not higher: The combination of CDC’s past practice for yellow fever, the mitigability via vaccination, and the short timeline point to a low likelihood of a Level 3 upgrade.\n\nWhy not lower (near-zero): Non-zero tail risk remains. A sudden confirmation of sustained urban yellow fever transmission with constrained vaccine availability, or an unrelated high-severity outbreak (e.g., filovirus) could trigger a Level 3.\n\nWhat would move me up: WHO/PAHO or Colombian health ministry reports confirming urban YF transmission in major cities; CDC/PAHO warnings of vaccine shortages impacting travelers; hospital overload reports; CDC posting a Level 3 notice draft or social updates indicating imminent escalation.\n\nWhat would move me down: Reports showing containment to sylvatic areas, successful vaccination campaigns, falling case counts, or explicit CDC/PAHO statements that current risk remains addressable with standard precautions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
