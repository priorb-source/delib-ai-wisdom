  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The event covers the period of June 2025, and the outcome will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the historical rarity of pilot UFO reports from Africa in the specified database, the most probable outcome is that no such report for an incident in June 2025 will be filed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes without any pilots flying over the African continent observing an anomalous aerial phenomenon that they choose to report to the National UFO Reporting Center. This outcome would be consistent with the low historical frequency of these specific reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot on a flight path over a country like South Africa or Egypt observes an object with unusual flight characteristics. Encouraged by the growing global discussion on UAPs, they submit a detailed report to NUFORC, which is then published on the organization's website, specifying the sighting occurred in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the historical frequency of relevant reports. The research indicates between four and six pilot reports from Africa were logged by NUFORC over a ten-year period (2015-2024). This establishes a low base rate of 0.4 to 0.6 reports per year. Assuming an even distribution of sightings throughout the year, the probability of a report occurring in any single month is approximately 1/12th of the annual rate, which calculates to roughly 3-5%. The status quo is that these are very rare events, making 'No' the heavily favored outcome. My forecast is not lower because such reports, while infrequent, have occurred before, including a confirmed pilot report from Rwanda in January 2025. This demonstrates that the event is possible and the reporting mechanism is active. My forecast is not higher because there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant increase in the rate of sightings or reporting for this specific region and time frame. While global UAP discourse has increased, its direct impact on a pilot over Africa reporting to a US-based civilian website is speculative and insufficient to overcome the low historical base rate. I would raise my forecast if there were a sudden cluster of credible pilot sightings over Africa in late May, or if major, unusual atmospheric or aerospace events were scheduled for the region in June. I would lower my forecast if there were significant disruptions to air travel over the continent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
