    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have arrived at the identical forecast of 85% for very similar reasons. The core logic shared by all is that industrial production data has strong momentum, the most recent data point (April 2025) was positive, and there is no information about a significant negative economic shock occurring in May 2025. This convergence strengthens the overall conclusion. \n\nForecaster 2's explicit framing of this as a \"nowcast\" is a useful clarification. Forecaster 3 provided valuable detail by highlighting potential sources of month-over-month volatility, such as specific sector shocks (e.g., autos, utilities) and the importance of the base effect from May 2024. These points were implicitly part of my reasoning for not assigning a higher probability, but Forecaster 3 articulated them well. Their arguments are convincing and align perfectly with my own assessment of the risks. There were no new arguments or pieces of evidence that would compel me to move my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other two forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial reasoning rather than challenged it. The strong consensus around the 85% figure, based on the principle of macroeconomic momentum and the absence of contradictory evidence, confirms that this is a well-grounded estimate. The other forecasters' points about sector-specific volatility and base effects are valid and fall squarely within the 15% uncertainty I had already assigned to a 'No' outcome. No new information or compelling counterargument has emerged that would justify altering the probability. Therefore, my confidence in the 85% forecast remains unchanged.",
