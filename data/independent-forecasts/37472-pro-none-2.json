    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India and does not enter Bangladesh. The interim government remains in power and the political and legal environment in Bangladesh remains hostile to her return.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina remains in India past the July 1, 2025 deadline. She continues to issue political statements from exile but considers the personal safety and legal risks of returning to be too high in the short term. The Indian government, prioritizing regional stability, also discourages her from making any move that could destabilize Bangladesh.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a belief that her presence is required to rally her supporters or in response to escalating legal pressure from the interim government, Sheikh Hasina makes a high-risk return to Bangladesh. Alternatively, though less likely in this timeframe, diplomatic negotiations between India and Bangladesh could result in her extradition to face charges.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong status quo that has been in place since Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled to India in August 2024. The fundamental conditions that led to her departure have not changed; in fact, the interim government has been consolidating power and initiating legal action against her and her allies. The timeframe for this question is extremely short, less than two months, making a significant shift in the political landscape of Bangladesh that would allow for her safe return highly improbable. \n\nA return would expose her to immediate arrest and prosecution, as well as significant personal danger from a populace angered by her previous rule. While she has publicly vowed to return, such statements are common political rhetoric from exiled leaders meant to maintain relevance and rally supporters, rather than concrete plans for an imminent return against overwhelming odds.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because ousted leaders can be unpredictable, and a politically motivated, high-risk return, however ill-advised, cannot be entirely ruled out. There is also a small chance of unforeseen political turmoil in Bangladesh that could create a window of opportunity for her.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers to her return are immense. The interim government is stable for now, public sentiment is against her, and her host country, India, has a vested interest in preventing actions that could destabilize its neighbor. A successful extradition process, which is the other path to a 'Yes' resolution, almost certainly could not be completed in under two months. A significant update to my forecast would require credible reports of an imminent collapse of the interim government or a sudden, unexpected agreement between India and Bangladesh regarding her status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
