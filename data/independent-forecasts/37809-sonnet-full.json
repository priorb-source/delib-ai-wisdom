  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Aaron Judge's batting average regresses below .400 as his performance normalizes over the remaining time period",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Judge's BABIP regresses from .481 toward his career average of .344, bringing his batting average down from .401 to somewhere closer to his expected batting average of .362. As the sample size increases over the next 6 weeks and pitchers adjust their approach, natural variance and regression to the mean push him below .400 before July 1. No other player surges to reach .400.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge's hot streak continues through July 1 with sufficient consistency to maintain a .400+ average, or his regression happens slowly enough that he remains just above .400 on the target date. Alternatively, another top hitter like Freeman (.375) or Ohtani (.370) goes on an exceptional run to reach .400.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly argues against this outcome: no MLB player in the last 25+ seasons has maintained a .400+ batting average as late as July 1. The closest recent case was Luis Arraez, who was at .401 on June 23, 2023 but fell to .392 by July 1—just 8 days later. Judge faces 6 weeks (42 days) until the resolution date, providing much more time for regression. The statistical evidence suggests Judge is significantly overperforming: his BABIP of .481 is 137 points above his career average of .344, and his expected batting average (xBA) of .362 is 39 points below his actual .401. These metrics strongly indicate unsustainable performance driven by good fortune on balls in play. As sample size increases from his current ~180 at-bats to ~344 by July 1, maintaining such an extreme outlier becomes progressively harder. However, the probability cannot be extremely low because Judge IS currently at .401, giving him a cushion. He only needs to maintain approximately his current performance level (~.400) over the next 6 weeks, not improve from a lower baseline. Additionally, there are other strong hitters (Freeman at .375, Ohtani at .370) who could potentially surge. My forecast is not higher because the historical precedent is overwhelming and the statistical evidence of overperformance is clear. It's not lower because of Judge's current position at .401 and the relatively short timeframe until resolution. I would update higher if Judge maintains .410+ through early June or if multiple players remain above .380. I would update lower if Judge falls below .380 in the next few weeks.",
