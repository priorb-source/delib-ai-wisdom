    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement; the Scottish Government continues to emphasize domestic governance and avoids scheduling a referendum without UK consent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "John Swinney’s minority SNP government prioritizes competence and stability, with no legislative or strategic push to name a referendum date; no credible coalition path or legal cover emerges, and July 1 passes without an official date being set.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing a sudden and sustained surge in Yes support and internal pressure from pro-independence allies, the First Minister or Scottish Government announces a specific referendum date—possibly framed as a consultative plebiscite—even if it invites immediate legal challenge from the UK government.",
    "rationale": "- Political context: The SNP now leads a minority government under John Swinney after a turbulent 2024 and a weak showing at the 2024 UK general election. Swinney has signaled a focus on competence and stability rather than immediate constitutional confrontation. That makes a unilateral date announcement in the next two months unlikely.  \n- Institutional/strategic hurdles: The UK Supreme Court has already ruled Holyrood lacks competence to legislate for an independence referendum without Westminster’s consent. While this market treats broader legality as irrelevant for resolution, that ruling still deters the Scottish Government from scheduling a vote it cannot deliver.  \n- Precedent: Nicola Sturgeon announced an October 2023 date in 2022 to force legal clarity; current leadership has taken a more cautious tack post-2024.  \n- Polls: Even if some recent polls show an edge for Yes, the trend has not created a clear and sustained pro-independence supermajority that would impel the government to take a high-risk step within weeks.  \n- Time constraint: With roughly two months left, the window for a surprise announcement is very narrow absent a major political shock or strategic pivot.  \nWhy not higher: The combination of minority status, recent electoral setbacks, leadership caution, and legal headwinds makes a pre–July 1 announcement very improbable.  \nWhy not lower: A non-zero chance remains that the Scottish Government could announce a consultative or symbolic date to galvanize supporters or respond to a sudden, sustained polling surge; the resolution criteria would count such an announcement regardless of UK legality.  \nWhat would move me up: Multiple consecutive reputable polls showing 55–60%+ Yes; explicit Scottish Government messaging that a date will be named; tabling of a referendum bill with a specified date; SNP/Green alignment around a near-term timetable.  \nWhat would move me down: Clear public statements from the First Minister ruling out any date announcement this term; further SNP instability; the calendar running down without any preparatory signals.  \nResearch assistant input: None beyond the prompt; no new information provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
