  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge’s BABIP regresses toward his career norm, and he bats ~.340–.370 over the next six weeks, pulling his average below .400 by July 1. No other contender (e.g., Freeman, Ohtani) closes the gap from the mid-.300s to .400 in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge sustains an elite run (.390–.420 over the next ~160 AB) and remains ≥.400 on July 1 while still appearing on ESPN’s default stats page (likely qualified hitters). Alternatively, a high-contact hitter (e.g., Arraez-type profile) surges into the .390s by mid-June and stays hot enough to be ≥.400 on July 1.",
    "rationale": "Summary of current picture (per assistant’s report): As of May 20, 2025, Aaron Judge is ~.401 after 46 games, with a very high .481 BABIP (career .344) and xBA ≈ .362. Freddie Freeman is ~.375; Shohei Ohtani reported ~.370. Historically, no MLB player in the last 25 seasons has been ≥.400 on July 1; e.g., Luis Arraez was .401 on June 23, 2023 but fell to .392 by July 1.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Base rate: Having anyone ≥.400 on July 1 is exceedingly rare (zero in the past 25 seasons), pushing the status quo toward “No.”\n- Judge-specific regression: His BABIP (.481) is unsustainably high versus career (.344), and his xBA (~.362) suggests forward-looking batting at roughly .35–.37 rather than .40+. From May 20 to July 1 he’ll likely accumulate ~150–180 AB. To remain ≥.400 overall by July 1, he’ll need to hit about .399–.401 over that span (because he currently sits right around .400 and will add a similar number of AB as he already has). If his true talent over the next six weeks is ~.35–.36, the chance he hits ~.400 across ~160 AB is modest (roughly 10–20% for Judge alone at p=0.36; closer to ~9–15% if p=0.35–0.36). \n- Other contenders: Players in the mid-.300s (Freeman, Ohtani) would need an extraordinary surge to reach and hold .400 by July 1; their individual probabilities are small, but they add a little mass in aggregate.\n- ESPN page/qualification: The resolution cites ESPN’s stats page. ESPN’s default leaderboards typically show qualified hitters (3.1 PA per team game). My forecast assumes this convention. If the question instead counts any player shown anywhere on ESPN (including non-qualified hitters), the probability would be much higher because small-sample players over .400 are common by July 1. Under the qualified-hitter assumption, missing time could also hurt a .400 candidate by making him non-qualified on that date.\n\nWhy not higher: Extreme BABIP regression risk, historically low base rate through July 1, and the difficulty of sustaining ~.400 over a large block of ABs. Why not lower: Judge is already ~.400, has elite contact quality (xBA ~.362), and needs only six more weeks of very strong performance—not an entire season. Multiple shots (Judge plus a few long-shot candidates) also nudge the probability above the historical base rate.\n\nWhat would move my forecast up: Judge at ≥.395 on June 7–10 with xBA and BABIP still elevated; another hitter climbs into the .390s by mid-June; clarity that non-qualified players count on ESPN’s page. What would move it down: Judge slips to ≤.380 by early June; his BABIP normalizes sharply; he falls off the qualified pace by July 1; no other hitter above ~.370 by mid-June.",
