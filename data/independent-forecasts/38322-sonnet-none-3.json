    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The final report is expected to be released on Friday, June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the June 2025 Consumer Sentiment reading will likely be at or above 54.0. While the background suggests recent deterioration in sentiment due to tariff concerns, readings below 54.0 are historically extremely rare, occurring only during the most severe economic crises.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or recovers modestly from the May 2025 plunge mentioned in the background. Markets adjust to tariff policies, inflation expectations moderate, or government/Federal Reserve actions restore some confidence. The June final reading comes in at 54.0 or higher, consistent with historical patterns where sentiment finds a floor even during difficult periods.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment continues its sharp decline through June. Tariff impacts worsen beyond May levels, triggering recession fears or actual economic contraction. Additional negative shocks occur - perhaps job losses accelerate, financial markets decline sharply, or policy uncertainty intensifies. The June reading falls below 54.0, reaching levels seen only in the worst moments of economic history.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 54.0 is exceptionally low by historical standards. During the Great Recession, the index bottomed around 55.8 in November 2008. Readings below 54.0 would represent truly catastrophic consumer confidence levels. While the Axios article reference suggests recent deterioration due to tariffs in May 2025, I lack specific data on the magnitude of that decline. Good forecasting practice suggests weighting the status quo heavily - after an initial shock, sentiment typically stabilizes rather than continuing to plummet indefinitely. The preliminary June reading (usually released mid-month) may have already provided some indication of trajectory. Without evidence of complete economic collapse or unprecedented crisis, maintaining readings below 54.0 for an entire month would be unusual. My forecast is not higher because the question background explicitly references a sentiment plunge, suggesting genuine recent weakness. My forecast is not lower because I'm applying appropriate status quo bias and recognizing that sub-54.0 readings represent extreme tail events. I would update higher if I learned the preliminary June reading was already above 55.0, or if positive economic news emerged. I would update lower if I learned May fell below 50.0 or if major negative economic developments occurred in early-to-mid June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
