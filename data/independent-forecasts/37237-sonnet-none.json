    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases trade data about 40-45 days after the end of the reporting month, so the April 2025 data should be published in early to mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - imports would likely decline or remain flat compared to April 2024",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs have been implemented and are having their intended effect of reducing imports. US companies have reduced purchases of foreign goods due to higher tariff-inclusive prices, and some have shifted to domestic suppliers. The tariffs may have also triggered retaliatory measures from trading partners, further disrupting trade flows. Total imports for April 2025 come in below the $338.483 billion April 2024 baseline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff announcements, importers engaged in significant 'front-loading' behavior in April 2025, rushing to bring in goods before higher tariffs took full effect. Additionally, inflation has pushed up the nominal dollar value of imports even if physical volumes remained stable. The combination of anticipatory importing and price increases pushes total April 2025 imports above the April 2024 level of $338.483 billion.",
    "rationale": "The baseline is $338.483 billion in imports for April 2024. The question background highlights Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs as the key contextual factor. Major new tariffs typically reduce imports by making foreign goods more expensive and encouraging domestic substitution. However, the timing of tariff implementation is critical. If tariffs were announced in advance with future implementation dates, companies often front-load imports to avoid higher costs, which could temporarily boost import levels. Without specific information about when these tariffs were announced versus implemented, I must weigh competing factors. Arguments for lower probability: (1) The fundamental effect of tariffs is to reduce imports once implemented; (2) The question specifically frames this in the context of major tariff policy, suggesting the forecaster should expect effects; (3) Status quo bias suggests maintaining similar import levels absent strong countervailing factors. Arguments for higher probability: (1) Advance notice of tariffs often triggers front-loading behavior that temporarily increases imports; (2) Nominal import values can rise due to inflation even if volumes decline; (3) Economic growth between 2024-2025 might naturally drive higher imports. Given the significant policy change mentioned and the typical lag between tariff announcement and full implementation effects, I estimate a 40% probability. This is below 50% because the status quo expectation with major new tariffs is for imports to decline. However, it's not dramatically lower because front-loading effects and inflation could plausibly push nominal import values higher. I would update higher with evidence of: substantial front-loading activity in March-April 2025, tariffs not taking effect until May 2025 or later, or strong economic growth. I would update lower with evidence of: tariffs implemented in early 2025 or before, weak economic conditions, or significant supply chain disruptions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
