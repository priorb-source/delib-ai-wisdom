  "information": "There are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks. The FATF June 2025 Plenary meeting will occur in June, and outcomes are typically announced shortly after the meeting concludes.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No changes to the grey list - all 25 current jurisdictions remain on the list and no new jurisdictions are added.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF June 2025 Plenary convenes and reviews various jurisdictions, but ultimately decides not to add or remove any countries from the 'Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring' list. All current grey-listed jurisdictions remain on the list pending further review at future plenaries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction experiences a change in status. Most likely, the British Virgin Islands is added to the grey list following its failed mutual evaluation and expired grace period, with the UK not blocking the listing. Alternatively or additionally, one of the current 25 jurisdictions could be removed after demonstrating sufficient compliance improvements.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant provides specific, actionable intelligence about the British Virgin Islands being a strong candidate for addition: major gaps found in mutual-evaluation follow-up, grace period expired in February 2025, and UK signaling non-opposition. This represents a concrete near-term catalyst for change. Historical patterns also favor a YES outcome - FATF meets three times annually and regularly makes changes at these meetings. The most recent changes occurred just three months ago in February 2025 (Laos and Nepal added, Philippines removed), demonstrating an active review process. With 25 jurisdictions currently on the list, there are also multiple potential candidates for removal if they've demonstrated sufficient progress. The Pakistan re-listing mentioned is more speculative and depends on political factors, so I weight it less heavily. My forecast is not higher (85-90%) because international processes involve diplomatic complexity and timing uncertainties - even strong candidates like BVI could face delays for political or procedural reasons. The forecast is not lower (50-60%) because the BVI case is particularly compelling with specific details about expired deadlines and political support for listing, and the historical baseline probability of changes at FATF plenaries appears elevated given recent activity. I would revise upward if additional credible reports confirm BVI listing is imminent or if other strong candidates emerge. I would revise downward if reporting suggests BVI received another extension or if the June plenary agenda appears unusually light.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
