  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. June 2025 will complete at the end of the month, and the outcome will be determined when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the number will exceed 400. The current 2025 pattern shows all four months (January through April) have exceeded 400 reports, with a monthly average of 517.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 experiences an unusual and significant drop in reporting activity, falling below 400 reports. This could occur if there's a major competing news event that dominates public attention, technical issues with the NUFORC reporting system, or an unexpected seasonal anomaly that reduces both actual sightings and reporting behavior.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 continues the established 2025 pattern, maintaining or exceeding the year-to-date monthly average of 517 reports. Summer weather brings more people outdoors, potentially increasing both sightings and reports. The ongoing public interest in UAP topics sustained through early 2025 continues into June.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. Historical data shows June exceeded 400 reports in 2020 (470), 2021 (407), and 2022 (603). More importantly, recent trends are decisive: all months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports, all months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports, and all four months in 2025 have exceeded 400 with an average of 517. This 2025 average is 29% above the 400 threshold, providing substantial buffer. The consistency is particularly notable - every single month in the past 2.3 years has cleared the bar. For June to fail to exceed 400 would require a dramatic departure from an established pattern. Counter-considerations include: we haven't yet seen May 2025 data, unforeseen events could impact reporting, and some inherent uncertainty always exists. However, given the robustness of the trend and the relatively low threshold compared to recent averages, the probability of exceeding 400 is high. I'm not going higher (to 95%+) because we lack complete information about very recent trends and should maintain modest uncertainty. I'm not going lower because the evidence is overwhelming and consistent across multiple years and months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
