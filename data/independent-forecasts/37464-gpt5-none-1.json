    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page on/after June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS’s effectiveness checks and documentation aren’t finished or posted by late May, so the status remains Active through June 1 and is only changed to Closed sometime afterward.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 and FSIS complete effectiveness checks for the limited vending-machine distribution, paperwork is in order, and FSIS updates the recall status to Closed before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The recall was posted Feb 24, 2025. As of today (May 8), it’s been active ~10.5 weeks and is still Active (the prompt confirms criteria not yet satisfied). There are ~3.5 weeks left for a status change.\n- Typical closure timing: FSIS recalls commonly close within roughly 1–4 months, depending on scope and documentation. The 97-day window (Feb 24–Jun 1) is toward the upper end of the common range but still normal.\n- Scope factors: This recall involves ready-to-eat Chicken Caesar wraps in Washington vending machines. That suggests a relatively constrained distribution chain (likely a small number of consignees/operators) and a short shelf-life product—both favor faster closure once FSIS verifies effectiveness. Short shelf life means little product should remain in commerce by now, simplifying verification.\n- Offsetting considerations: It’s still Active after ~73 days, implying either ongoing verification or posting lag. Small firms sometimes take longer to furnish complete documentation. Allergen recalls can be treated with greater scrutiny. Also, agency posting cadence and a late-May holiday could introduce timing delays.\n- Weighing status quo: If nothing changes, it resolves No. But given the elapsed time and limited scope, the hazard rate for closure in the next 3.5 weeks seems meaningful. I modestly overweight the status quo but still see slightly-better-than-even odds for closure by June 1.\n- Why not higher? We lack confirmation that effectiveness checks are near completion; some FSIS recalls linger past three months even when scope is small. Agency update timing can slip past arbitrary calendar cutoffs.\n- Why not lower? The product’s perishability and localized vending distribution make verification relatively tractable; many similar misbranding/undeclared-allergen recalls close within 2–3 months.\n- What would move me up: Any FSIS update indicating most effectiveness checks completed, a firm press release noting closure progress, or observation that comparable 2025 recalls with similar scope are closing around the 10–12 week mark.\n- What would move me down: Signs of recall expansion, difficulties contacting consignees, enforcement actions, or a pattern of 2025 FSIS recalls taking >4 months to close.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available; forecast relies on general FSIS timelines, product characteristics, and current status noted in the prompt.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
