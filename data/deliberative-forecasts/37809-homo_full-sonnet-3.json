    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably (18%, 20%, 22%), suggesting strong agreement on the core factors. The other forecasters didn't introduce fundamentally new evidence, but they did provide valuable mathematical projections that help quantify the regression scenario. Forecaster 2's calculation that Judge would finish around .384 if hitting at his xBA over 35 more games, and Forecaster 3's projection of .389 if hitting .375, both support the regression thesis but also show he wouldn't fall catastrophically far. These calculations reinforce that while regression is likely, the 42-day window is genuinely shorter than I initially weighted. All forecasters correctly identified the same key factors: Judge's minimal cushion, extreme BABIP regression indicators, stark historical precedent, and the Arraez cautionary tale. The convergence around 18-22% appears well-calibrated - high enough to account for Judge's current position and the manageable timeframe, but low enough to respect the overwhelming historical and statistical evidence against maintaining .400.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I believe my initial 18% was slightly too conservative. The other forecasters' mathematical projections clarify that even with expected regression, Judge wouldn't necessarily crater below .400 immediately - gradual decline to .384-.389 is more realistic. The 42-day window is genuinely significant: it's roughly 40-45 games, not a full season. While the historical precedent (0/25 years) and regression indicators remain powerful, the combination of: (1) Judge starting with a 1-point cushion, (2) the relatively short timeframe where variance matters more, (3) his elite talent baseline, and (4) backup candidates in Freeman (.375) and Ohtani (.370) collectively warrant a slightly higher probability than 18%. However, I'm not moving to 22% because the regression indicators are so overwhelming and the historical failure rate is perfect (0%). The consensus around 19-20% appropriately balances the favorable current position against the strong forces of regression and historical precedent.",
