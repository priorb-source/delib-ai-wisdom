    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 present sharply divergent views (30% vs 58%), highlighting the critical uncertainty around tariff timing and impact. Forecaster 2 assumes a 'sweeping new tariff regime' already implemented in early 2025 with widespread retaliation, arguing this will overwhelm the 3-3.5% inflation cushion. Forecaster 3 focuses more on baseline fundamentals—services recovery, petroleum price support, aircraft deliveries—and treats tariffs as background 'policy uncertainty' rather than an active shock. Forecaster 3 raises important factors I underweighted: the multi-year services export recovery (travel, business services) which are less tariff-vulnerable, and specific commodity exports (petroleum, aircraft) that can provide lumpy support. The dollar strength point is also valid as an additional headwind. However, Forecaster 2's framework of weighing volume decline vs. nominal inflation is clearer, and I find their concern about retaliatory tariffs compelling given the question's explicit context. The key disagreement centers on whether tariffs are an active, material force by April 2025 (F2's view) or more of a marginal uncertainty (F3's view). Historical precedent from 2018-2019 tensions suggests US exports didn't collapse even during trade disputes—they grew more slowly but often maintained nominal year-over-year growth. This supports F3's perspective that baseline supports matter significantly.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was somewhat too pessimistic about baseline growth drivers. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that services exports have momentum, petroleum prices provide support, and even modest inflation (2-3%) creates a meaningful cushion when the threshold is so close to the baseline. Even if goods exports face headwinds, services (which now represent about 35% of total exports) are less vulnerable to tariff retaliation. However, I still believe Forecaster 3 underweights the tariff risk signal embedded in the question context. The explicit reference to 'liberation day tariffs' suggests this is material, not merely background noise. Forecaster 2's 30% seems too bearish—historical trade tensions show nominal exports often grow despite volume pressures, and a 3-4% decline in nominal terms would require severe disruption. The truth likely lies between: tariffs create meaningful drag, but services recovery, commodity prices, and inflation provide substantial offsets. I'm revising upward modestly from 42% to 46%, acknowledging F3's valid points about baseline supports while maintaining that tariff risks keep probability below 50%. The outcome remains highly uncertain pending actual data on early 2025 export trends and retaliation patterns.",
