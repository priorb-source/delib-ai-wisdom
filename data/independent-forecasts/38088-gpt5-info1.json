  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th spot on July 1 is held by a non‑US billionaire (e.g., Vladimir Potanin or another non‑US name rotating into that band). Market and FX moves through June leave the mix around ranks 240–260 dominated by non‑US individuals, so the specific person at #250 is not from the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A US billionaire who currently hovers around ranks ~240–260 lands exactly at #250 on July 1. This could be helped by modest US equity outperformance or USD strength versus other currencies in June, nudging US fortunes up relative to non‑US peers exactly at the median cut.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: On Apr 30 the #250 was Giancarlo Devasini (Italy). On May 29 it was Vladimir Potanin (Russia). So the latest two snapshots are non‑US. That points to a current status‑quo of “No.”\n- Base rates/composition: The US is the single largest source of billionaires and likely holds a large share of the Bloomberg 500 (roughly on the order of ~35–40%). However, US representation skews especially heavy in the very top ranks. Around the mid‑list (near #250), the mix is more globally diversified (Europe, China, India, Russia, etc.), so the US share at that exact neighborhood is plausibly somewhat below the overall top‑500 US share.\n- Volatility at rank ~250: Day‑to‑day movements in equity markets, FX, and commodity prices can cause frequent small re‑orderings near the #250 cut. That means the identity at #250 on any given day is effectively drawn from a small pool of names hovering around that threshold. The chance that #250 is American on a random day should be close to the US share within that small pool rather than the entire list. Given the last two snapshots were non‑US, I put extra weight on a slightly sub‑even chance for the US here.\n- Why not higher: Two recent reference points show non‑US at #250; historically the mid‑ranks are internationally diverse; and only ~33 days remain, making a structural shift toward US dominance at exactly #250 less likely.\n- Why not lower: The US still has the largest country share overall; small market or FX tilts (especially USD strength) can nudge US names up relative to non‑US, making a US occupant at #250 on July 1 quite plausible.\n- What would move me up: Observing through June that #250 is frequently a US name; signs of sustained US market outperformance vs. ex‑US or a stronger USD; news that several US individuals are clustering tightly around ranks 245–255.\n- What would move me down: Continued dominance of non‑US names at #250 throughout June; weaker USD or stronger ex‑US markets; evidence that the immediate pool around #250 is mostly non‑US industrialists/financiers with stable valuations.\n\nSummary of assistant’s info used: As of Apr 30 #250 was Italy (Devasini); as of May 29 #250 was Russia (Potanin). These snapshots anchor the current, non‑US status quo and inform a sub‑50% estimate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
