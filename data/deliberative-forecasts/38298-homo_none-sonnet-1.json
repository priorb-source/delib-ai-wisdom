    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points that warrant consideration. Forecaster 2's explicit invocation of the 'status quo principle' - that outlier records generally hold unless there's strong evidence otherwise - is a valuable framing I implicitly considered but didn't emphasize enough. Both forecasters also stress that May 2024 likely set its record during peak El Niño conditions, making it an especially difficult bar to surpass. This is an important specification that strengthens the case for a lower probability. The narrow clustering of our forecasts (35-40%) suggests we're all working from similar analytical frameworks and reaching reasonable agreement on the fundamental factors: the exceptional warmth of 2023-2024, the ENSO transition timing, the lack of preliminary May 2025 data, and the tension between long-term warming trends and natural variability. Forecaster 3's careful balance of base rate reasoning is particularly well-structured. I find their arguments convincing, though not dramatically different from my own analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 40% forecast was slightly optimistic. While my reasoning about the underlying warming trend and momentum from 2023-2024 remains valid, I should weight the status quo principle more heavily. May 2024 almost certainly set a very high benchmark during favorable El Niño conditions, and the typical ENSO transition by May 2025 means we're comparing against an outlier record without the same favorable conditions. The absence of preliminary data suggesting exceptional May 2025 warmth should push me toward greater caution. However, I don't think a dramatic revision is warranted - the warming trend is real, and there remains meaningful probability that favorable variability could still produce a record. The 35-40% range appears to be the appropriate probability space for this question, and adjusting to 38% - aligning with Forecaster 3's well-reasoned middle position - reflects appropriate deference to the consensus while maintaining that record-breaking remains a substantial possibility rather than a remote one.",
