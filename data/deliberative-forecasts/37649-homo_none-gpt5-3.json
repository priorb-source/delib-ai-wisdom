    "review": "Both forecasters use similar base-rate reasoning and timing. New/clarified points I found useful: the explicit 3–9 (or 3–12) month window post-licensing for many African rollouts; the notion that Starlink may batch country flips late in a quarter; and the reminder that only any portion of Chad needs to flip to “Available” to resolve Yes. Forecaster 2’s 60% leans heavily on base rates and Q2 batch potential; Forecaster 3’s 42% weights status-quo inertia and small-market frictions more. I find F3’s caution more convincing given the short window and lack of visible pre-launch signals, though F2’s point about the timing (7+ months post-license by late June) nudges me slightly upward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "We have ~46 days left. License was reportedly granted in Nov 2024, putting late June at ~7.5 months post-license—within a common activation window historically. Tailwinds: ISL reduces gateway dependence; Starlink’s recent Africa cadence; and a potential end-of-Q2 batch update could include Chad. Headwinds: Chad’s small market and logistics (import/type approvals, taxes, distribution) and history of internet controls increase odds of slippage; absence of public indicators (ETA on map, distributor activity, shipments) this close to the cutoff favors status-quo persistence. Net: modest upward adjustment from my prior 42% to 45% to reflect that we’re squarely in the typical rollout window and a Q2 batch is plausible, but I remain slightly below even odds due to the short remaining window and lack of corroborating signals specific to Chad.",
