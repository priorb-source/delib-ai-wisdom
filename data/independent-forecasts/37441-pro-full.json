  "information": "As of early May 2025, the USD/EUR exchange rate is approximately 0.884, requiring a 9.5% depreciation of the US dollar to fall below the 0.80 EUR threshold. Economic data from the United States indicated a contraction of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, though the economy added 177,000 jobs in April. In the Eurozone, consumer inflation rose by 2.2% in April, which was higher than expected. The Eurozone's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had previously risen to 2.5% year-over-year in January, the highest rate since July 2024. Market expectations for the US Federal Reserve include a 33-37% probability of an interest rate cut by July 2025.\n\nThe EUR/USD pair is trading within a range of approximately 1.12 to 1.15. Technical analysis suggests that a break above 1.15 could lead to further gains, while falling below key support levels could signal a bearish cycle. Some analysts have set technical targets for the EUR/USD pair to reach 1.25 (equivalent to 0.80 USD/EUR) by late 2025. Historically, May has been a weak month for the EUR/USD pair, with an average negative return of 0.62% over the past 50 years. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index showed the dollar was down 7% for the year-to-date as of May 2025.\n\nUS trade policy has been a factor influencing the dollar's value. In February 2025, the US administration implemented a 10% tariff on certain Chinese goods, and the possibility of tariffs on European Union products remains. The US President has mentioned potential 25% tariffs on EU imports, including automobiles. In a separate policy development, the German government announced a 500 billion euro off-budget defense infrastructure fund, which led to a 1.60% appreciation of the euro on the day of the announcement. In January 2025, Bank of America released a forecast projecting a stronger US dollar by the end of 2025, with a central forecast for the EUR/USD rate at 1.05.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The resolution window is from May 12, 2025, to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US dollar will remain valued above 0.80 EUR.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US economy avoids a major negative shock, the Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady, and geopolitical tensions do not escalate significantly. The USD/EUR exchange rate continues to fluctuate within its recent range, not experiencing the nearly 10% depreciation required to meet the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A confluence of negative events, such as a sharp downturn in US economic data forcing the Federal Reserve into an unexpected interest rate cut, coupled with the implementation of steep US tariffs on EU goods, causes a rapid loss of confidence in the US dollar. This prompts a flight of capital and pushes the exchange rate below the 0.80 EUR threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the significant magnitude of the currency movement required in a very short timeframe. As of early May 2025, the USD is at approximately 0.884 EUR, requiring a depreciation of about 9.5% to fall below the 0.80 EUR threshold before July 1. Such a large move in a major currency pair in under two months is a low-probability event, making 'No' the strong status-quo outcome. Supporting this view, market pricing indicates only a 33-37% chance of a Fed rate cut by July, and a Bank of America forecast projects a stronger, not weaker, dollar by year-end. However, my forecast is not lower than 18% because there are significant factors creating downside risk for the dollar. The US economy contracted in Q1 2025, the Bloomberg Dollar Index is already down 7% year-to-date, and unexpectedly high Eurozone inflation supports a stronger Euro. The primary risk factor that could trigger a 'Yes' outcome is a severe negative shock, such as the threatened tariffs on the EU materializing, which could introduce extreme volatility. My 18% probability reflects that while a dollar crash of this magnitude is unlikely, plausible catalysts make it a non-trivial tail risk. I would increase my forecast with clear signals of an imminent Fed rate cut or an escalating US-EU trade war. I would decrease it if US economic data rebounds strongly or the European Central Bank signals a more dovish policy.",
