    "review": "The two other forecasters present starkly conflicting views, with a 50-point gap between their forecasts (70% vs. 20%). The core of this disagreement lies in their interpretation of the resolution criteria, specifically the clause: \"A protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\"\n\nForecaster 3 interprets this very strictly, arguing it disqualifies any protests stemming from an ongoing movement, thus requiring a completely new cause to emerge within the short timeframe. I find this reasoning unconvincing. The clause refers to a specific, ongoing protest *event* (e.g., a continuous sit-in that started before the question launch), not the entire underlying political *movement*. Therefore, a new rally related to a pre-existing issue, like the land law mentioned in the background, would qualify as long as the specific rally itself starts after the question's launch. This invalidates the primary argument for Forecaster 3's very low probability.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis aligns more closely with my own initial thoughts, emphasizing India's high base rate of large protests. Their confidence in this base rate is persuasive and has caused me to reconsider the raw likelihood of a qualifying event occurring. They correctly identify that the sheer frequency of protests makes it probable that one will happen in a two-month window.\n\nHowever, I believe Forecaster 2 (at 70%) somewhat underweights the risk that both Forecaster 3 and I noted: the reliance on a single, non-real-time data source. The Global Protest Tracker is a research project, not a news wire, and a reporting lag is a significant factor. A protest occurring in mid-to-late June might not be logged before the July 1 deadline. This reporting friction is the main reason I cannot fully endorse their 70% forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a modest upward revision to my forecast. My initial forecast of 55% was a slight lean towards 'Yes'. The deliberation has solidified my reasoning and shifted my confidence.\n\nMy disagreement with Forecaster 3's strict interpretation of the rules strengthens my belief that the pool of potential qualifying protests is large, including escalations of current tensions. This negates the main argument for a low probability.\n\nForecaster 2's strong emphasis on the high base rate of major protests in India was a compelling point. It has convinced me that the probability of a qualifying protest *occurring* within the nearly two-month window is higher than I initially estimated, likely in the 75-80% range. India's political climate is consistently volatile, and the 10,000-person threshold is frequently met.\n\nHowever, I am not moving my forecast as high as 70% because the issue of reporting lag remains a critical uncertainty. The single-source resolution criteria mean we are forecasting not just the event, but the documentation of the event. This reporting filter significantly tempers the high base rate. A protest in late June has a considerable chance of being missed by the resolution deadline.\n\nTherefore, I am updating my forecast from 55% to 60%. This reflects an increased confidence that a qualifying protest will happen, per Forecaster 2's reasoning, while still heavily weighting the significant risk of a reporting failure that could result in a 'No' outcome.",
