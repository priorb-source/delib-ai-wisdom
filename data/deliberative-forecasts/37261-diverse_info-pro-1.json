    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that my initial analysis lacked. Forecaster 2’s focus on the Global Protest Tracker’s behavior—specifically its infrequent updates and high editorial bar for what constitutes a log-worthy protest ‘wave’—was a powerful and convincing counterargument to my high confidence. This insight about the tracker's nature as a curated list of historic events, rather than a simple log, is the most important new consideration. Forecaster 3’s data-driven point about the declining average size of protests, while based on a different research report, effectively tempers expectations about the likelihood of a *new* qualifying protest emerging in the short time remaining. Both analyses correctly identified that my 95% forecast placed far too much certainty on the administrative and editorial action of a third party (Carnegie), which is the primary bottleneck and source of uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, lowering it from 95% to 58%. My initial reasoning was flawed because it assumed the April 5th ‘Hands Off!’ campaign, due to its large scale, would automatically be included in the Global Protest Tracker, making the only uncertainty the reporting timeline. The deliberation with my colleagues has convinced me that the primary uncertainty is not the timeline, but Carnegie's editorial judgment. A review of the tracker shows it only lists U.S. events of exceptional historical significance (e.g., Women's March 2017, George Floyd protests 2020), not every large-scale mobilization. Therefore, my confidence that the April 5th protest will be added by July 1st has decreased dramatically. I now estimate a roughly 50% chance that Carnegie's editors will deem the protest significant enough to warrant a new entry. However, I am still more optimistic than my colleagues. A nationwide, coordinated protest involving over half a million people is a major event that I believe stands a strong chance of clearing even a high editorial bar. My updated forecast of 58% reflects this revised, more moderate confidence in the April 5th event being logged, while also incorporating the small but non-zero probability, raised by the other forecasters, that a new qualifying event (e.g., in response to a Supreme Court decision) could occur and be reported before the deadline.",
