    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, structured reasoning that complements my own. We all agree on the core evidence: the recent acceleration in signings establishes a strong positive baseline. Forecaster 2 correctly raises the issue of potential saturation, arguing that the most likely candidates may have already signed, which is a valid long-term consideration that tempers expectations. Forecaster 3 introduces the most critical new piece of evidence: the clustering of signings around major events, specifically identifying the Paris Air Show scheduled for June 16-22, 2025. This provides a concrete mechanism and venue for a signing to occur within the resolution window, moving the analysis beyond simple trend extrapolation. Both forecasters rightly emphasize the inherent unpredictability of diplomatic timing, which serves as a necessary check on overconfidence. Their more moderate forecasts (55% and 60%) are convincing in that they weigh this uncertainty more heavily than my initial analysis did.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a slight downward adjustment to my forecast. My initial forecast of 65% was heavily weighted on the strong recent signing rate of roughly 1.5 countries per month in 2025. The other forecasters convinced me that I may have slightly undervalued two key factors. First, as noted by both, is the potential for saturation and diminishing returns as the pool of 'easy' signatories shrinks. This suggests the very high pace of early 2025 may not be sustainable. Second is the general uncertainty of diplomatic timing; without a public announcement, a signing can easily slip from one month to the next. These points argue for slightly less confidence. However, Forecaster 3's point about the Paris Air Show (June 16-22, 2025) provides a powerful, specific catalyst for a signing to occur *in June*. This major aerospace event is an ideal venue for such a diplomatic announcement. This new positive evidence partially counteracts the new cautionary points. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 65% to 62%. This change reflects an incorporation of the other forecasters' valid cautions about saturation and timing, while still weighting the combination of recent momentum and the specific catalyst of the Paris Air Show as making a June signing more likely than not.",
