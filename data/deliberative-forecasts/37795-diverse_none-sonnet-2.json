    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes compelling arguments about status quo persistence and timeline - we're already 45-50 games into the season with only 25-30 games until resolution, which reduces variance. Their identification of the A's and White Sox as main competitors is useful. However, their 65% forecast seems overconfident given we lack current standings data. Even if the Rockies are genuinely worst right now, baseball variance over 25-30 games is non-trivial, and multiple teams compete for worst record. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning, using a cluster-based approach with 5-6 plausible candidates yielding a 17-20% baseline. Their emphasis on the lack of live standings data keeping estimates closer to priors is sound. The key insight from both forecasters is that we're far enough into the season that standings have stabilized somewhat, but not so far that being uniquely worst is a certainty for any single team.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining closer to Forecaster 3's range than Forecaster 2's. The strongest argument for increasing my estimate is the status quo effect - by mid-May with ~45 games played, team quality is better established than I initially weighted. If the Rockies are currently in the bottom 2-3, the short 4-week window to June 15 makes major movement less likely. However, several factors prevent me from going as high as 65%: (1) we lack current standings confirmation, (2) multiple teams (White Sox, A's, Marlins, Angels) are credible competitors for worst record, (3) baseball retains significant game-to-game variance even over 25 games, and (4) being THE worst team (not just bottom-3) on a specific date is a precise outcome. The Rockies' chronic organizational dysfunction and pitching problems at altitude make them a strong candidate, likely above the equiprobable 17-20% baseline for 5-6 bottom teams. But without evidence they're currently isolated in last place, prudence suggests a modest premium rather than declaring them overwhelming favorites. I'm settling around 28% - recognizing them as a leading candidate while acknowledging the multi-team competition for worst record.",
