    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. UK local elections are scheduled for Thursday, May 1, 2025, with results typically announced within 24-48 hours.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party currently controls West Northamptonshire Council, having won a majority in the inaugural 2021 election when the unitary authority was formed. If the current composition remained unchanged, the answer would be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour or another party wins the most seats, capitalizing on strong national anti-Conservative sentiment. Recent UK-wide trends show Labour performing exceptionally well in local elections, and this translates to gains in West Northamptonshire, potentially with vote consolidation among opposition voters seeking change.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives retain the most seats by maintaining their local base despite national headwinds. Local factors, candidate quality, and traditional Conservative strength in Northamptonshire constituencies prove more important than national trends, or opposition vote splitting allows Conservatives to win plurality despite losing vote share.",
    "rationale": "West Northamptonshire Council was formed in 2021 with Conservatives winning a clear majority. However, the national political landscape has shifted dramatically since then. Throughout 2023-2024, the Conservative Party experienced historic losses in local elections, with Labour making substantial gains. The Conservative government faced challenges with economic issues, leadership changes, and polling consistently showed Labour ahead by significant margins. While local elections can sometimes deviate from national trends due to strong local campaigns or candidates, the proximity to the election (10 days away) means the current political environment is essentially set. Without specific polling data for West Northamptonshire, I must rely on national trends and recent local election results, which strongly favor Labour. The Conservatives' incumbency advantage and traditional strength in parts of Northamptonshire provide some counterweight, but typically not enough to overcome such strong national headwinds. This forecast would be higher if: recent local polling showed Conservatives ahead, the area had historically strong resistance to national trends, or there was evidence of exceptional local Conservative campaigning. It would be lower if: specific polling showed a Labour landslide locally, or if the area had shown particularly strong swings away from Conservatives in recent by-elections.",
