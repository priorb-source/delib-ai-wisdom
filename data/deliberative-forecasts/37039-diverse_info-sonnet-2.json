    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I lacked: the tariff is already codified in the HTS at 31% under subheading 9903.01.60, and critically, there's a 90-day suspension through July 9, 2025. Forecaster 3's point about the resolution criteria is decisive - suspension status doesn't affect resolution, meaning the 31% listing just needs to appear on June 1 regardless of whether it's actively enforced. This fundamentally changes the analysis. Both forecasters correctly emphasize status quo bias and the short 5-week window. Their logic is sound: the suspension extending beyond June 1 reduces immediate pressure to modify the HTS entry, and bureaucratic/policy inertia strongly favors maintaining the listing as-is.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated the probability in my initial forecast. The critical facts are: (1) the 31% tariff is already formally listed in the HTS; (2) it's suspended through July 9, which extends past the June 1 resolution date; (3) the resolution explicitly ignores suspension status - only the listing matters; (4) only 5 weeks remain, insufficient for the complex diplomatic and administrative processes needed to remove or modify the tariff entry. My original 65% reflected uncertainty about whether the tariff was codified - that uncertainty is eliminated. The status quo is that the 31% will appear on June 1 (likely marked as suspended, but irrelevant per resolution criteria). For a No outcome, Switzerland would need to negotiate a deal AND the administration would need to issue a new proclamation modifying 9903.01.60 AND USITC would need to update the schedule - all before June 1. While Switzerland's unique position (0% tariffs, 500K US jobs, wealthy ally) creates some possibility of a rapid carve-out deal, the 90-day suspension window suggests negotiations are expected to extend beyond June 1. I'm updating to 85%, slightly below the other forecasters' 87-88% to account for Switzerland's unusually strong negotiating position and small possibility of administrative acceleration, but much higher than my original forecast given the decisive status quo evidence.",
