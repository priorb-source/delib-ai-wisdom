    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, 11 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The CDC's current recommendation for community water fluoridation is 0.7 mg/L. If nothing changes, the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly announced HHS review is fast-tracked due to political pressure. It concludes that the current evidence supports a lower optimal level, and the CDC updates its guidance to a value below 0.7 mg/L before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review of fluoridation guidance proceeds at a typical bureaucratic pace. The review is still ongoing or has just begun its work by July 1, 2025, leaving the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation unchanged on the CDC's website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo due to the powerful force of institutional inertia in public health agencies. The timeline is the most critical factor here. A review of a decades-old, foundational public health policy like water fluoridation, announced on April 10, 2025, is extremely unlikely to proceed from announcement to a finalized, peer-reviewed, and published change in official guidance in under three months. Such processes typically take a year or more, involving literature reviews, expert panels, public comment periods, and multiple layers of internal approval. The NPR article indicates an HHS review is happening, which introduces a legitimate vector for change and prevents this from being a 99% forecast. This review seems to be prompted by political pressure, which can sometimes accelerate bureaucratic timelines. However, overcoming the scientific and procedural hurdles to formally change a recommendation like this in such a short period remains a formidable challenge. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the initiation of a formal review by HHS is a significant event that signals genuine uncertainty and political will to re-examine the issue. A rapid, politically-driven directive to change the recommendation cannot be entirely ruled out. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the default outcome for any bureaucratic process over a short time horizon is no change. The weight of scientific consensus and procedural requirements overwhelmingly suggests that the 0.7 mg/L recommendation will still be in place on the resolution date. \n\nI would update my forecast towards 'No' if there were official announcements of an expedited timeline, leaks of preliminary findings suggesting a change, or high-profile statements from the HHS Secretary indicating a preference for a lower number. I would update towards 'Yes' if HHS released a timeline for the review that extends beyond 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
