  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 3 weeks. Cornwall Council elections typically occur in early May, likely around May 1st, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservatives remain the largest party on Cornwall Council, maintaining a plurality of seats despite losses to other parties.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives lose significant seats to both Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, but retain a plurality. Reform UK emerges as the second-largest party by capitalizing on the right-wing vote split, while Liberal Democrats make modest gains but remain in third place with approximately 20-30 seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A perfect storm occurs: Conservative support collapses completely due to national unpopularity and leadership instability. Reform UK successfully splits the right-wing vote but fails to convert this into seats due to vote distribution. Liberal Democrats, leveraging their strong candidate slate, fundraising, and momentum from the 2024 general election victories, sweep across Cornwall and win 45+ seats to become the largest party for the first time in history.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The Liberal Democrats face a formidable 31-seat deficit (13 vs 44) and have never historically been the largest party on Cornwall Council. To win most seats, they would need to nearly quadruple their representation - an extraordinary swing.\n\nPositive factors for Liberal Democrats include: Conservative national unpopularity (22% approval), Reform UK vote splitting (polling at 25%), recent general election successes in North Cornwall and St Ives, strong local organization with near-full candidate slate and £100k fundraising, and Conservative leadership instability with Linda Taylor retiring.\n\nHowever, critical constraints exist: Liberal Democrats poll nationally at only 14-16% (lower than Reform UK at 25%), making large-scale gains difficult. Even with Conservative collapse, Reform UK is better positioned to capture disaffected right-wing voters. Local elections can diverge from national trends, but the magnitude of swing required (30+ seats) is unprecedented for this council.\n\nThe scenario requires multiple perfect conditions: total Conservative collapse, Reform UK failing to convert vote share into seats, and Liberal Democrats significantly outperforming national polling. While possible, this combination is highly improbable.\n\nI'm not forecasting lower (e.g., 2-5%) because: the Conservative position is genuinely weak, vote splitting is real, and local elections can produce surprises. I'm not forecasting higher (e.g., 20-30%) because: the historical and current deficit is massive, Liberal Democrat national polling is mediocre, and the most likely beneficiary of Conservative losses is Reform UK, not Liberal Democrats.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence of Liberal Democrat local polling showing them competitive for most seats, or Electoral Calculus MRP showing Lib Dems winning. To update lower: evidence Reform UK is winning Conservative seats directly, or Conservatives stabilizing locally.",
