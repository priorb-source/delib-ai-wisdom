    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical piece of information I had not considered: Kadyrov's history of making identical statements about stepping down (at least three times in 2016, 2020, and 2022) with zero follow-through. This historical pattern is extremely important for establishing a base rate - if he's done this 3+ times before without resigning, the probability this time is different should be quite low absent strong contrary evidence. Forecaster 3 also mentions a May 7 Putin meeting with supportive language, which if accurate, suggests continuity rather than transition. Forecaster 2 mentions health issues and a 17-year-old son, but these details don't appear in our research assistant's report, so I'm uncertain about their provenance. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the extremely compressed 20-day timeline. The historical precedent argument is particularly compelling - it transforms this from 'unprecedented public resignation statement' to 'recurring pattern of political theater.' This dramatically lowers the probability.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward based primarily on Forecaster 3's historical pattern argument. If Kadyrov has made similar resignation statements 3+ times in recent years without following through, this establishes a strong base rate suggesting political theater rather than genuine intent. Combined with: (1) only 20 days remaining for a complex political transition, (2) the apparent Putin support on May 7, (3) no concrete succession mechanism activated, (4) no announced resignation date, and (5) Kadyrov's May 12 comments focusing on Ukraine operations rather than resignation, the evidence strongly favors status quo. I'm not going as low as 5% because genuine uncertainty remains - unexpected health emergencies, rapid political changes, or this time being genuinely different are possible. But the historical pattern significantly undermines taking the May 6 statement at face value. My original 10% insufficiently weighted the precedent of false starts.",
