    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the ENSO transition and the historical cooling from El Niño to La Niña, which is a meaningful headwind for breaking monthly records. That’s a useful counterweight to my prior leaning on the persistence of extreme SSTs. Forecaster 3 adds the data point that April 2025 was only second warmest (in at least some datasets), which is a relevant, timely signal that the record-shattering streak is no longer automatic. However, F3’s reference to May 2020 as the record to beat appears incorrect for NOAA’s Land+Ocean series—May 2024 was almost certainly the warmest May on record there—so their bar-setting is off. Both forecasters underweight the persistence of near-record global SSTs (especially the North Atlantic) and non-ENSO forcings that have kept anomalies elevated, as well as the lag with which ENSO transmits to global-mean temperature. Still, their points about the high bar set by May 2024 and the plausibility of a narrow #2 finish are well taken.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating downward, mainly due to two considerations raised: (1) the high bar set by May 2024 in NOAA’s dataset, and (2) April 2025 likely ranking second, which suggests a slight step-down as El Niño’s boost fades. Even with very warm global SSTs and lingering non-ENSO forcings, small month-to-month margins often decide ranks. Given that, a #2 outcome for May 2025 is quite plausible. Counterbalancing that, ocean warmth remains extraordinary and ENSO’s cooling influence typically lags—factors that keep a record May firmly in play. Net effect: I reduce from 76% to 62%, reflecting increased weight on the possibility that May 2025 narrowly misses NOAA’s #1 ranking while still expecting a top-tier finish.",
