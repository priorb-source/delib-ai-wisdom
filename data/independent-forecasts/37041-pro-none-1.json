    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About five weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no North American country has a specific CDC yellow fever travel health notice.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The increase in yellow fever cases mentioned in the PAHO alert remains contained within existing endemic areas in South America. No significant local transmission occurs in any North American country that would prompt the CDC to issue a travel advisory by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An outbreak of yellow fever, potentially linked to the rising cases in South America, occurs in a North American country with the appropriate mosquito vector, such as Panama or a Caribbean nation. The outbreak is identified and deemed significant enough for the CDC to issue a formal Travel Health Notice by June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo. Currently, no North American country has a CDC Travel Health Notice for yellow fever, and such advisories for this region are historically rare. The primary factor suggesting a 'Yes' outcome is the PAHO alert from late March 2025 about rising cases in the Americas. This increases the background risk of spillover into countries with the mosquito vector, most plausibly Panama, which is in North America and has endemic yellow fever zones. However, the timeline of just over one month is very short. It takes time for an outbreak to establish, be detected, reported, and then for an agency like the CDC to assess the data and issue a formal notice. My probability is not lower because the PAHO alert indicates a real, heightened regional risk, and yellow fever outbreaks can be explosive. My probability is not higher because of the short timeframe and the general effectiveness of public health surveillance and vector control, which makes it unlikely an outbreak would escalate to the level of a CDC advisory so quickly. I would raise my forecast upon news of confirmed local transmission in a North American country. I would lower it if reports indicated the South American outbreaks were being successfully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
