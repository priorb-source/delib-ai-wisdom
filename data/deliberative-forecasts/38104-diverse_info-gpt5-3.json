    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete claims about manhunt scale (200+ officers, FBI/ATF/Marshals), 14 accomplices arrested, $50k rewards, and 700 tips. If accurate, these materially increase the daily capture hazard via pressure on networks and public incentives. However, I can’t independently verify those figures here, and their 92% seems overconfident given the last-two problem and the profiles of Massey (serial escapee) and Groves (violent, high-sentence incentive). Forecaster 3 stresses the “all must be caught” bar, inside-job sophistication, and heavy-tailed timelines for holdouts—points I largely share. They underweight the demonstrated cross-state reach and momentum of captures to date, but their 30% is directionally consistent with the high bar and late-stage difficulty.",
    "rationale": "My prior view was that late-stage recaptures follow a slower, heavy-tailed hazard; with ~32 days left, per-person capture odds are moderate, but the requirement to get both makes the joint probability below even odds. The remaining two are plausibly the most capable and motivated, with Massey’s prior escapes a notable negative signal. Evidence pushing up: eight caught in two weeks (including out-of-state), multi-agency engagement, and the possibility that risky behavior generates leads; fatalities would also count toward Yes. Evidence pushing down: last-two dynamic, inside-job support, and the fact that only one needs to remain free to resolve No. Forecaster 2’s specific numbers, if validated, would nudge me up a few points due to increased pressure on support networks and public tip flow; absent verification, I keep them as a modest positive prior. Net, I maintain a modestly-below-even forecast, reflecting strong pursuit but a tough bar and the fugitives’ profiles.",
