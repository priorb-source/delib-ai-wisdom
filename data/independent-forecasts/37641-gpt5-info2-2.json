  "information": "Circle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 14, 2025, Circle is not yet publicly traded on the NYSE.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SEC review takes longer than expected, market conditions wobble, or Circle/underwriters choose to price after the July 4 holiday—pushing first trade into July or later. A venue change to Nasdaq would also produce a No even if it lists before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SEC declares the registration effective in June, Circle runs a brief roadshow, prices the deal in the second half of June, and begins trading on the NYSE before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Signals point to a near-term listing window, but timing risk is meaningful. Circle publicly filed for an IPO in early April per press coverage, naming the NYSE as the venue, which typically implies an intent to list within weeks to a couple of months once SEC comments are resolved. The remaining calendar (late May through late June) is a standard window to price before the July 4 holiday. However, IPO timelines often slip, and crypto-adjacent listings can attract extra regulatory scrutiny.\n\nEvidence pushing Yes: public S-1 in April, credible scale ($60B USDC float), and 2024 profitability ($155.7M net income) despite a deceleration; market interest in crypto/fintech names in early 2025; and the desire to list before potential interest-rate cuts lower reserve-income tailwinds. The Forbes framing (“Circle IPO … solidifies 2025 as the year of stablecoins”) suggests momentum.\n\nEvidence tempering the odds: status quo is still No until trading starts; the window is tight (about 6–7 weeks). SEC review for a high-profile crypto-adjacent issuer could extend. Circle’s earnings are highly rate-sensitive (99% of revenue from reserve income) and concentrated (large Coinbase distribution fees of ~$908M in 2024), which could prompt additional disclosure iterations or valuation debates. Any bout of market or crypto volatility could push the deal to post-holiday July, which would resolve No.\n\nWhy not higher: Non-trivial probability of a slip past July 1 due to SEC comments, market windows, or issuer choice to avoid a holiday-adjacent debut. Why not lower: They’ve already publicly filed and indicated NYSE, suggesting late-stage readiness; two months from public filing to trade is well within historical norms.\n\nUpdates that would move me up: SEC effectiveness notice; filing of a price range and launch of the roadshow; NYSE listing/ticker confirmation and an announced target pricing week. Updates that would move me down: headlines about deferral, additional SEC comment rounds, a switch of venue to Nasdaq, or a sharp crypto/market drawdown reducing IPO appetite.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
