  "information": "The Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the April 4, 2025 New York Times article, a 31% tariff on Switzerland appears to have been announced by the Trump administration, with Swiss officials and markets already reacting to it. The status quo suggests this tariff is in place or strongly committed to.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Switzerland successfully negotiates a reduction or elimination of the tariff before June 1. The Swiss government leverages its strong economic arguments (0% tariffs on US goods, 500,000 US jobs created by Swiss companies) to convince the Trump administration to modify the policy. Alternatively, the tariff is delayed, suspended, or the harmonized tariff schedule is not officially updated to reflect the 31% rate by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration maintains the 31% tariff through June 1, 2025. Despite Swiss diplomatic protests and the apparent unfairness given Switzerland's 0% tariff policy, the administration proceeds with the tariff as part of its broader trade strategy. The harmonized tariff schedule is officially updated to show the 31% duty rate for Switzerland under the specified subheading by June 1.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests Trump has already announced a 31% tariff on Switzerland, as indicated by the Swiss government's public reaction and market impacts on Swiss watch manufacturers. However, several factors create uncertainty: First, while announced, it's unclear if the tariff has been formally codified in the harmonized tariff schedule yet. Second, Switzerland presents a uniquely sympathetic case - it has 0% tariffs on US imports, creates 500,000 US jobs, and is a small, wealthy ally rather than a major competitor. Third, 5 weeks provides sufficient time for diplomatic negotiations or policy adjustments. The Trump administration has historically been resistant to quickly reversing tariff decisions once announced, which supports a higher probability. However, Switzerland's strong economic and diplomatic position, combined with the relatively modest strategic importance of Swiss trade compared to larger partners, suggests meaningful possibility of modification. The forecast is not higher because diplomatic efforts could succeed and because there's uncertainty about whether the tariff is already formally in the schedule. It's not lower because the announcement appears firm, markets have reacted, and the Trump administration has shown consistency in maintaining tariff policies despite international objections.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
