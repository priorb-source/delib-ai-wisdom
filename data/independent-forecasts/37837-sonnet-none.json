    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. June 2025 ends on June 30, 2025, and the data will be accessed on or after July 1, 2025, giving us about 38 days until June ends plus a few days for data posting.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on historical averages, NUFORC would receive somewhere between 250-400 reports for June 2025. The center has processed 180,000+ reports over 50 years (averaging ~300/month historically), though reporting rates have likely increased in recent years due to easier online submission and heightened UAP interest.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees typical or below-average reporting levels, with 400 or fewer sightings reported. This could occur if weather conditions limit outdoor activities, no significant UAP-related news drives increased public attention, or if monthly reporting continues at baseline levels without exceptional events.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 exceeds 400 reports due to favorable summer weather encouraging outdoor activities and sky watching, continuation of elevated reporting trends from recent years driven by government UAP disclosures, or a major sighting event or news story in June 2025 that spurs increased public reporting.",
    "rationale": "The critical uncertainty is the current baseline monthly reporting rate for NUFORC. The 50-year historical average of ~300 reports/month is likely outdated given: (1) easier online reporting mechanisms, (2) increased public interest following government UAP disclosures since 2020, and (3) social media amplification of sightings. June being a summer month in the Northern Hemisphere typically correlates with more outdoor activity, potentially driving higher reporting. The threshold of 400 reports represents approximately 33% above the historical average, suggesting it would be an above-average but not extraordinary month. Without access to recent monthly data (2023-2025), I cannot determine if 400 is now typical, above average, or below average for recent months. My forecast would be higher if I had evidence showing recent monthly averages consistently exceed 350-400 reports. It would be lower if recent data showed monthly reports typically remain below 300. The status quo principle suggests gradual changes, so dramatic month-to-month variations are unlikely unless triggered by specific events. I estimate roughly even odds with slight upward pressure from seasonal effects and likely trend continuation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
