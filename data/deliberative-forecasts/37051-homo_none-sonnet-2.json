    "review": "The other forecasters present compelling analyses that strongly align with my original reasoning. All three of us independently identified the same critical constraints: the 67-day timeline, standard IRS procedural requirements, inevitable legal challenges, absence of concrete action, and historical precedent. Their consensus at 3% versus my 4% reflects marginal but meaningful differences in emphasis. Forecaster 2's distinction between threats and actual administrative action is particularly salient - political rhetoric frequently doesn't translate to implementable policy, especially on compressed timelines. Forecaster 3's point about IRS operational independence despite executive branch placement adds an important institutional constraint I underweighted. Both forecasters effectively frame this as a compound probability problem: we would need immediate IRS action AND expedited procedures AND failed legal challenges AND no procedural delays - the conjunction of these unlikely events makes the overall probability very low. Their arguments about the threats-versus-action gap are persuasive. While I still believe the Trump administration's demonstrated willingness to take aggressive actions creates some elevated tail risk, the other forecasters have convinced me that I may have slightly overweighted this factor relative to the formidable procedural and legal barriers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast down from 4% to 3% to align with the strong consensus. The key factors remain: (1) only 67 days until resolution creates an almost insurmountable timeline constraint, (2) IRS revocation procedures require formal notice, opportunity to respond, and review processes that typically span months or years, (3) Harvard would immediately file for injunctions creating additional delays, (4) we have only threats reported, not concrete administrative action, and (5) base rates for major universities losing tax-exempt status are essentially zero. The other forecasters strengthened my conviction about the threats-versus-action gap - presidential statements, even explicit ones, often don't materialize into administrative outcomes, particularly when facing legal and procedural barriers. While unprecedented political pressure creates some non-zero tail risk (hence not forecasting 1%), the procedural realities and legal safeguards make this outcome highly improbable within the timeframe. The compound probability of all necessary conditions occurring (immediate IRS action, expedited procedures, failed legal challenges, no delays) is extremely low.",
