    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - regular diplomatic communication would be expected",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy do not have a phone call during this period. This could occur if diplomatic communications proceed through intermediaries, if relations are particularly strained, if they meet in person instead, or if Trump prioritizes other issues over direct engagement with Zelenskyy. The specific requirement that both sides publicly acknowledge the call could also prevent resolution if a call occurs but isn't confirmed by both parties.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy have at least one phone conversation during this 33-day window. This could happen during routine diplomatic coordination on military aid, as part of ongoing peace negotiations regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in response to a sudden crisis or military development, or as part of regular check-ins between the US president and a key allied leader during wartime.",
    "rationale": "With 33 days remaining in the resolution window, I need to assess the likelihood of at least one phone call between these leaders. Several factors favor a Yes outcome: Trump is currently serving as US President with stated goals of resolving the Ukraine conflict; Ukraine remains heavily dependent on US military and economic support; and normal diplomatic practice during an active conflict typically involves regular leader-to-leader communication. The one-month window provides reasonable opportunity for at least one call. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: I have no information about recent communication patterns or whether a call already occurred on May 12; the Trump-Zelenskyy relationship has been historically complicated (notably the 'perfect phone call' impeachment episode); and diplomacy might proceed through intermediaries rather than direct calls. The requirement that both sides acknowledge the call adds a minor procedural hurdle. Base rates suggest sitting US presidents typically communicate with critical allied leaders during crises at least monthly, especially when major aid and policy decisions are involved. However, given the complicated relationship history and lack of current information, substantial uncertainty remains. A 60% probability reflects that a call is more likely than not given the geopolitical stakes and time window, but accounts for the real possibility of intermediated diplomacy, scheduling conflicts, or relationship tensions. I would update higher with evidence of active peace negotiations or planned calls, and lower with reports of diplomatic tensions or evidence of exclusively indirect communication channels.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
