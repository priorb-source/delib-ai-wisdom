  "information": "As of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Mozambique does not currently have a Level 4 travel advisory and maintains a lower-level advisory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The protests mentioned in the background article subside or remain contained. Security conditions in Mozambique stabilize at current levels. The insurgency in Cabo Delgado province continues but doesn't significantly worsen or spread. The U.S. State Department maintains Mozambique's existing travel advisory level (likely Level 2 or 3) through July 1, 2025, judging that conditions don't warrant the most severe warning.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political protests escalate dramatically and spread nationwide. Widespread violence erupts, government authority collapses in major areas, or there are significant attacks targeting foreigners or U.S. citizens. The insurgency in Cabo Delgado expands significantly. The security situation deteriorates so severely that the U.S. State Department determines no Americans should travel to Mozambique under any circumstances, elevating it to Level 4 status.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Currently, only 21 countries worldwide have Level 4 advisories - this designation is reserved for the most extreme situations involving active conflicts, complete government collapse, widespread terrorism, or imminent danger to all travelers. Countries on this list include Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and North Korea. While Mozambique faces challenges including protests mentioned in the background article and an ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado province, these issues have persisted for years without triggering a Level 4 advisory. The U.S. State Department elevates countries to Level 4 infrequently and only when conditions are truly catastrophic. The research assistant notes that South Sudan was recently elevated to Level 4 in March 2025, demonstrating the Department does make changes, but this also shows how rare such upgrades are. The 2-month timeframe is relatively short for such a dramatic deterioration to occur. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because: (1) active protests are occurring, (2) the insurgency poses real security risks, and (3) rapid deterioration, while unlikely, is possible if protests escalate significantly or if there's a major security incident. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of massive violence escalation, government collapse, evacuation of U.S. embassy personnel, or attacks on foreigners. For me to revise downward, I would need clear signs of protest resolution and security improvement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
