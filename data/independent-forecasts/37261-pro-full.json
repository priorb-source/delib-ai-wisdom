  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months. The resolution window closes on July 1, 2025. The outcome will be known once the Global Protest Tracker has had sufficient time to update its data for this period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current political environment features large, coordinated protest movements. Based on the provided research, massive nationwide demonstrations occurred in April and May 2025, making it highly probable that at least one individual protest exceeded the 10,000 participant threshold and will be reported by the tracker.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No new large-scale protests occur before the deadline. More importantly, the Global Protest Tracker either fails to update its database with information from the April and May 2025 protests in time, or its specific crowd-size estimate for every single protest location falls below the 10,000-participant threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker updates its data to reflect the largescale 'Hands Off!' or '50501' protest movements and reports that a specific demonstration in a major U.S. city, such as Washington D.C. or Los Angeles, had 10,000 or more participants. Alternatively, another major political event before July 1 triggers a new protest of this magnitude which is subsequently reported.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high likelihood that a qualifying event has already occurred. The research report details two major nationwide protests in the past two months: the 'Hands Off!' campaign on April 5, with an estimated 600,000 attendees across more than 1,200 rallies, and the '50501' movement on May 1, with major demonstrations in several large cities. While protest attendance is not evenly distributed, it is highly probable that the main rallies in hubs like Washington D.C., Chicago, or Los Angeles surpassed the 10,000-participant threshold. The key variable is not the occurrence of the event, but its reporting by the designated source, the Global Protest Tracker. Given the scale of these events, it is very likely they will be cataloged. The ongoing political tensions and campus protests also suggest the potential for new large protests in the remaining two-month window is significant. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for the risk of a significant reporting lag by the Global Protest Tracker or a surprisingly conservative counting methodology that puts all individual events below the required threshold. My probability is not lower because the sheer scale and frequency of recent activism make it improbable that not a single protest in a country of over 330 million people would meet this threshold amidst such mobilization, and that a reputable tracker would miss all of them. I would increase my forecast if I saw confirmation that the tracker has a rapid update cycle for U.S. events. I would decrease it if I learned the tracker has a major backlog or a history of not reporting city-specific numbers for national protests.",
