    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are strikingly similar to my own, both in terms of the evidence cited and the core logic. We all agree that the consistent and significant Liberal lead across multiple recent polls is the primary evidence favoring a 'No' outcome. We also all identify the same two key sources of uncertainty that could lead to a 'Yes' outcome: a potential turnout differential driven by the higher commitment of Conservative voters, and the possibility of a systemic polling error. The reasoning from both forecasters is sound and convincing. The only difference is a minor one of degree, with Forecaster 2 arriving at a slightly more confident 12% probability versus my and Forecaster 3's 15%. This small divergence reflects a subtle difference in weighting the uncertainty factors, not a fundamental disagreement on the facts or logic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. My reasoning has not changed, as the other forecasters did not introduce any new evidence or arguments I had not already considered. Their analyses serve to reinforce my initial conclusions. The consensus on the key drivers of the forecast strengthens my confidence in the overall analytical approach. I am holding at 15% rather than lowering to 12% because I believe the 13-point gap in voter commitment (76% for Conservatives vs. 63% for Liberals) is a significant factor that warrants a slightly higher probability for an upset. While a polling error of 5-7 points is unlikely on its own, the combination of a better-than-expected Conservative turnout and a moderate polling miss could plausibly close the existing gap. My 15% forecast is intended to reflect the non-trivial probability of this compound event occurring. It acknowledges the strength of the polling data while still respecting the significant uncertainties present.",
