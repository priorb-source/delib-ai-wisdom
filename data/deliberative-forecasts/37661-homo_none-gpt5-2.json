    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial take: short but plausible runway, with key execution risks in licensing formalities, terminal type approvals/imports, payments, and potential gateway/data-landing requirements. The most useful added angles were: (1) potential government-only/limited pilot that wouldn’t trigger a consumer “Available” flip on the map; (2) website-update lag even after licensing; and (3) Bangladesh-specific friction points (payments/FX, and a relatively regulated environment). These nuances incrementally increase delay risk within a ~45-day window.\n\nForecaster 2’s optimism (58%) rests on recent fast rollouts in supportive markets and laser backhaul reducing dependency on local gateways; that’s reasonable but still contingent on commercial readiness. Forecaster 3’s more conservative stance (40%) highlights the possibility that the headline “final approval” isn’t the operative license yet and that BTRC processes could push past June; that aligns with typical slippage risk.\n\nNet, I find the added emphasis on government-only pilots and payment/logistics setup convincing enough to trim my probability slightly, though I still see the political signal and technical feasibility as keeping odds near-even.",
    "rationale": "We have ~46 days left. The reported top-level approval is a strong signal, and Starlink can technically serve Bangladesh without immediately standing up a local gateway. In fast-tracked markets, the map can flip within weeks once licenses and commerce ops are ready. However, to hit “Available” by July 1, several pieces must align quickly: formal BTRC license issuance and any spectrum/landing rights documentation, terminal type approval and customs clearance, tax/FX-compliant billing, and distribution/fulfillment. Bangladesh’s regulatory and payments environment can add friction, and a limited/government pilot wouldn’t necessarily produce a consumer “Available” status on the map in time. Given these near-term execution risks and the short window, I’m nudging down slightly from my initial estimate, but still stay just above even odds due to the political momentum and Starlink’s recent pace in the region.\n\nKey upside movers: official BTRC license publication with consumer terms; Starlink Bangladesh pricing/order page; reports of terminals cleared/imported; credible launch date announcements. Key downside movers: indications of additional conditions (gateway or data localization), statements framing approval as pilot-only, or silence past mid-June on licensing/commerce readiness.",
