    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point I hadn't explicitly considered: even if charges were filed, prominent defendants are typically allowed to surrender voluntarily rather than being arrested in the traditional sense. This significantly reduces the conditional probability of arrest given an indictment. Forecaster 3 cites a specific 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring subjective intent for threat prosecutions, which strengthens the legal barriers argument. Both emphasize that there are currently no charges, warrants, or subpoenas filed as of May 30, which with only 32 days remaining is highly significant. Forecaster 3's note that legal experts are skeptical of prosecution viability is important context from the research assistant's report that I should weight more heavily. I find Forecaster 2's point about unreliable sources (InfoWars, Flynn) claiming imminent action to be useful - if only unreliable sources are making such claims, that's evidence against imminent action. The convergence between both forecasters on the extremely compressed timeline and lack of concrete legal action is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I believe my initial forecast of 5% was slightly too high. The voluntary surrender point is particularly impactful - even an expedited indictment (already unlikely in 32 days) wouldn't necessarily result in an arrest as defined by the resolution criteria. The specific legal barriers (2023 Supreme Court precedent, First Amendment protections), combined with the complete absence of charges, warrants, or subpoenas as of May 30, argue for a lower probability. However, I don't think 3% fully accounts for the political unpredictability of this specific situation - a confirmed investigation involving a controversial former FBI Director and the current administration. The base rate for such events is near-zero, but not quite zero. I'm updating downward to 4%, which reflects: (1) extremely low probability due to compressed timeline and legal barriers, (2) voluntary surrender option even if charges filed, (3) no current evidence of imminent legal action, but (4) non-negligible risk given active investigation and unprecedented political dynamics.",
