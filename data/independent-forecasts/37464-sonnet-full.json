  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active on June 1, 2025, resulting in a No outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active through June 1 because FSIS has not completed its verification process to confirm all affected products have been removed from commerce and that adequate corrective actions have been implemented, despite the small size and limited scope of the recall",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 24 days, LPK1 successfully accounts for all recalled products from vending machines in Washington, completes required corrective actions, submits documentation to FSIS, and the agency completes its review and administratively closes the recall before June 1",
    "rationale": "This forecast centers on whether a relatively small, localized recall can be closed within 24 days when it has already remained Active for 74 days. Factors supporting closure include: (1) Very small quantity (303 pounds), (2) Limited geographic distribution (Washington state vending machines only), (3) All products expired by late February (2+ months ago), making removal straightforward, (4) No reported illnesses simplifying the closure process, and (5) Class II designation (moderate hazard). However, significant factors favor continued Active status: The recall has persisted for 74 days without closure, suggesting complexities in the verification process. FSIS recall closures require bureaucratic steps including verification of product accounting, removal confirmation, corrective action implementation, and administrative documentation. Even small recalls can take 3-6 months to close. The status quo strongly favors No since the recall is currently Active, and institutional processes rarely accelerate dramatically in short timeframes. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence that LPK1 has recently submitted closure documentation or that FSIS has initiated final verification steps. For it to move lower, I would need information suggesting complications in product tracking or corrective actions. The relatively small scale and expired nature of products provides modest probability of closure, but the slow progress to date and bureaucratic realities suggest the recall will likely remain Active past June 1. I estimate 32% probability of Yes",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
