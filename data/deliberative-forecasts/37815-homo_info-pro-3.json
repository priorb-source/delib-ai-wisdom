    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, correctly identified that the core of this problem is the historical base rate of qualifying reports on the NUFORC database. We all agree that such reports are rare, in the range of 1-3 per year for all of South America, and that the research assistant's report on US military encounters is not directly applicable. The forecasts (8%, 12%, 15%) are all in a reasonably tight cluster, with the differences stemming from how we each interpret the sparse data. Forecaster 2 raised an excellent point that I had not explicitly weighed: the nature of NUFORC as a US-centric, English-language platform acts as a significant filter, which helps explain why the base rate is so low and provides a strong argument for the status quo of infrequent reports continuing. Forecaster 3 provided a very clear calculation (2 reports/year -> ~17% monthly) before making a conservative adjustment down to 12%. I find both analyses convincing, and they collectively suggest my initial forecast may have been slightly too high.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on an estimate of roughly 1.8 qualifying reports per year. Both other forecasters also estimated the base rate at between 1 and 3 reports per year. Forecaster 3's analysis, calculating a ~17% probability from an average of 2 reports/year and then adjusting downward for conservatism, is a very sound approach. Forecaster 2's argument that the NUFORC platform itself acts as a major filter for non-US, non-English reports is particularly persuasive and reinforces the rationale for a conservative estimate. Given the sparseness of the data, where a single additional report in a year can significantly alter the average, it is prudent to be cautious. The other forecasters have convinced me that my initial estimate was likely based on the higher end of the long-term average. Adopting a more conservative central estimate, closer to 1.5 reports per year (which yields a monthly probability of 12.5%), seems more robust. This aligns well with Forecaster 3's position. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast to reflect this slightly more conservative interpretation of the base rate, informed by the deliberation.",
