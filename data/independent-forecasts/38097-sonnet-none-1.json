    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the candidates remain eligible to run unless specific action is taken against them before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The electoral authorities and courts take no action against these five specific candidates before July 1, 2025, allowing them to remain on the electoral list through the deadline. Any ongoing legal or administrative processes either conclude in their favor or extend beyond the July 1 cutoff date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Electoral authorities or the Constitutional Council disqualifies at least one of the five named candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) before July 1, 2025. This could occur through administrative rejection of candidacy requirements, judicial rulings on eligibility, or removal from the electoral list similar to what happened to the opposition leader mentioned in the BBC article.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is complicated by competing factors. On one hand, the BBC article confirms that electoral disqualifications are actively occurring in Ivory Coast, with a main opposition leader already removed from the electoral list. This establishes that the political and legal machinery for candidate disqualification is engaged and functioning. Ivory Coast has a history of contentious elections with eligibility disputes, particularly involving figures like Laurent and Simone Gbagbo. On the other hand, only 32 days remain until the resolution date, which is a very short window. For a disqualification to occur, there would need to be either: (1) ongoing proceedings already in motion that conclude before July 1, or (2) new, rapid action initiated and completed within this month. The status quo bias suggests that absent specific known threats to these candidates, most will likely remain eligible. My research assistant provided no additional information about imminent legal challenges or administrative reviews targeting these five specific individuals. The probability is elevated above a baseline due to the demonstrated pattern of disqualifications, but constrained by the tight timeframe and lack of evidence of specific ongoing proceedings. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of active legal cases or administrative reviews targeting these candidates. To revise downward, I would need confirmation that all five have cleared major eligibility hurdles or that the electoral process has stabilized.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
