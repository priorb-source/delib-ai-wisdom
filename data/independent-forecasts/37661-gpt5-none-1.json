    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, the Starlink Availability Map does not list Bangladesh as Available.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Implementation steps after the reported final approval take longer than expected: import/type approvals for terminals, commercial terms, payment rails, or a requirement for a local gateway/traffic landing in Bangladesh delays consumer launch. Starlink prioritizes government/enterprise pilots that don’t trigger the public map to show “Available,” or the website update lags past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the reported top-level approval, the regulator issues the necessary licenses and import/type approvals promptly. Starlink leverages laser backhaul to existing regional gateways, sets pricing, and begins sales/shipping. Starlink updates the availability map to show Bangladesh (possibly initially in select areas) as “Available” within the next few weeks.",
    "rationale": "Time is short but not prohibitive. The reported “final approval” by Bangladesh’s leadership is a strong positive signal that major regulatory hurdles are cleared, and in many countries Starlink’s map flips to “Available” within weeks to a couple of months after licensing. We have roughly six weeks left, which is within the historical range, especially given Starlink’s ability to operate using space-laser links to regional gateways. That said, I overweight the status quo because the world changes slowly and last-mile implementation often slips: Starlink still needs regulator paperwork finalized (license issuance details, spectrum terms), terminal type-approval/import permissions, local pricing/payment setup, and possibly compliance with any data landing requirements. Some countries permit rapid activation post-approval (e.g., quick turnarounds seen in parts of Southeast Asia), while others require additional steps or pilot phases before public availability. If Bangladesh limits initial use to government sites or mandates a domestic gateway first, the public map may not show “Available” by July 1. Why not higher: the window (≈45 days) is tight, and there is meaningful risk of administrative, logistics, or policy delays, plus potential website-update lag. Why not lower: a credible report of final approval suggests intent to proceed, regional technical feasibility exists, and Starlink has recently accelerated rollouts in new markets. What would move me up: official BTRC license issuance with clear consumer service terms; Starlink adding Bangladesh pricing/order page; reports of terminals cleared for import or arriving; news of live pilot sites. What would move me down: signs of additional regulatory conditions (e.g., mandatory local gateway build), legal challenges, payment/FX barriers, or statements framing the approval as limited to government-only pilots. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the noted article headline; thus, this forecast leans on general rollout patterns and the short timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
