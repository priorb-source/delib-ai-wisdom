    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar probabilities (7-12%), which validates the core analytical framework. The key shared insights include: the extremely short 57-day window, bankruptcy filings typically following extended distress patterns, multiple alternatives available before filing, and the absence of specific crisis indicators despite documented business model disruption from AI. Forecaster 3's explicit invocation of base rates for public company bankruptcies is a valuable Bayesian framing I should have emphasized more directly. Forecaster 2's highest forecast of 12% reflects appropriate humility about our lack of detailed financial data, though I find this slightly elevated given the near-total absence of imminent crisis signals. The most compelling shared argument is that even serious competitive threats (documented by WSJ) don't translate to bankruptcy filings in 57-day windows without acute liquidity triggers - which none of us can identify from available information. No forecaster raised evidence I hadn't considered, but Forecaster 3's base rate framing and explicit mention of missing 'going concern warnings' strengthens the case for low probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, my core reasoning remains sound but I'll make a marginal upward adjustment. The convergence around 7-12% across three independent forecasts suggests this range captures the appropriate uncertainty. Forecaster 3's base rate argument reinforces that bankruptcy filings by public companies within such compressed timeframes are statistically rare events requiring specific crisis triggers we haven't observed. However, Forecaster 2 appropriately notes that our lack of detailed current financial data (recent 10-Qs, cash positions, debt schedules) creates genuine uncertainty that prevents going below 5-7%. The WSJ article confirms structural challenges but not imminent insolvency. I'm adjusting slightly upward to 8% to acknowledge: (1) appropriate epistemic humility given information gaps, (2) slight deference to the group median, and (3) recognition that while 57 days makes bankruptcy unlikely, it's not impossible if Chegg were already in undisclosed crisis. My forecast remains in the 'very unlikely' range because no specific evidence suggests an imminent filing, and companies typically exhaust alternatives over longer periods.",
