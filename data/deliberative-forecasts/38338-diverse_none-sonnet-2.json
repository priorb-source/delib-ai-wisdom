    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises critical points I underweighted: (1) Morgan's history of flirting with runs but declining - this is crucial base rate information that should significantly lower the forecast; (2) There's no strategic imperative to announce by July 1, 2025 for a November 2026 race - wealthy self-funders don't face the same early fundraising pressures; (3) The short timeline favors status quo persistence. Forecaster 2's interpretation of the Politico article as near-determinative seems overly optimistic - 'laying out a campaign blueprint' is exploratory preparation, not commitment. Many politicians engage in such planning without ultimately announcing. The fact that three weeks have elapsed since the article without movement is a meaningful negative signal that Forecaster 2 doesn't adequately weight. However, I find Forecaster 3's 27% slightly too pessimistic given that the Politico article still represents genuine signal, and 25 days remains sufficient time for announcement if Morgan decides to proceed. The article wouldn't have been published without real substance.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward based primarily on Forecaster 3's arguments about Morgan's history and lack of deadline pressure. The absence of a strategic imperative to announce by July 1 for a 2026 race is particularly compelling - there's no Q2 fundraising deadline that matters for a self-funder, and Florida's 2026 gubernatorial race is 17 months away. Morgan's past pattern of exploring but not launching runs is important base rate information I underweighted. The three weeks of silence since the Politico article also suggests this may remain in exploratory phase. However, I'm not moving all the way to 27% because: (1) the Politico article remains meaningful evidence of serious consideration with public commitment to the idea, (2) 25 days is operationally sufficient for announcement if he's decided, and (3) we lack any evidence he's definitively decided against running. My updated forecast reflects stronger weight on base rates and strategic timing while still acknowledging the signal from recent reporting.",
