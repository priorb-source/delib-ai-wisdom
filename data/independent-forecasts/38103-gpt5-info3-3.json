  "information": "The exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro page continues to explicitly state that Tesla products are not eligible for the home EV charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The policy may persist, but the page is revised to brand-agnostic language (e.g., “U.S.-produced goods are ineligible”) or to a list-based approach that omits Tesla without naming it, or the program page is simplified/archived without the Tesla callout. In any of these cases, the page would not explicitly say Tesla is ineligible, so the question resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro maintains the March 12, 2025-style wording that directly names Tesla products as ineligible for the home charger rebate, or updates the page while still explicitly calling out Tesla as excluded.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro/BC government explicitly excluded Tesla products from CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates, citing a preference for Canadian goods and exclusion of U.S.-produced goods where practicable. With only about a month until July 1, abrupt reversals are unlikely.\n- Broader context: Per the research assistant, recent policy direction in Canada and B.C. has tilted toward domestic preference and trade retaliation (end of the federal iZEV rebates on Mar 31, 2025; tariffs on U.S.-made EVs; removal of U.S. liquor from B.C. government stores). This suggests a tightening, not loosening, stance, making a near-term policy reversal improbable.\n- Resolution nuance: The question resolves on the wording of the specific BC Hydro page. Even if the policy continues, a communications change that removes the explicit “Tesla is not eligible” line would make the answer No. That non-policy-but-wording risk keeps the probability from being higher.\n- Why not higher: (1) Legal/communications risk could push BC Hydro to stop naming a brand and instead use origin-based criteria, removing the explicit Tesla mention. (2) A page redesign or program update could drop the Tesla callout. (3) Less likely, a partial de-escalation or harmonization step could soften the exclusion language.\n- Why not lower: (1) The policy is fresh (March) and publicly justified; changing course within weeks would be unusual. (2) The political incentive currently favors maintaining a firm stance, including explicit messaging. (3) No public signals of reversal.\n- What would move me up: A BC Hydro or B.C. government communication reaffirming brand-specific exclusions, or site updates prior to July that continue to name Tesla explicitly.\n- What would move me down: Evidence of a legal challenge or trade de-escalation prompting neutral wording, a site refresh that removes brand names, or an announcement that the program page will be simplified/archived without the Tesla callout by July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
