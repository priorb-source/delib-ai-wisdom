    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that I had undervalued in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's detailed breakdown of potential remaining hurdles beyond the main license—such as hardware type approval, payment rail integration, and potential local partner requirements—was a cogent reminder that a license announcement is not the final step. Forecaster 3's contribution was even more impactful, introducing a powerful base rate argument that Starlink deployments in African countries have historically taken 4-8 months. This data point directly challenges the feasibility of the sub-1.5 month timeline required for a 'Yes' outcome. Their comparison to Nigeria and Rwanda, contrasted with the outlier case of Bangladesh, provided a much-needed statistical anchor that was missing from my more narrative-driven initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 85% to 65%. My initial forecast was overweighted on the strength of the high-level signals: the granting of the license, the public announcement from Elon Musk, and the welcoming ceremony by the Somali government. I interpreted this strong momentum as sufficient to overcome any logistical hurdles within the remaining six weeks. However, the other forecasters' arguments, particularly Forecaster 3's point about the 4-8 month base rate for African deployments, convinced me that my initial assessment was too optimistic and failed to incorporate historical precedent. The specific friction points raised by Forecaster 2 (type approval, payment logistics) provide plausible mechanisms for the types of delays that lead to these longer timelines. While I still believe the high-level political will and the use of laser backhaul (negating the need for a ground station) make an accelerated timeline more likely here than in a typical case, the base rate is too strong to ignore. I am not going as low as Forecaster 3's 15% because the combination of a CEO-level announcement and a public government ceremony signals this is an unusually high-priority launch, which I believe justifies positioning it as a likely exception to the regional base rate. My updated 65% forecast reflects a balance: a better-than-even chance driven by the strong positive signals, but with a substantial 35% probability of failure that acknowledges the historical timelines and the complex operational environment of Somalia.",
