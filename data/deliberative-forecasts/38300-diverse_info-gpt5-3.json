    "review": "Useful additions from both forecasters: (1) Forecaster 2 brings in concurrent hard-data proxies (manufacturing hours, rail carloads, electricity) and autos rebounding, all pointing to stability from April to May; they also flag LEI and core PPI softness as cautionary. (2) Forecaster 3 emphasizes inertia and the lack of a shock, while noting global demand risks (oil demand, China PMI). I hadn’t explicitly weighed the LEI/core PPI softness or the possibility that May 2024 might be a relatively high base versus April 2024, which could tighten the comparison. Both arguments are reasonable. I find the persistence/inertia case convincing, and the hard-data proxies, if flat-to-up, reduce the likelihood of a negative YoY. The downside points (LEI, PPI, global softness) are relevant but are more suggestive of gradual cooling than an abrupt, one-month reversal.",
    "rationale": "My prior forecast (88%) leaned on April’s +1.49% YoY and the notion that levels were at/near record highs, implying a buffer. The additional perspectives nudge me slightly lower: (a) if May 2024 was meaningfully stronger than April 2024, the YoY comparison tightens, raising the bar for May 2025 to stay positive; (b) the cited LEI decline and softer core PPI add some risk of broad slowing; and (c) the research assistant’s note of ongoing weakness in non-energy manufacturing remains a headwind. Against that, the lack of any identified May shock, the typical persistence in industrial production, and indications that key proxies and autos were stable-to-improving argue that a flip from +1.49% YoY to ≤0% in one month is still unlikely. Netting these, I trim modestly but remain clearly on Yes.",
