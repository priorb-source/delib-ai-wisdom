  "information": "The proposed VAT exemption has received public support from Ahmed Dangiwa, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from industry groups like the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) and the Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN). However, the broader tax reform package faces opposition from labor unions. The President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Festus Osifo, described the bills as 'anti-worker,' with union objections focusing on provisions such as the minimum taxable income and the proposed scrapping of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The broader tax reform package stalls amid union opposition and competing priorities (minimum wage talks, cost-of-living measures). The National Assembly does not complete bicameral passage and harmonization in time, or the President delays assent. Alternatively, leaders defer tax changes to a year-end Finance Act window, or any exemption is enacted after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration designates the measure as urgent, and the National Assembly fast-tracks either (a) the omnibus Tax Reforms Bill containing the VAT exemption, or (b) a narrow VAT (Amendment) bill carving out real estate transactions. Both chambers pass it and President Tinubu assents before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of May 5, no legislation has been enacted. With fewer than two months left, the default is that laws typically take longer than this to move through both chambers and receive assent. That tilts the base case toward No.\n- Signals for Yes: The proposed VAT exemption has explicit backing from the Housing Minister and industry groups (CORBON, HDAN), suggesting intra-executive alignment and stakeholder support. The ruling APC controls the National Assembly, so enactment is feasible if prioritized. A narrow, popular carve-out (housing affordability angle) could be separated and moved quickly.\n- Signals for No: The broader tax reform package is facing labor pushback (TUC labeling provisions anti-worker, e.g., on minimum taxable income and TETFUND). Contentious elements raise the risk of delay or rework and could crowd out a smooth, quick passage. Nigeria’s tax legislation often clusters in year-end Finance Acts, not mid-year, and the government is juggling high-salience issues (inflation, wage negotiations) that may take precedence.\n- Why not higher: Only ~8 weeks remain for full bicameral passage and presidential assent; there is visible opposition to the package; no clear evidence yet of fast-tracking or a standalone exemption bill already moving through readings/committee stages.\n- Why not lower: There is cabinet-level support and a plausible political incentive to claim a pro-housing win. The APC majority could decouple the exemption from controversial items and pass it swiftly if leadership designates urgency.\n- What would move me up: Reports of first/second readings completed in both chambers; committee reports adopted; harmonization scheduled; indications of a standalone VAT amendment focused on real estate; formal “certificate of urgency” from the Presidency; passage in one chamber.\n- What would move me down: News that the tax reform package is suspended or deferred to later in the year; National Assembly recess or disruptions from strikes; leadership signaling that tax changes (including VAT exemptions) will be bundled into a later Finance Act rather than enacted before July 1.\n- Summary of assistant’s info used: Minister and industry support for the exemption (positive), but union opposition to the broader package (negative), implying a mixed path with time constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe proposed VAT exemption has received public support from Ahmed Dangiwa, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from industry groups like the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) and the Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN). However, the broader tax reform package faces opposition from labor unions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
