  "information": "A poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The Trinidad and Tobago general election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, with results expected to be clear by April 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM), as the incumbent party which won a 22-19 majority in the 2020 election, retains a plurality of seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition United National Congress (UNC) galvanizes a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment, persuading the large bloc of undecided voters to vote for change and flipping several marginal constituencies to win a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage and strong party machinery to hold its base. As predicted by polling, vote-splitting in the two Tobago seats between the TPP and PDP allows the PNM to win both, providing the crucial margin for a plurality.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the PNM's structural advantages as the incumbent party, balanced against significant uncertainty indicated by polling data. The PNM currently holds a 22-19 majority, and incumbency provides a significant advantage in terms of resources and name recognition. A key factor in the PNM's favor comes from a Guardian TT poll, which suggests vote-splitting among opposition parties in the two Tobago seats will likely hand both to the PNM. In a tight election, these two seats could be decisive.\n\nHowever, the race is far from certain. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate remains undecided, a large enough group to swing the election in either direction. This uncertainty is heightened by a conflicting WIC News poll showing a massive, likely anomalous, 72% support for the opposition UNC. While this poll is probably an outlier, it may signal underlying momentum for the opposition that should not be completely disregarded. Given Trinidad and Tobago's first-past-the-post system, the election will be decided in a few marginal seats where a small swing in the popular vote can have an outsized impact on the seat count.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the large number of undecideds and the conflicting poll data introduce too much volatility to be highly confident in a PNM victory. If this bloc breaks decisively for the UNC, the PNM will lose.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the PNM holds the powerful advantage of incumbency and, more critically, has a clear, plausible path to victory through the vote-splitting in Tobago, which is a more concrete strategic factor than abstract polling momentum. The status quo is that the incumbent wins, and the evidence for a decisive wave of change is not yet clear enough to justify a lower forecast.\n\nI would increase my forecast if further credible polling showed the PNM consolidating its lead or the undecideds breaking in its favor. I would decrease it if credible polls showed a consistent UNC lead or if there were reports of a major last-minute scandal impacting the PNM government.",
