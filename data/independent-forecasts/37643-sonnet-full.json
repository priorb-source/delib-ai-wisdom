  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' on the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet, and the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiated rulemaking process begins June 30-July 2, but no final regulations are completed by July 1. The PSLF program continues to exist legally, albeit with proposed limitations. The Keep_Track moderators maintain the 'in progress' status because the program has not been formally terminated, only restricted or targeted with future rule changes. The tracker requires actual policy completion, not just proposed changes or executive orders signaling intent.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Keep_Track moderators decide that the combination of the March 7 executive order, the initiation of the rulemaking process, and the clear trajectory toward termination constitute sufficient progress to mark the objective as 'complete' before July 1. They interpret 'complete' broadly to mean that irreversible steps toward termination have been taken, even if the program hasn't been legally abolished yet. Alternatively, unexpected Congressional action passes legislation terminating PSLF in the next 1.5 months.",
    "rationale": "The probability of this resolving as Yes is low for several structural reasons. First, the timeline is extremely compressed - only 1.5 months remain until the deadline. Second, the research indicates that PSLF is established by federal statute and requires Congressional action to formally terminate. The alternative path through executive rulemaking has just begun, with the first negotiated rulemaking session scheduled for June 30-July 2 (straddling the deadline) and final rules not expected until later in 2025. Most importantly, despite an executive order being signed on March 7, 2025, the objective remains marked as 'in progress' on the tracker as of when this question was written. This strongly suggests the Keep_Track moderators require more than executive orders or proposed rule changes to mark an objective as 'complete' - they likely need actual policy implementation or legal termination. The fact that limiting eligibility (not terminating) through executive action hasn't been sufficient to mark it complete is telling. The base rate suggests that government policy changes, especially those requiring Congressional action or lengthy rulemaking processes, move slowly and would not complete in 1.5 months. For me to update higher, I would need evidence that: (1) the tracker uses a very loose definition of 'complete', (2) emergency Congressional action is imminent, or (3) there's precedent for the tracker marking objectives complete based on proposed rather than implemented changes. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation that the tracker explicitly requires formal legal termination before marking complete. Given the short timeline, procedural requirements, and current 'in progress' status despite prior executive action, I estimate an 18% probability of Yes.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
