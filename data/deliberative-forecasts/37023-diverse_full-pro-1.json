    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus on the underlying negative fundamentals: multi-decade high inflation expectations, rising unemployment fears, persistent policy uncertainty from tariffs, and significant downward momentum, with the April reading being the second-lowest on record. Forecaster 2's analysis (27%) strongly aligns with my initial assessment (25%), reinforcing the base case. Forecaster 3 (41%) introduced a crucial point that I had underweighted: given the index is already at a historical trough and the resolution threshold is merely '> 50.8', a small, technical rebound or statistical noise is all that is required for a 'Yes' outcome. Their argument that 'after sharp drops, subsequent months often stabilize or rebound modestly' is particularly compelling for a volatile survey-based index like this one. This point highlights that the question is not about a meaningful economic recovery, but about a marginal increase from an extreme low.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 25% was heavily weighted by the powerful negative momentum and the severe deterioration in underlying economic fundamentals. However, the deliberation has convinced me to adjust this probability upward. While the base case remains that the negative sentiment will persist, Forecaster 3's argument regarding the potential for a small 'mean-reversion' bounce from a historical low is very persuasive. The April drop was precipitous (11%), and it is plausible that after such a shock, the index could stabilize or recover by a small fraction of a point, which would be sufficient to resolve this question as 'Yes'. The pessimism drivers are largely priced into the current 50.8 number; for it to fall further would likely require fresh negative shocks. In the absence of those, a minor drift upward is a significant possibility. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 25% to 34% to better account for the probability of a small, technical rebound rather than a continuation of the sharp decline.",
