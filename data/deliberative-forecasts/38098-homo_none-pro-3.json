    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have reached a similar conclusion based on the same core evidence: the rapidly approaching deadline of July 1, 2025, and the complete lack of public signals (FEC filings, staff hires, exploratory committees) that are prerequisites for a major Senate campaign launch. We all agree that this makes a declaration of candidacy within the next month highly unlikely. The other two forecasters arrived at a slightly higher probability (15%) than my initial 10%. Their primary arguments for this slightly higher number, which I had not explicitly weighed, were that Ralph Norman's membership in the House Freedom Caucus makes him an ideologically motivated challenger more likely to take on an establishment incumbent, and that a campaign launch could have been planned in secret, with the one-month window being sufficient time to execute the announcement rather than prepare the entire campaign from scratch. I find these arguments to be valid and persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 10% to 15%. The reasoning from the other forecasters has convinced me that I slightly underweighted the possibility of a surprise announcement. My initial analysis was heavily anchored on the absence of public evidence. While this remains the strongest factor pointing to a 'No' resolution, their points about Norman's specific profile as a Freedom Caucus member and the plausibility of a pre-planned, secret campaign preparation are well-taken. A motivated, anti-establishment challenger is more likely to defy conventional campaign rollout timelines. The possibility that the groundwork has been laid privately and Norman is simply waiting for an opportune moment in June cannot be dismissed and warrants a slightly higher probability than I initially assigned. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast by 5 percentage points to align with the consensus of 15%, which I now believe more accurately reflects the small but real chance of a surprise declaration.",
