  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The resolution period is from May 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025. The final outcome will be known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current status is a three-month period of inactivity on the News page. If this trend continues without any new catalyst, Virgin Galactic will fail to make a post in May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic releases its Q1 2025 financial results in early May, as is typical for publicly traded companies, and publishes the corresponding press release on its News page. This is the most likely scenario for a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current period of inactivity extends through May. The company may release its Q1 earnings, but either delays the release until June or decides not to publicize it on the main News page, reserving that space for operational milestones that do not occur in May.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on analyzing both the recent posting frequency and predictable corporate events. The research assistant's report correctly highlights sporadic posting history, including a recent three-month gap from February to April 2025. This establishes a status quo of inactivity. However, this is strongly counteracted by a high-probability, scheduled event. As a publicly traded company, Virgin Galactic is expected to release its Q1 2025 earnings report in early May, consistent with its reporting schedule in previous years (e.g., May 7, 2024, for Q1 2024). Historically, the company has consistently published these earnings releases on its News page. This recurring corporate event serves as a powerful catalyst for a new post, outweighing the recent lack of ad-hoc news. My forecast is not lower than 10% because there is a small chance the company could alter its communications strategy, posting the earnings only in its investor relations section, or that an unforeseen issue delays the report until June. My forecast is not higher because ignoring the near-certainty of a scheduled Q1 earnings announcement in May would be a significant oversight. I would increase the probability of 'Yes' if there were an official announcement delaying the Q1 earnings report into June. I would decrease the probability if the company confirmed a May date for the earnings release.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
