    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 present diametrically opposed views. Forecaster 2 anchors heavily on the Electoral Calculus projection, treating it as strong evidence that should push the probability above 50%. Forecaster 3 emphasizes structural barriers - FPTP seat conversion inefficiency, organizational deficits, and the critical question of candidate coverage - to argue for a very low probability.\n\nForcaster 3 raises several arguments I underweighted: (1) The candidate slate question is crucial - if Reform doesn't field candidates in all divisions, they literally cannot win most seats, and I have no evidence they have full coverage. (2) FPTP systematically punishes new parties with inefficiently distributed support, producing many second-place finishes rather than wins. (3) The Electoral Calculus piece is a model projection, not traditional polling data, making assumptions about tactical voting and ground game that may not hold.\n\nForecaster 2's core argument - that we should heavily weight a specific prediction for this race - has merit, but overestimates the reliability of model-based local projections and doesn't adequately engage with why Reform's national polling might not translate to seat plurality at the local level.\n\nThe most decisive consideration is one I didn't adequately emphasize: local elections require organization, incumbents, and candidate quality. We're now ~10 days from the election, and if Reform truly had the infrastructure to win control, we'd likely see more concrete evidence - candidate announcements, campaign visibility, additional polling confirmation. The absence of such evidence, combined with FPTP's historical punishment of new parties, suggests the Electoral Calculus projection may overstate Reform's chances.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 30% to 18%. The key factors driving this revision are:\n\n1. **Candidate coverage uncertainty**: Without confirmation that Reform has fielded candidates in most or all divisions, they face a hard ceiling on possible seats. This is a binary constraint I didn't emphasize enough.\n\n2. **FPTP seat conversion**: Historical evidence strongly suggests Reform's vote share will convert to seats at a poor ratio. Even 25-30% of votes might yield only 15-20% of seats if support is geographically spread.\n\n3. **Model vs. poll distinction**: The Electoral Calculus projection is not raw polling data but a model making assumptions about turnout, tactical voting, and local factors. Such models have historically overstated insurgent party performance in local elections.\n\n4. **Proximity to election**: At ~10 days out, if Reform had the organization to win control, we'd expect more concrete evidence - confirmed candidate slates, local polling, visible campaign infrastructure. The lack of additional corroborating evidence is informative.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as low as 7% because: (1) Kent's pro-Brexit demographics do favor Reform; (2) Conservative collapse nationally is historically unprecedented; (3) The Electoral Calculus projection shouldn't be entirely dismissed; (4) We're in unusual political circumstances where historical patterns may partially break down.\n\n18% reflects meaningful skepticism about Reform's capacity to convert national sentiment into local government control while acknowledging non-trivial probability in an unprecedented political environment.",
