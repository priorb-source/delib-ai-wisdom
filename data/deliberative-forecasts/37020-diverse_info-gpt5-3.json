    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully surfaces the risk that ACM voters could be cautious about fully embracing a recent crossover, but I find their reliance on Post Malone’s 0/18 Grammy record weak as a predictive signal here—the ACM electorate is different, and cross-institution conversion rates are poor predictors. Their examples of crossover wins are not specific to the ACM and, as framed, don’t strongly establish an ACM-specific barrier. Forecaster 3 adds potentially material new info (claiming 5 nominations including Album of the Year and three for the Wallen collab), and correctly highlights that multiple nominations meaningfully increase the chance of at least one win; they also note strong competition. However, the exact count and categories for Malone’s nominations conflict with the question background (4 nominations), so I treat the extra nomination and Album nod as unconfirmed. Both forecasters agree the collaboration with Morgan Wallen is a prime path, which aligns with my prior view. Net: F2’s argument nudges caution on voter sentiment; F3’s (if accurate) would slightly raise odds. Given the uncertainty about the 5th nomination, neither pushes me to make a substantial change.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: With four nominations, the chance of at least one win is materially above a single-category hit rate, even accounting for correlation. The most plausible wins are around the Morgan Wallen collaboration (Music Event/Visual Media) and possibly Single/Song, given the track’s outsized commercial footprint. The ACMs are relatively open to rewarding blockbuster collaborations, and commercial success tends to matter. Risks: This is a very competitive cycle with multiple heavyweights; Single/Song can cluster around the same rival act; and voters could be hesitant to grant a newcomer/crossover multiple marquee wins. I discount the Grammy shutout as a cross-domain predictor. If Forecaster 3’s additional nomination and Album nod are verified, I would shade this up a couple of points; if not, my prior stands. With awards about two weeks away and no strong new signal of sweeping momentum or backlash, I maintain a modestly optimistic stance driven by multiple live paths to a win, especially for the Wallen collaboration.",
