  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.\n\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.\n\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~20 days; DOL releases the week-ended Jun 21 figure on Thu, Jun 26, 2025 (FRED ICSA will reflect that value)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (>220k). Recent prints are 239k and 247k with a 4‑week average ~235k.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Temporary factors behind late-May elevation unwind quickly (e.g., state-specific spikes in MI/CA fade; seasonal quirks normalize), pushing weekly claims down into the 205–220k range by Jun 21 despite otherwise softening indicators.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The softening labor trend persists: layoffs and hiring freezes keep initial claims elevated in the 230–260k range, with continued claims steady-to-up and no sharp state-level pullbacks before Jun 21.",
    "rationale": "Context: The latest initial claims were 247k for the week ending May 31 (highest in eight months) and 239k the week prior. The 4‑week moving average is ~235k. Challenger cuts, weak ADP (+37k), and Beige Book/ISM employment softness all point to a cooling labor market. That places the near-term claims baseline above the 220k threshold.\n\nStatus quo weighting: Given the 4‑week average at 235k and the most recent print at 247k, the default expectation is that claims remain above 220k into late June. Weekly claims are noisy, but moving from 247k to ≤220k within three weeks would require a sizable decline (~27k), which is possible but not the modal outcome absent a clear one-off distortion.\n\nWhy not higher: Weekly claims can mean-revert quickly if late-May increases were driven by temporary, state-specific factors or seasonal-adjustment quirks. If state data show broad declines over the next two Thursdays (weeks ending Jun 7 and Jun 14), the Jun 21 print could edge toward the low 220s or slightly below.\n\nWhy not lower: The trend and breadth of macro signals (higher announced layoffs, weakening surveys) argue against a swift return to ≤220k by Jun 21. The 4‑week average above 230k provides inertia, and revisions are typically small.\n\nUpdate triggers: I would raise the probability if the next release(s) show claims staying ≥230k and continued claims rising; any notable new layoff announcements would reinforce that. I would lower it if initial claims for Jun 7 and/or Jun 14 drop sharply (e.g., to ~220k or below) with state-level breadth, suggesting the late-May spike was transitory.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
