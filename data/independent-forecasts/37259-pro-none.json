    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Greenland remains a self-governing constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark, and no date for an independence referendum is announced before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly elected government, led by the Siumut party which favors a gradual approach to independence, focuses its initial months on economic issues and consolidating its administration. They adhere to their platform of building economic self-sufficiency before considering a referendum, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any such announcement being made.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected fractures within the new governing coalition lead to a political crisis. To shore up support or as part of a concession to a more radical coalition partner, the Premier of Greenland makes a surprise announcement, scheduling an independence referendum for a date several years in the future. This move is largely symbolic but satisfies the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome, primarily due to two factors: the political platform of the recently elected government and the extremely short timeframe. \n\nFirst, the background information from Reuters indicates that 'gradualists' won the March 2025 election. A gradualist approach to independence inherently prioritizes economic development and self-sufficiency over a swift political break. Announcing a referendum within their first four months in office would be a direct contradiction of this mandate. Governments typically act in line with their core campaign platforms, especially in the immediate aftermath of an election. \n\nSecond, the deadline is less than two months away. Scheduling a referendum on an issue of this magnitude is a complex process that usually involves significant political negotiation, legislative action, and public preparation. It is highly improbable that a new government would initiate and conclude this process in such a short period. The status quo, in this case, is a very powerful force.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., 1%) because politics can be unpredictable. A 'Yes' could occur due to a low-probability 'black swan' event, such as a severe political crisis within the coalition or a sudden, dramatic shift in public opinion that forces the government's hand. An announcement is also a less costly action than actually holding the vote, so it could theoretically be used as a political tool. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the available evidence points overwhelmingly against such an announcement. The election result is the most significant recent event, and it signals a clear public preference for a slow and steady path, making a rushed referendum announcement politically illogical for the ruling party. \n\nI would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if credible news emerged of a breakdown in the governing coalition or if the Premier began making public statements suggesting an accelerated timeline for a referendum. Conversely, I would lower it further if the new government releases a formal multi-year plan that makes no mention of a referendum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
