    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall status is currently 'Active', and the question resolves as 'No' if it remains 'Active' on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical or administrative delays, either within Cargill or at the USDA, prevent the recall from being officially closed. For instance, Cargill may have difficulty confirming that all affected product has been recovered and disposed of, or the USDA's verification process might take longer than expected, pushing the status change past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill Kitchen Solutions efficiently completes all recall effectiveness checks, confirms the disposition of the recalled product, and submits the necessary paperwork to the USDA. The agency reviews and accepts the documentation, changing the recall status from 'Active' to 'Closed' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factors influencing this forecast are the type of recall, the company involved, and the timeframe provided. The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, providing a total window of just over three months until the July 1, 2025 deadline. For a large and experienced company like Cargill, this is generally a sufficient period to manage a recall for a chemical contaminant, which is often logistically simpler to resolve than a widespread microbiological issue. Cargill has a strong financial and reputational incentive to close this matter expeditiously. The status quo is that the recall is 'Active', as all recalls are at their outset. However, the standard process is for recalls to be closed once the company demonstrates to FSIS that the product is no longer in commerce. My probability is not higher because bureaucratic and administrative delays are always a possibility in processes involving large corporations and government agencies. A slight delay in paperwork or verification could easily push the closure date past the deadline. My probability is not lower because the three-month period is a reasonable and often ample amount of time for this specific type of recall to be fully executed and administratively closed. For me to update my forecast lower, I would need to see reports of complications, such as a wider-than-expected distribution of the product. To update higher, an official statement from Cargill or the USDA indicating the recall actions were nearly complete would be necessary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
