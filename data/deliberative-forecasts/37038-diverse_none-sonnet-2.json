    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling technical and procedural arguments I had underweighted. Forecaster 3's insight about HTS structure is particularly crucial: the harmonized tariff schedule typically doesn't impose uniform ad valorem rates like '17% for Israel' across all products. When the US removes trade preferences, it reverts to product-specific Column 1 or Column 2 rates, not bespoke uniform percentages. This makes the specific '17%' listing extremely unusual from a technical standpoint. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the FTA's congressional backing and the short timeframe. Both note the absence of any current evidence (USTR announcements, Federal Register notices, USITC supplements) that would signal such a change is imminent. I may have also overstated the relevance of the Times of Israel article without verifying its publication date - if it's older than I assumed, that further weakens the case. However, I remain slightly less confident than the 3% forecast because: (1) the question's oddly specific '17%' figure suggests there may be context about a real proposal that I'm missing; (2) the resolution criteria's note about suspended status introduces a marginal tail risk; (3) current geopolitical volatility creates non-trivial uncertainty even for low-probability events.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the technical arguments, I am updating my forecast significantly downward. The most persuasive new evidence is that the HTS structural framework makes a uniform '17%' rate for Israel highly atypical. Standard practice would be removing FTA benefits and reverting to product-specific rates, not creating a blanket percentage. Combined with: (1) complete absence of formal procedural steps (no USTR/USITC announcements), (2) only 38 days remaining, (3) strong political constraints on US-Israel policy changes, and (4) lack of current evidence beyond an older article, the probability of this specific outcome is low. I'm settling at 10% rather than 3-7% primarily due to: (a) the question's specificity suggesting possible knowledge of a real proposal I haven't identified, (b) tail risk from geopolitical volatility, and (c) the resolution criteria allowing suspended listings. If evidence emerged of formal tariff proposals or if officials explicitly reaffirmed the FTA status, I would adjust further.",
