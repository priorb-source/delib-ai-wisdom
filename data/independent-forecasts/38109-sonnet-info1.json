  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days - the outcome will be fully determined by June 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Kalshi continues offering daily MLB markets throughout June as they have been since April 17, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi stops offering MLB markets on at least one day in June due to legal/regulatory intervention from the court case mentioned, technical issues, business decision changes, or a day when no MLB games are scheduled despite being mid-season",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi maintains its current practice of offering daily MLB prediction markets throughout all 30 days of June 2025, with at least one MLB game available to bet on each day during the regular season",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Kalshi has been consistently offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025 - approximately 6 weeks of established operation. This isn't a new or experimental offering. The research assistant reports that sports contracts account for over 80% of weekend trading volume, providing massive business incentive to maintain these markets. Kalshi has demonstrated operational capability handling large volumes ($27M for Super Bowl, $500M for March Madness). June is mid-MLB season, so games should occur nearly every day with no All-Star break (which typically occurs in July). The company is CFTC-regulated and appears to have proper authorization for these markets. The main downside risks are: (1) the pending court case could result in regulatory intervention, though this seems unlikely to happen suddenly in June given established operations; (2) technical or operational failures, though these would need to last a full day; (3) potential MLB schedule gaps, though these are rare in June. The 6-week track record of consistent daily markets is strong evidence for continuation. I'm not higher (95%+) because the legal uncertainty and possibility of unexpected disruptions keep some meaningful probability of failure. I'm not lower (70-80%) because the established pattern, strong financial incentives, and regulatory approval create a robust baseline expectation of continuation.",
