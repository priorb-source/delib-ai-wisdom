    "review": "The other forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that largely converge with my own reasoning, arriving at 18-20% probability - a remarkably tight range suggesting we're identifying the same core dynamics. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the EU antitrust investigation angle I hadn't explicitly mentioned, and makes a strong point about governments avoiding drastic unilateral actions 'unless all other options are exhausted.' Forecaster 3 offers the most procedurally detailed analysis, particularly noting supplier incentive structures - BOTAŞ likely prefers leveraging debt over cancellation since termination forfeits future revenue and collection leverage. This is an excellent point I hadn't fully developed. Forecaster 3 also raises the valid consideration that caretaker or transitional governments (relevant given Bulgaria's political instability) tend to avoid large litigious moves. Both forecasters appropriately note that even in financial distress, intermediate steps like default notices and service suspensions typically precede outright cancellation. The convergence on 18-20% across three independent analyses using similar reasoning pathways gives me confidence this range appropriately captures the balance between acute financial/political pressure and the substantial legal, diplomatic, and practical barriers to cancellation within 25 days.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find no compelling new evidence that would significantly shift my forecast. The key arguments reinforcing the lower probability include: (1) supplier incentive analysis - BOTAŞ benefits more from leveraging debt than cancelling; (2) intermediate procedural steps typically precede cancellation; (3) caretaker government caution in Bulgaria's unstable political environment. These factors slightly strengthen the case for status quo. However, the counterarguments remain salient: the resolution criteria explicitly counts unilateral announcements even if disputed, Bulgargaz's financial situation is genuinely critical, and high-level political engagement (PM to President) indicates real urgency. The 25-day window remains the dominant constraint - this is simply insufficient time for the complex legal, diplomatic, and administrative processes that typically accompany international energy agreement terminations, even under duress. The remarkable convergence of three independent forecasts at 18-20% validates this range as appropriately calibrated to balance the competing forces.",
