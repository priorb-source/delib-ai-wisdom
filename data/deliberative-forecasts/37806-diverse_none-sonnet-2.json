    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' requirement creates a substantial specificity hurdle. They correctly note that official government texts typically use terms like 'diversity immigrant program' or 'DV category' rather than the colloquial 'Diversity Visa.' This is a strong argument supported by their claim about precedent—that explicit mentions in presidential actions are uncommon even when administrations target the program. Forecaster 3 also provides more concrete details on agenda priorities (DV is only ~55,000 visas annually vs. larger border/asylum issues) and political calculus (limited immediate impact relative to litigation risk). Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine at 30%, emphasizing timing constraints and bureaucratic processes. The question is whether the wording specificity constraint and precedent argument justify dropping from 30% to 10%. I find Forecaster 3's wording argument compelling but not fully decisive—presidential actions can use colloquial language, especially when making political points. The phrase 'Diversity Visa' appears in the question background articles and public discourse, suggesting it could appear in an action specifically targeting this program for political messaging purposes.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward but not to 10%. The wording specificity constraint is more significant than I initially weighted—government documents do often use technical terminology like 'diversity immigrant program' rather than 'Diversity Visa.' This substantially reduces the probability that even a relevant presidential action would use the exact required phrase. However, I'm not convinced this constraint is so severe as to drop to 10% because: (1) Trump's communications style favors politically charged, colloquial language over bureaucratic terminology; (2) an action specifically targeting this program for political purposes might deliberately use the public-facing term 'Diversity Visa' for messaging impact; (3) the phrase appears prominently in advocacy and media coverage Trump likely consumes. I'm also giving weight to the limited time remaining and competing priorities, but maintaining that Trump's documented opposition and propensity for immigration executive actions keeps meaningful probability alive. Balancing the strong wording constraint against the possibility of deliberate colloquial usage, I'm settling at 20%.",
