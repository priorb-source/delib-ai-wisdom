    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks. G7 summits typically occur in mid-to-late June, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. According to the Times of India article, India has not received an invitation to the G7 Summit, while Canada has already invited Australia and Ukraine as guest nations.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India, likely due to ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries stemming from 2023-2024 disputes. Alternatively, an invitation comes too late for Modi to adjust his schedule, or India receives but declines the invitation given the strained bilateral relationship.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India as a guest nation in the coming days, possibly as part of a diplomatic reconciliation effort or under pressure from other G7 members. Modi accepts and makes the necessary scheduling adjustments to attend in person.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. Key factors: (1) We're already on June 3rd and India hasn't been invited yet, while other guest nations (Australia, Ukraine) have been. G7 summits require extensive security and logistical planning, making late invitations problematic. (2) Recent diplomatic tensions between Canada and India over allegations related to the Hardeep Singh Nijjar case likely explain the absence of an invitation. (3) While India has attended G7 summits as a guest in the past under different host countries, Canada as the 2025 host appears to have excluded India. (4) The research assistant found no additional information suggesting any development toward an invitation. The probability is not lower because diplomatic situations can shift rapidly, and there's technically still time for an invitation and attendance - stranger things have happened in international relations. The probability is not higher because the combination of no invitation yet, strained bilateral relations, and limited time makes attendance very unlikely. I would update significantly higher (to 60-80%) if news breaks of Canada extending an invitation within the next few days. I would update to near 0% if the summit dates are confirmed for early/mid-June with still no invitation, or if either government makes statements ruling out Modi's attendance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
