    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days until April 30, 2025",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "The state of emergency expires as scheduled on April 29, 2025 and is not extended or renewed. The power situation improves sufficiently that the government determines emergency powers are no longer needed, or they decide to address the situation through non-emergency measures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The power crisis persists or worsens, prompting the government to extend the state of emergency beyond April 29 to include April 30 and potentially later dates. Alternatively, a new state of emergency could be declared for a different or related issue.",
    "rationale": "The critical detail is timing: the current state of emergency is scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, exactly one day before the resolution date of April 30. This makes the status quo outcome strongly favor No. For Yes to occur, the government would need to actively extend or renew the emergency declaration within the next 9 days. While energy crises can be persistent and states of emergency are sometimes extended when underlying problems remain unresolved, we have no information about: (1) whether the power situation has improved, (2) any government statements about extension plans, or (3) the current status of the emergency. The research assistant provided no additional information. Given the principle that the world changes slowly and status quo should be weighted heavily, the default expectation is that the scheduled end date will hold unless there's evidence otherwise. However, the proximity of the scheduled end to the resolution date (just one day apart) and the nature of infrastructure crises that can require extended responses provides some non-trivial probability of extension. My forecast is not higher because we lack any evidence of extension plans and the status quo is expiration. It's not lower because energy crises can genuinely require extended emergency measures and 9 days is sufficient time for an extension announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
