    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this forecast, leading to very similar low-probability assessments. We all identified the extremely short timeframe (one month), the complete lack of public preparatory signals for a Senate campaign (e.g., FEC filings, staff hires), and the high degree of inertia favouring the status quo as the primary reasons for a likely 'No' resolution. Forecaster 2's reasoning reinforced my own, particularly by framing the challenge in terms of low base rates for unseating incumbents and flagging Rep. Norman's Freedom Caucus membership as a specific factor preventing the odds from being zero. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly persuasive by highlighting a point I had not fully weighted: the key news article floating Norman's candidacy is from September 2023, and the subsequent lack of media follow-up suggests the idea lost momentum. This is a powerful piece of negative evidence, not just a neutral absence of information.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis, which produced a 15% forecast, was heavily influenced by the lack of positive evidence for an imminent campaign launch within the short remaining timeframe. The other forecasters' analyses confirmed this view and, in one case, strengthened it. I found Forecaster 3's argument that the story has effectively gone cold since it was first reported in late 2023 to be particularly compelling. If a serious challenge were being planned for this cycle, one would expect the chatter and preparatory signals to increase over time, not disappear for over a year and a half. This specific lack of momentum strengthens the case that no announcement is planned for the immediate future. The arguments presented have convinced me to be slightly more confident in the 'No' outcome. Consequently, I am lowering my forecast to better reflect the increased weight of evidence against a declaration before the July 1st deadline.",
