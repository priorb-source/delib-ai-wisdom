    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified the core tension between Reform UK's clear momentum in individual polls and the structural inertia of the Politico poll-of-polls aggregator, which is the resolution source. We all agree on the high bar set by the resolution criteria (overcoming a nearly 20-point deficit to establish a 4-point lead) and the role of the May 1st elections as a major potential catalyst. The primary difference lies in the weight assigned to the possibility of a rapid political realignment overcoming the aggregator's inertia. My initial forecast was the most conservative, Forecaster 2 was slightly more bullish, and Forecaster 3 was the most optimistic. I found the other forecasters' reasoning convincing, particularly their emphasis on how a major electoral shock today could create a 'bandwagon effect' or 'cement the surge,' forcing the aggregator to move much faster than it normally would. They didn't present new evidence, but they framed the dynamic potential of the situation in a way that made me reconsider my heavy anchoring on the aggregator's historical behavior. I now believe I under-weighted the potential for a feedback loop where a strong election result generates a media narrative that in turn drives a rapid, system-wide shift in polling across all pollsters, overwhelming the aggregator's usual smoothing function.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. My initial forecast of 12% was heavily anchored on the mathematical difficulty of Reform UK overcoming a nearly 20-point deficit in a poll-of-polls aggregator and establishing a 4-point lead within a two-month timeframe. While I maintain this is the largest barrier to a 'Yes' resolution, the other forecasters have convinced me that I underestimated the potential for the May 1st elections to act as a catalyst for a rapid, non-linear shift in public opinion. The concept of a 'bandwagon effect' following a strong Reform performance is compelling. If they win the by-election and exceed expectations in local councils, the ensuing media narrative could significantly accelerate voter shift, causing all subsequent polls to show a new reality. In such a scenario of systemic change, the aggregator's lag, while still present, would be less impactful than in a period of normal fluctuation. The research showing that 36% of adults are 'considering' Reform points to a high ceiling for potential growth that could be realized quickly under the right conditions. I am therefore increasing my forecast to acknowledge this heightened possibility of a political shockwave. I am not moving as high as Forecaster 3 (28%) because I believe the 4-point lead requirement, on top of just reaching first place, remains an exceptionally high and distinct hurdle. My new forecast splits the difference between my original position and my colleagues', reflecting an increased but still skeptical view of this historic political shift occurring within the specified constraints.",
