    "review": "My initial forecast was critically flawed because I misinterpreted the prompt's example text about January 2025 data as a given baseline, leading me to assume a large 11-point lead for Erdoğan. Both other forecasters correctly identified that no baseline data was provided, highlighting the central uncertainty of the question. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling. Their approach of using publicly available external information to establish a prior—that Erdoğan has historically maintained a modest but consistent lead over Sánchez in Morning Consult's tracker—is a much more sound methodology than my faulty assumption or Forecaster 2's heavier reliance on pure uncertainty. Forecaster 2's point about the full January-to-July period being relevant is valid, but with only one month left, Forecaster 3's focus on the inertia of a likely existing gap is more persuasive. The combination of a smaller-than-assumed lead for Erdoğan and the short timeframe are the key drivers.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward from 15% to 20%. The primary reason is correcting my initial, erroneous assumption of a large 11-point lead for Erdoğan. Based on the other forecasters' correct reading of the prompt and Forecaster 3's external research, the more likely scenario is that Erdoğan started 2025 with a modest lead (perhaps 2-5 points) over Sánchez. A smaller gap makes a crossover by July 1st substantially more plausible, warranting a higher probability for 'Yes'.\n\nHowever, I am remaining slightly more pessimistic than Forecaster 3 (23%) and much more so than Forecaster 2 (45%). My reasoning is that the current political context in Spain presents significant headwinds for Sánchez. The ongoing controversies surrounding the Catalan amnesty law and investigations involving his wife are likely to suppress his approval rating or even cause it to decline in the final month before resolution. By contrast, while Turkey's economy is a challenge for Erdoğan, his approval has shown considerable resilience. Therefore, while the starting gap is smaller than I first thought, I believe the short-term political dynamics favor Erdoğan maintaining his lead. My updated 20% forecast reflects a balance between the increased possibility of a crossover due to a smaller gap and the notable political risks facing Sánchez.",
