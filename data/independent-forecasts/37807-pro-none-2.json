    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 11 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The USDA webpage for \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" continues to specifically list \"snack foods\" as an eligible category of items. This results in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the policy goals of a new administration, the USDA Secretary directs the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to rapidly update its public guidance. The FNS edits the webpage to remove the specific phrase \"snack foods\" as part of a broader push to discourage the purchase of unhealthy items with SNAP benefits, successfully completing this change before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite a potential desire by new USDA leadership to restrict certain food purchases, the immense bureaucratic inertia, procedural requirements for changing federal program guidance, and the short timeframe prevent any changes from being implemented and published on the website by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The webpage remains unchanged.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Federal government regulations and even the text on official guidance webpages change very slowly. The period between today (May 20, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is less than two months. This is an exceptionally short timeframe to implement any policy change, even a cosmetic one, for a program as large and complex as SNAP.\n\nThe primary driver for a potential 'No' outcome is the stated intention of potential officials in a new administration, as noted in the provided background article. However, translating political intentions into official agency action is a lengthy process. Altering SNAP eligibility rules, or even the official public interpretation of those rules, would likely require a formal rulemaking process, legal review, and multiple layers of internal approval. Such a process cannot be completed in six weeks.\n\nThe forecast is not 100% because there is a small possibility that a highly motivated political appointee at the USDA could bypass normal procedures and order a rapid, cosmetic change to the website's text as a symbolic action or a messaging tool. This would be unusual but is not impossible within the realm of executive branch action.\n\nThe forecast is not lower (e.g., 80%) because the practical and procedural barriers to this change are immense. The history of attempts to restrict what can be bought with SNAP benefits is fraught with political controversy and implementation challenges, which makes a rapid, successful change extremely improbable. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see concrete evidence that this specific change has been officially fast-tracked within the USDA, such as a leaked internal memo or a public directive from the Secretary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
