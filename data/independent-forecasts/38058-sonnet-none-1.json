    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue to appear on at least one of the two front pages every day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant political and economic story throughout the period. Trump continues making tariff-related announcements, trade negotiations dominate headlines, and economic impacts of tariffs generate ongoing front-page coverage. Both newspapers consistently include tariff coverage somewhere on their front pages, even if not always the lead story.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, significant domestic political development) dominates both newspapers' front pages for a day. Alternatively, tariff news temporarily quiets during a slow news cycle, or both papers coincidentally focus their front pages on different major stories that don't involve tariffs on the same day.",
    "rationale": "The resolution window runs from May 19 to July 1, 2025 - a 43-day period of which 7 days have already passed. The question only requires ONE day where both papers omit 'tariff' or 'tariffs' from their front pages. The question background emphasizes that tariffs are currently a highly prominent topic due to Trump's policies, described as his 'renewed love' for this taxation form. This suggests tariffs are dominating news coverage currently. However, several factors support a moderate probability of YES: (1) Over 43 days, even dominant stories occasionally get displaced by breaking news; (2) Major unrelated events (international incidents, natural disasters, major political developments) could monopolize front-page coverage; (3) Weekend editions sometimes have different editorial priorities; (4) We need only ONE day out of 43, not sustained absence. Factors supporting NO: (1) The question describes tariffs as a major ongoing story; (2) Both papers must omit it on the SAME day, which is more difficult than just one paper; (3) The front page includes multiple sections beyond top headlines - tariffs could appear in business/finance sections; (4) Economic and political impacts of tariff policies generate ongoing newsworthy developments. The status quo suggests continued front-page presence given the topic's current prominence, but the long time window and low bar (just one day) create reasonable probability of at least one coincidental omission. I would revise upward if evidence showed tariff news declining or major competing stories emerging. I would revise downward if tariff negotiations intensified or economic impacts accelerated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
