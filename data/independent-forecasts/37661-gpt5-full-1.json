  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until end of June 30, 2025, since the question resolves on availability before July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BTRC takes several weeks to review/approve Starlink’s tariff plan and related consumer pricing and terms. Customs/type-approval or import logistics for terminals slow initial shipments. To avoid regulatory risk or optics amid a U.S. political probe, either SpaceX or Bangladeshi authorities wait for formal approvals and local documentation before opening orders. The Starlink map remains at Coming Soon or Targeting 2025 through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BTRC approves Starlink’s tariff plan in late May or early June; SpaceX enables orders for at least part of Bangladesh (no local gateway needed due to laser backhaul). The Starlink map flips to Available for at least one area in Bangladesh by mid-to-late June, aligned with prior public targets for a May/June launch.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short but manageable. Licenses were granted April 30, 2025; Starlink registered with BIDA on March 29; a trial ran April 9; officials and SpaceX signaled a May launch. That sequence indicates strong political will and technical readiness. The remaining gating item appears to be BTRC approval of Starlink’s tariff plan. Historically, Starlink’s license-to-availability lag has ranged from under 3 months to over a year. Bangladesh would be on the fast end if it turns Available by July 1 (about two months post-license). Factors pushing toward Yes: clear government invitation; completed licensing; an already demonstrated trial; no requirement to wait for a local gateway thanks to inter-satellite links; and public expectations for a near-term launch. Factors pushing toward No: administrative friction on tariff/pricing approval, possible device type-approval/import steps, local distribution and tax set-up, and some risk that the U.S. Senate inquiry nudges either side to proceed more cautiously. Importantly, the status quo is No—maps only flip when orders are actually enabled, and bureaucratic delays are common. I give extra weight to that inertia. Why not higher than my forecast? Because we still lack confirmation that the tariff plan is approved, and slipping a few weeks would push past the deadline. Why not lower? Because most substantive regulatory hurdles (licensing, permission to operate and import) appear cleared; the government is publicly supportive; and Starlink can technically activate quickly. What would move me up: official BTRC tariff/pricing approval; reports of terminals clearing customs; local reseller agreements; SpaceX or government statements with specific June launch dates. What would move me down: news that tariff approval is delayed or conditioned on further studies, any requirement for a local gateway or data localization before commercial service, legal challenges from local ISPs, or indications that SpaceX is pausing foreign activations amid the U.S. probe.",
