    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves based on data for the week ending May 30, 2025, and today is April 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If current trends continue, the outcome would likely be Yes. The referenced article indicates the US rig count has been falling for three consecutive weeks, suggesting a downward trajectory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rig count remains at or above 583. This would occur if drilling activity stabilizes or increases due to factors such as: oil/gas prices rising significantly, improved drilling economics making more projects viable, or the current count being substantially above 583 (e.g., 620+) such that even continued modest declines wouldn't breach the threshold by late May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rig count falls below 583. This would occur if: the recent downward trend continues for the next 5 weeks, oil/gas prices remain weak or decline further, economic conditions continue to suppress drilling demand, or the current count is already close to or below 583 and remains there.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge is that while we know the rig count has been falling for three consecutive weeks, we don't have the exact current number. Historical context shows US rig counts have ranged widely (450-900+) in recent years based on commodity prices and drilling economics.\n\nThe recent three-week declining trend is significant and suggests underlying weakness in the drilling sector, likely driven by softer oil/gas prices or reduced drilling economics. However, rig counts tend to be somewhat sticky in the short term - they don't typically swing dramatically week-to-week unless there's a major catalyst.\n\nWith only 5 weeks until resolution, this is a relatively short forecast horizon. If the current count is in the 590-610 range, the recent downward momentum could plausibly push it below 583. If it's already below 583, it would likely remain there. However, if the current count is significantly above 583 (say 620+), five weeks may not be enough time for sufficient decline.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) we lack precise current data, (2) rig counts can stabilize quickly if market conditions shift, (3) five weeks allows limited time for major changes, and (4) any positive oil price movement could halt the decline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) the established three-week declining trend is meaningful, (2) momentum often persists in drilling activity, and (3) there's no indication of factors that would reverse the trend.\n\nI would update higher (toward No) if: oil/gas prices surge, current data shows the count is significantly above 583, or the declining trend reverses. I would update lower (toward Yes) if: the current count is revealed to be close to or below 583, oil prices continue weakening, or the decline accelerates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
