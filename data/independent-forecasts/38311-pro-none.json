    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The summit is scheduled for June 2025, and today's date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The White House has officially confirmed President Trump's attendance, and it is standard protocol for a U.S. President to participate in the G7 summit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would most likely be caused by a last-minute political decision by President Trump to boycott the summit over a policy dispute, similar to his past contentious interactions at G7 meetings. Other, less likely, scenarios include a sudden health emergency or a major domestic/international crisis that requires his presence in the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'Yes' scenario is the current default path. President Trump follows through on the White House's confirmation, travels to Canada as planned, and physically participates in the G7 leaders' summit sessions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored heavily on the status quo and official information. The base rate for a U.S. President attending a G7 summit is very high. This is reinforced by the primary piece of evidence provided: a White House confirmation of his attendance, as reported by CTV. With the summit occurring this month, plans are in their final stages, making a cancellation less likely. The lack of any new information from my research assistant suggesting a change in plans further strengthens the 'Yes' case. \n\nHowever, the probability is not higher than 90% primarily due to President Trump's own history of unpredictability in foreign policy and his past behavior at G7 summits, particularly the 2018 meeting in Canada which he left early amidst disagreements. This personal factor introduces a non-trivial risk of a politically motivated, last-minute withdrawal. A sudden health issue or an unforeseen major global or domestic crisis represent smaller, secondary risks. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because, despite his unconventional style, President Trump has generally attended major international summits during his time in office. Cancelling at this late stage would be a significant diplomatic slight requiring a strong precipitating event, of which there is currently no sign. \n\nI would update my forecast higher if Trump made a positive public statement about the upcoming summit. I would update lower on any news of rising tensions with G7 host Canada, reports of a health issue, or the emergence of a significant crisis demanding his attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
