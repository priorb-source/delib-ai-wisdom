  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no successful coup has occurred in Africa or Latin America in 2025 thus far",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political stability continues in both regions through July 1, 2025. Governments in vulnerable countries (particularly in the Sahel region) successfully maintain control. Any coup attempts, like the foiled April 2025 Burkina Faso attempt, are detected and suppressed before achieving success. Regional organizations like ECOWAS and international pressure help deter would-be coup plotters.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political instability in one of Africa's vulnerable states (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, or another Sahel nation) escalates into a successful military takeover. Military officers dissatisfied with current leadership seize control of key government and military installations, with resistance quickly collapsing. Alternatively, a self-coup occurs in a Latin American country where an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election or dissolves democratic institutions.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for successful coups in Africa has been approximately 1-2 per year from 2020-2024, with 7 successful coups out of 9 notable coup events in Africa during this period. With roughly 2 months (17% of the year) remaining until the resolution date, a simple time-proportional calculation would suggest around 25-30% probability.\n\nSeveral factors support a moderate probability: (1) Recent coup attempts in Burkina Faso (foiled April 16, 2025) and Chad (January 2025) demonstrate ongoing instability; (2) The Sahel region remains particularly volatile with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso having formed a separate alliance after leaving ECOWAS; (3) The Cline Center data shows 14-16 coup-related events per year recently, suggesting continued elevated risk.\n\nHowever, factors tempering the probability include: (1) No successful coup has occurred yet in 2025 despite being 4 months into the year; (2) We've already passed through a period where a coup could have occurred but didn't; (3) Latin America adds minimal probability given zero successful coups in recent years despite attempts; (4) Regional and international pressure may be deterring some potential coup attempts.\n\nMy forecast would be higher (40-50%) if there were clearer signs of imminent political collapse in specific countries or if we had seen a successful coup already in 2025. It would be lower (15-20%) if there had been no coup attempts at all in 2025 or if regional stability mechanisms appeared stronger.\n\nTo update upward, I would need to see: escalating military tensions in a specific country, failed government responses to unrest, or credible intelligence of planned coups. To update downward: sustained political stabilization in vulnerable states, stronger regional responses to coup threats, or passage of more time without incidents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
