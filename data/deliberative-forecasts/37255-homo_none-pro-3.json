    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with each independently arriving at a forecast of 2%. The core reasoning is identical across all analyses, centering on Libya's profound and persistent political fragmentation, the resulting legislative paralysis, the extremely short two-month timeline until the deadline, and the fact that political actors' priorities are focused on domestic power struggles rather than international trade agreements. Forecaster 3 introduced a useful specific scenario for a 'Yes' outcome—a faction might ratify the treaty unilaterally to bolster its international legitimacy. While this is a plausible, low-probability pathway, it is already encompassed by the small residual probability we all assigned for unforeseen events. The arguments from the other forecasters are highly convincing as they mirror my own, and this strong consensus reinforces the confidence in a very low probability for ratification.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 2% remains unchanged. The analyses provided by the other two forecasters strongly corroborate my own reasoning. There were no new arguments or pieces of evidence presented that would justify an update. The shared conclusion, based on the same structural factors of political deadlock and the very short time remaining, strengthens my conviction in the original forecast. The status quo of non-ratification is exceptionally strong due to the deep-seated institutional dysfunction in Libya. The deliberation process has served to confirm, rather than challenge, my assessment that the probability of Libya ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is extremely low.",
