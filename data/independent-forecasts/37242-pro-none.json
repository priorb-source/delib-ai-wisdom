    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The data for April 2025 is expected to be published in the beginning of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo for tourism in the Canary Islands, as indicated by recent monthly data, is continued year-on-year growth, meaning April 2025 arrivals would be expected to be higher than April 2024.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Passenger arrivals in April 2025 are greater than or equal to April 2024. This scenario is strongly supported by the timing of the Easter holidays, which fell entirely within April 2025, whereas in 2024 the holiday peak was in late March. This calendar shift, combined with stable economic conditions in key European markets (UK, Germany), drives a significant increase in tourist traffic for the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Passenger arrivals fall in April 2025 compared to April 2024. This outcome would require a powerful negative shock to overwhelm the positive Easter holiday effect. Such a shock could include a sudden and severe economic downturn in key source markets, major disruptions to air travel, or a significantly larger-than-expected impact from recent local anti-tourism protests deterring last-minute bookings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on a powerful and predictable structural factor: the timing of the Easter holiday. In 2025, Easter Sunday was April 20th, placing the entire lucrative holiday travel period squarely within the month of April. In contrast, Easter 2024 was on March 31st, meaning the majority of that holiday traffic was recorded in March 2024, not April 2024. This calendar effect alone creates a very high likelihood that April 2025 figures will show substantial year-on-year growth. The general post-pandemic trend of increasing tourism, evidenced by the provided February 2025 vs. 2024 data, further supports this. The background information mentions potential negative consequences from US policies, but the US is a relatively small source market for the islands, and any indirect economic impacts on Europe would likely not materialize so suddenly and strongly as to reverse the massive Easter effect. My forecast for a 'Yes' outcome is not lower than 10% to account for the small but non-zero possibility of unforeseen events, such as a larger-than-expected deterrent effect from local anti-tourism protests or a sudden airline failure. My forecast is not higher because the Easter effect is such a dominant variable that it makes year-on-year growth the most probable outcome by a significant margin. I would lower my probability of a 'Yes' outcome if preliminary data from airlines showed record bookings. I would raise it if there were reports of mass cancellations or a sudden, severe economic shock in the UK or Germany during April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
