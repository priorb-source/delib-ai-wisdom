    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely aligns with mine at 75%, emphasizing the conference as a focal point and the Malta report. Forecaster 3 at 52% raises several important considerations I need to weigh more carefully: (1) **Status quo bias among remaining non-recognizers**: The 46 holdouts are predominantly US-aligned Western nations (US, Canada, Australia, Japan) or cautious EU states facing significant political costs for recognition. These are the 'hard cases.' (2) **Macron's conditionality**: Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that France tied recognition to 'certain conditions,' providing a clear off-ramp. I may have underweighted this hedge. (3) **Conference structure**: Valid point that the conference could produce communiqués without actual recognition announcements. (4) **Malta clarification**: I verified Malta does NOT currently recognize Palestine, so the Axios report, if accurate, would indeed be a new recognition. Forecaster 2's higher confidence may slightly overweight stated intentions versus actual delivery, while Forecaster 3 may underweight the event-driven catalyst effect of a purpose-built conference. The 2024 precedent of 5 coordinated recognitions demonstrates this CAN happen in waves, and the conference is explicitly designed to generate such momentum.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm moderately adjusting downward from 65% to 62%. Forecaster 3's emphasis on Macron's conditionality is particularly relevant - conditions provide a face-saving off-ramp if political calculations shift, and France's hesitation could dampen momentum for others. The structural obstacles facing the remaining 46 non-recognizers are real. However, I'm not dropping to 52% because: (1) the conference creates an unusual focal point with explicit recognition-generation goals, (2) multiple concrete signals point to June action (Malta report, Macron statements, UK alignment), (3) only ONE country needs to move for a Yes resolution - a low bar, (4) 2024's 5 recognitions prove coordinated waves can happen. The convergence of timing, purpose-built event, and multiple signals still creates meaningful probability above baseline. Key risks: France delays citing unmet conditions, US diplomatic pressure intensifies, or the conference becomes ceremonial without deliverables. Key upside: Even one small EU state (Malta, potentially Luxembourg or Belgium) taking the plunge would resolve Yes.",
