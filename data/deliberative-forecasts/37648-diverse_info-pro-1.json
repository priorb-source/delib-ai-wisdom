    "review": "The deliberation introduced two strong but opposing new lines of reasoning. Forecaster 2's analysis was compelling in its focus on the significant political and procedural hurdles on the US side, such as stated maximalist positions and potential INARA review, which I had not sufficiently weighed. This forecaster also correctly pointed out that informal, unannounced agreements are a more common outcome for de-escalation, and that would resolve as 'No'. This perspective significantly tempered my initial optimism. In contrast, Forecaster 3 presented crucial new evidence that I was not aware of: that four rounds of 'constructive' negotiations have already been completed, with a fifth scheduled. This directly counters Forecaster 2's argument about a lack of diplomatic signals and provides concrete evidence for the positive momentum I had initially sensed.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 40% to 30%. My initial forecast was driven by strong signals of Iranian intent and an Israeli intelligence assessment. Forecaster 2's points about US domestic political constraints and publicly stated 'red lines' provide a powerful reality check, highlighting that a deal requires major concessions from Washington that would be difficult to sell on a short timeline. This alone would have caused me to significantly lower my forecast. However, Forecaster 3's new information about four completed, productive negotiation rounds confirms that a serious, active process is underway, preventing me from dropping my forecast to a very low level. I am now weighing the concrete evidence of diplomatic progress against the high political barriers to a formal, public deal. While talks are clearly happening, the hurdles to finalizing and announcing a complex agreement that satisfies domestic political constraints in both countries before the July 1 deadline are immense. The combination of these new inputs makes me believe that a continuation of talks or an informal understanding (both resolving as 'No') is more likely than a formal announcement. The new information has therefore introduced more nuance and a better understanding of the barriers, leading me to a more conservative, slightly lower forecast.",
