  "information": "Recent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 13 months, as the resolution condition specifies the action must occur before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk are focused on this specific immigration topic on X, making a post containing the exact phrase 'diversity visa' unlikely without a new catalyst.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump continues to use Truth Social as his exclusive platform for political commentary. Elon Musk's posts remain focused on his business ventures, AI, and broader themes like free speech, rather than specific US immigration programs. The Diversity Visa program does not enter the mainstream news cycle in a way that would provoke a comment from either individual.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant news event, such as a national security incident or a major legislative push related to the program, causes 'diversity visa' to trend online. This prompts a reactive post from Elon Musk, who is highly active on X. Alternatively, as part of his 2024 campaign or a new administration's policy rollout, Donald Trump's team posts a formal statement on X that explicitly mentions the 'diversity visa' program.",
    "rationale": "The 28% probability balances the low base rate against the long time-frame which includes a volatile election period. The research assistant's report correctly points to strong reasons for a 'No' outcome: Trump's primary use of Truth Social and Musk's waning focus on US politics. This establishes the status quo. However, the resolution period extends to July 1, 2025, covering the entire US election cycle and its aftermath, a period when immigration will be a central issue. This significantly increases the chances of a triggering event. The probability is not higher due to two strong constraints: the requirement for the exact phrase 'diversity visa' (rather than a more common term like 'visa lottery') and Trump's near-abandonment of X as a personal platform. The probability is not lower because the combination of two highly unpredictable public figures, a hot-button political topic, and a 13-month timeframe creates several plausible pathways to a 'Yes' outcome, primarily through a reactive post by Musk or a formal policy announcement cross-posted by Trump's team. My forecast would increase if Trump's campaign begins using X more actively for policy statements. It would decrease if the 2024 election concludes without this specific program becoming a major talking point.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
