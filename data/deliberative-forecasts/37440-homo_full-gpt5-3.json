    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the structural hurdle: with the regular session closed, passage now requires either expanding the budget-focused extension or calling a special session—both uncommon without clear leadership signals. They also stress that the regular-session failure likely reflects intra-caucus hesitation or legal/administrative risk (NVRA issues), which won’t dissipate in May–June. They correctly note the bar for “Yes” is broad (HB 831-style provisions would count), but that still needs deliberate procedural action in a tight window. I find this persuasive and a useful tempering of my earlier weight on GOP alignment and Florida’s ability to move quickly. I didn’t explicitly foreground how unusual it is to broaden the scope of an extension; that’s a meaningful downside factor.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~8 weeks. The regular session ended without enactment, and CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn late—suggesting either prioritization elsewhere or caucus/legal concerns. The budget extension starting May 12 is conventionally confined to appropriations and implementing/conforming bills; adding election policy would require leadership to expand scope or a separate special session (technically possible, especially with supermajorities and the 2/3 mechanism to take up out-of-call items, but not typical). GOP control and the Governor’s track record keep a nontrivial chance alive, and the resolution’s broad criteria create multiple viable policy paths (e.g., ID marking, first-time registrant documentation). Still, the combination of procedural hurdles, short runway, and litigation/administrative risk argues for a lower base than my initial 25%. I’m trimming to reflect the lack of concrete signals and the regular-session miss. Upward movers: a special session call including elections/immigration, leadership statements prioritizing proof-of-citizenship, or filed/agendaed language reviving HB 831/HB 1381/SB 1330. Downward movers: explicit budget-only scope, adjournment without any election policy, or leadership deferring to a future session.",
