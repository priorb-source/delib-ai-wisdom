    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data within 2-3 weeks after month end. Since today is June 2, 2025 and May 2025 just ended, the official data should be available by mid-June 2025, so approximately 1-2 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 is likely not the hottest May on record. While global temperatures continue their long-term warming trend, May 2024 likely set an extremely high benchmark during the recent El Niño period, and not every month breaks records even as the climate warms.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 is not the hottest May on record because El Niño conditions that contributed to exceptional warmth in 2023-2024 had weakened or transitioned to neutral/La Niña conditions by May 2025. May 2024 set such a high bar during peak El Niño that May 2025, while still very warm, fell short of breaking the record. Natural variability also contributed to slightly cooler conditions in key regions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 is the hottest May on record because the long-term warming trend from greenhouse gas accumulation continued unabated, residual warmth from the recent El Niño persisted, and favorable natural variability patterns led to exceptionally warm conditions globally. The warming momentum from the record-breaking 2023-2024 period carried through into May 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast weighs several key factors. First, the base rate consideration: 2023 and 2024 were exceptionally warm years, with many months breaking records. However, May 2024 specifically likely set a very high benchmark during the peak of El Niño conditions, making it a difficult record to surpass. Second, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions have been transitioning from El Niño toward neutral or potentially La Niña by May 2025, which typically reduces global temperatures compared to El Niño peaks. Third, while the long-term warming trend is undeniable, not every month breaks records—there is natural variability superimposed on the trend. The research assistant provided no additional information to update my priors. My forecast is not higher because the very high bar set by May 2024 during El Niño and the typical ENSO transition timing make it more likely that May 2025, while warm, doesn't quite reach the top spot. My forecast is not lower because the underlying warming trend remains strong, 2025 follows immediately after two exceptionally warm years, and there's still meaningful probability that favorable conditions could produce a record. I would update higher if preliminary reports from meteorological agencies indicated May 2025 was exceptionally warm globally, or if El Niño conditions persisted longer than typical. I would update lower if early signals suggested May 2025 was notably cooler than May 2024, or if La Niña developed earlier and more strongly than expected.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
