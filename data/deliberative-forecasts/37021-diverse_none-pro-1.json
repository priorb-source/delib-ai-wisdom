    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful, particularly Forecaster 3's. My initial analysis was similar to Forecaster 2's, focusing on the general balance of high wartime inflationary risks against the stabilizing forces of central bank policy and international aid. However, Forecaster 3 provided a crucial and compelling argument that I had overlooked: the mechanics of the year-over-year (YoY) inflation calculation and the significance of the timing. Their point that moving from a recent trend well below 15% to at least 15% in a single month would require an extraordinarily large month-over-month price shock *in April* is a powerful argument for a 'No' resolution. Given that we are already at the end of April, such a massive shock would likely be public knowledge by now.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on Forecaster 3's reasoning. My initial forecast of 35% was too focused on the general medium-term risks of a wartime economy and did not adequately consider the statistical realities of the April-specific data point. To reach a 15% YoY rate for April 2025, given that recent inflation has been in the single digits, would necessitate a very large month-on-month price increase during April. As Forecaster 3 correctly points out, shocks like currency devaluation or infrastructure damage typically have effects that are distributed over several months, rather than causing a massive step-change in a single month's reading. The inertia in the YoY statistic is a powerful anchor. The absence of news about a catastrophic economic shock occurring within April makes such a large jump highly improbable. Therefore, I am lowering my probability from 35% to 12%. I am not going as low as Forecaster 3's 9% because I believe the wartime context still warrants a slightly fatter tail for unpredictable, rapid-onset events like a sudden fuel supply crisis, but I now see this as a tail risk rather than a central scenario.",
