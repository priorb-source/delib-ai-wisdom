  "information": "As of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Although all signs point to an announcement, Stevens' campaign team decides to delay the official launch until the first week of May to coincide with a planned campaign tour or to avoid a busy news cycle in late April. Alternatively, an unforeseen personal or political event could cause a last-minute postponement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Acting on months of preparation, and with the field of Democratic contenders narrowing, Haley Stevens' campaign schedules and conducts a formal announcement of her candidacy for the US Senate in the last week of April to capitalize on her strong fundraising and consolidate support.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is that Haley Stevens has not yet announced. However, the evidence strongly suggests an announcement is imminent and highly likely to occur before the May 1, 2025 deadline. The research indicates she has a substantial campaign fund ($1.6M), demonstrated strong recent fundraising ($1.2M in Q1), and has taken concrete operational steps like expanding her campaign staff. The most compelling piece of evidence is that she is actively seeking a replacement for her current House seat, which is a definitive step a candidate takes only when they are firmly committed to running for a different office. Furthermore, the political context is favorable, as other high-profile Democrats have declined to run, creating a clear opportunity for her to establish herself as a front-runner.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because there is always a small chance of an unforeseen event causing a delay, such as a family emergency, a sudden health issue, or a strategic decision to wait a few extra days for a more favorable media environment, which would push the announcement past the May 1 deadline. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the combination of robust fundraising, staff expansion, and active succession planning for her current seat constitutes overwhelming evidence of a planned campaign launch. These are not the actions of someone who is merely considering a run; they are the actions of someone finalizing their launch. I would raise my probability if a specific announcement date before May 1 is leaked by a credible source. I would lower it significantly if a major, unexpected candidate entered the race or if credible reports emerged of a serious impediment to her campaign.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
