    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short remaining time and very low base rates, which align with my priors. Forecaster 3 adds a useful explicit scaling: ~4%/year implies ~0.5% for 46 days for natural spillover, with lab risk adding only a tiny increment. That math supports a sub-1% baseline for spillover alone. Forecaster 2’s reminder of the required end-to-end chain (spillover → symptomatic care → sampling → sequencing → attribution → credible reporting before deadline) reinforces that even if a spillover occurs, timely resolution is nontrivial. The main point where I diverge slightly is Forecaster 3’s 3% headline, which seems a bit high relative to their own back-of-the-envelope (≈0.5% zoonotic + very small lab risk + detection/reporting frictions). I find Forecaster 2’s 2% more consistent with the evidence and timeframe. Neither raises new empirical signals that would push me higher.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: ~45 days is a very short window; no signals to date in WHO/CDC/ProMED/GISAID; and multiple SARI/metagenomic programs are running. HKU5‑CoV‑2 shows human-cell infectivity in vitro but with lower entry efficiency than SARS‑CoV‑2, implying biological plausibility without suggesting high immediate transmissibility. The base rate that any newly described bat CoV yields a confirmed human case within a year is ~4%; scaling to 1.5 months and conditioning on no prior detections suggests <1% for natural spillover alone in this window. Lab-associated infection risk specific to this virus over ~45 days remains extremely small, and even then requires rapid recognition and public reporting that meets the resolution criteria. Reporting and naming frictions (must be linked to HKU5‑CoV‑2 by a credible source before the deadline) further temper the probability. Given all this, I see no reason to raise my estimate; if anything, Forecaster 3’s explicit scaling slightly validates being at the low end. I will hold at 2%, with modest daily decay absent new signals.",
