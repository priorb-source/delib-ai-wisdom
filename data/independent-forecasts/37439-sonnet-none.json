    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days - the question window opens on May 12, 2025 (6 days from now) and closes on June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - absent specific information about a scheduled call, the default assumption is that a phone conversation will not occur in this particular 34-day window",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Putin do not speak by phone between May 12-June 15, 2025. This could occur if no pressing diplomatic issues arise requiring direct communication, if they communicate through alternative channels (in-person meetings, intermediaries, written communications), if either leader is unavailable or faces domestic political pressure to limit contact, or if their previous February call satisfied near-term communication needs",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Putin have a phone conversation in the specified window. This could happen due to urgent geopolitical developments (Ukraine war escalation/de-escalation, international crisis), scheduled follow-up to their February 2025 call, ongoing diplomatic negotiations requiring direct leader-level coordination, or either leader seeing strategic value in demonstrating continued dialogue",
    "rationale": "The February 2025 Putin-Trump call establishes that direct communication between these leaders is occurring in Trump's current term. This is a positive indicator that another call could happen. However, the question asks about a specific 34-day window, which is relatively narrow. For a call to occur, there needs to be sufficient reason, availability from both parties, and mutual acknowledgment. Factors supporting a higher probability: (1) established pattern of communication in 2025, (2) Trump's historical preference for direct leader engagement, (3) ongoing geopolitical issues (Ukraine, broader US-Russia relations) that might warrant dialogue, (4) 34 days provides reasonable opportunity for at least one triggering event. Factors supporting a lower probability: (1) no specific evidence of a planned call in this timeframe, (2) the narrow window makes any particular event less likely than a broader timeframe, (3) potential domestic political sensitivities around Trump-Putin communications, (4) they may use alternative communication methods. The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the Wikipedia reference to their February call. Applying status quo bias - without specific evidence of plans or compelling reasons for a call in this exact window, the baseline should be conservative. I would update higher if reports emerged of planned negotiations, diplomatic crises requiring direct communication, or either leader signaling intent to speak. I would update lower if tensions escalated significantly, Trump faced strong domestic pressure to limit Putin contact, or if extended periods passed without communication attempts",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
