    "review": "The deliberation introduced two crucial and conflicting new pieces of information. Forecaster 3's point that Vietnamese troops completed K9 training in November 2024 is a very strong positive indicator that a deal is substantively close to complete. However, Forecaster 2's evidence that the manufacturer, Hanwha, expects more export orders in the second half of 2025 is a powerful and more direct signal regarding the specific timeline of this question. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning most convincing because it directly addresses the short, two-month window until resolution. While the training indicates the deal's eventual likelihood is high, the manufacturer's guidance is the best available evidence for the *timing* of the announcement, and it points to a date after the deadline. Forecaster 2's focus on the status quo (no announcement in two months) being the default outcome is the most prudent stance.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly decreasing my forecast from 65% to 25%. My initial forecast was based on January 2025 reports of a deal being in its 'final stages' and expected in Q1 2025. The passing of that quarter without an announcement was already a negative signal. The new evidence provided by Forecaster 2—that the manufacturer Hanwha is guiding for more export orders in H2 2025—provides a strong explanation for this delay and suggests it will extend beyond the July 1 deadline. This piece of information directly contradicts the likelihood of a near-term announcement. While I find Forecaster 3's point about completed troop training to be excellent evidence that the deal is very real and advanced, this pertains to the deal's substance rather than its announcement timing. Given the short timeframe remaining, specific evidence on timing is more impactful. The path to a 'No' resolution simply requires the current status quo to continue for two more months, a scenario made more likely by the manufacturer's own timeline expectations. Thus, I have substantially lowered my probability to reflect this timeline-specific negative evidence.",
