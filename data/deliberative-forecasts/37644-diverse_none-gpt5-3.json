    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extremely short window (≈46 days) and the concrete resolution bar (public S-1 or an explicit Anthropic News post), noting the lack of any public signals, strong access to private capital, and the logistical rarity of pre-announcing an IPO without a filing. Forecaster 3 adds a useful comparison to OpenAI’s remaining private and highlights that “announcement only” slightly lifts odds but still requires board-level decisions that usually leave traces. I also find the implicit point that a late-June filing would run into the July 4th holiday period, which IPO candidates typically avoid, further constraining the realistic filing window.",
    "rationale": "I initially set 10% to allow for an AI-driven market window and the possibility of a surprise filing or an explicit company post. After weighing the others’ arguments and base rates, I think I overweighted the chance of an atypical News-page announcement. Companies rarely declare IPO intent absent a public S-1 due to gun-jumping concerns and flexibility loss. The remaining calendar is tight, and a credible filing in late June is less likely given holiday timing. Anthropic’s ample private funding options reduce urgency. With no public indications of bank mandates or filings, the prior should be low single digits. I’m adjusting down substantially from 10% to 3%. I would move higher on credible reports of underwriter selection or a leaked confidential submission followed by a public S-1; I would move lower on news of another large private round or explicit statements deferring an IPO.",
