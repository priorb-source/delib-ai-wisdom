    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I initially underweighted. They correctly note that the research assistant's 'no additional information available' indicates no current crisis signals as of May 22, 2025, which I misinterpreted. I had anchored heavily on the Wikipedia article reference suggesting an ongoing conflict, but they treat this appropriately as background context rather than evidence of current tensions. Their emphasis on three key constraints is persuasive: (1) nuclear deterrence remains extremely powerful, (2) the 31-day window is very short for crisis escalation, and (3) historical base rates show such strikes are extraordinarily rare even during major crises. Forecaster 3's distinction about the 2021 ceasefire understanding and general de-escalation trend is particularly valuable context I hadn't weighted sufficiently. Both forecasters correctly frame this as requiring a 'trigger event' (likely major terrorist attack) plus rapid response, all compressed into June 2025, which is inherently low probability.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overestimated the probability by misinterpreting the Wikipedia reference as indicating an active crisis rather than merely background context. The other forecasters' base rate reasoning is sound: Balakot in 2019 remains the only clear precedent of India striking Pakistan proper in recent decades, and it required exceptional circumstances (Pulwama attack killing 40+ CRPF personnel). My 18% implied roughly 1-in-6 odds of such a strike occurring in a random 31-day period, which is far too high absent any current indicators. The research assistant explicitly states no additional information is available, meaning no intelligence suggesting preparations, heightened tensions, or imminent provocations. However, I don't go quite as low as 5% because: (1) The question itself being asked suggests some non-negligible plausibility, (2) Terrorist attacks can occur with little warning, (3) India has demonstrated post-2019 willingness to conduct limited strikes under certain conditions, and (4) Technological advances (drones, standoff weapons) may lower operational barriers. I'm updating substantially downward to 7%, acknowledging the strong base rate arguments while maintaining slightly higher uncertainty than the other forecasters about tail-risk scenarios.",
