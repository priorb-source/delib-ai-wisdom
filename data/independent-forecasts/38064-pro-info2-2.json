  "information": "As of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The meeting will occur on a different date in early June, such as June 2 as indicated by the company's transfer agent, and not on June 12.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop files its official proxy statement (DEF 14A) with the SEC confirming the annual meeting for June 2, 2025, the date listed by its transfer agent, Computershare. The meeting is successfully held and completed on that earlier date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop files its definitive proxy statement in the next few days, officially setting the meeting date for Thursday, June 12, 2025. The meeting proceeds as planned and is fully completed on that day without postponement.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflicting information from available sources, but I place significantly more weight on the data from GameStop's official transfer agent. The core of my assessment rests on three points:\n\n1.  **Conflicting Sources:** There is a direct conflict between high-credibility sources. Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025. Transfer agents are directly involved in the logistics of shareholder meetings, making their information typically very reliable. Conversely, financial data providers like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12. The noted error in the Business Insider entry slightly diminishes the credibility of this data pool.\n\n2.  **Absence of Official Filing:** The most definitive source, the company's definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed with the SEC, has not yet been located. It is unusual for a company not to have filed this document so close to a purported meeting date, as shareholders must be given adequate notice. This absence of official confirmation increases uncertainty for any specific date.\n\n3.  **Weight of Evidence:** In the absence of a DEF 14A, I weigh the information from the transfer agent more heavily than that from financial media terminals. The transfer agent has a direct operational role, whereas data aggregators can sometimes display placeholder or unconfirmed data. Therefore, the June 2 date appears to be the more likely candidate at this time, making a 'No' outcome for June 12 the status quo.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because Bloomberg is a reputable source, and the June 12 date aligns with the historical mid-June timing of GameStop's meetings. It is possible the Computershare data is erroneous or outdated. My probability is not higher because the contradictory evidence from the official transfer agent is a very strong signal against the June 12 date. The lack of an SEC filing is the most significant factor preventing a higher confidence level.\n\nI would significantly increase my forecast towards 'Yes' upon the filing of a DEF 14A that confirms the June 12 date. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast to near zero if the filing confirms June 2 or any other date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
