  "information": "The Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas does not enact a full THC ban",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislative session ends without passing a comprehensive THC ban. The House continues to prioritize medical cannabis expansion over prohibition, and either no THC legislation passes, or only regulatory measures (not full bans) are enacted. The significant hemp industry lobbying and political opposition successfully blocks any full ban attempt.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite House resistance, the Texas Legislature passes a comprehensive ban on THC sales through a compromise or political shift in the final weeks of the session. The bill reconciles differences between the House's preference for regulation and the Senate's ban proposals, resulting in a full prohibition that the Governor signs before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly points toward a No outcome. The Texas House demonstrated overwhelming opposition to a full ban by voting 118-16 to expand medical cannabis access through HB 46. Most significantly, when faced with Senate Bill 3 that proposed a ban, the House committee adopted a substitute version that explicitly does NOT ban THC, instead creating a regulatory framework for certain low-THC products while prohibiting only vapes and synthetics. This shows the House is actively working against full prohibition. The $8 billion hemp industry represents substantial economic interests opposing a ban, with Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller also expressing concerns about business closures. The legislative dynamic shows clear divergence: the Senate favors prohibition while the House favors expansion and regulation. With only 48 days remaining, reconciling these vastly different positions into a full ban seems highly unlikely given the legislative process timeline. The probability is not lower (say 1-2%) because legislative outcomes can be unpredictable, and we lack complete information about ongoing negotiations or potential political developments. The probability is not higher because the evidence of House resistance is concrete and recent, the economic opposition is substantial, and the structural legislative barriers are significant. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: a dramatic shift in House leadership positions, a successful compromise bill emerging with ban language, or the Governor making this a priority issue. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation the legislative session has effectively ended without ban prospects.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
