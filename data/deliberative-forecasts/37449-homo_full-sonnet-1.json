    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a low probability. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the legal significance of 'blockade' terminology is particularly important - calling something a blockade under international law is tantamount to declaring an act of war, which raises the bar significantly higher than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3's clear distinction between exercises that simulate blockades versus actual interdiction of maritime traffic is crucial. The question resolves YES only if the US accuses China of actually blockading seaports, not merely conducting exercises. Currently, China is doing the latter. This means we need two things to happen: (1) China must move from exercises to actual blockade operations preventing ships from accessing Taiwan ports, and (2) the US must then publicly use 'blockade' language despite the enormous legal implications. Both forecasters also emphasize the historical precedent more strongly - even during the 1995-1996 crisis, the US avoided this language. The convergence around 7-10% across all three analyses, combined with these stronger arguments about legal implications and the exercise vs. actual blockade distinction, suggests I should update slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my estimate downward slightly. The key insights that warrant this adjustment are: (1) The legal weight of 'blockade' terminology as essentially declaring an act of war makes the US even more reluctant to use it than I initially considered; (2) The distinction between exercises simulating blockades (current status) versus actual interdiction of maritime traffic (what's required for resolution) means we need a major escalation that hasn't occurred yet; (3) The historical precedent of avoiding this language even during significant crises is more compelling when considered alongside the legal implications. However, I'm not going as low as 7% because: (1) Geopolitical situations can escalate rapidly, particularly with only 8 weeks of exposure; (2) China's increasingly aggressive posture and explicit blockade rehearsals create non-trivial tail risk; (3) The 2025 NDS prioritization of Taiwan suggests heightened US focus that could lead to stronger rhetoric if provoked; (4) Miscalculation or inadvertent escalation remains possible. The balance of evidence supports a low but not negligible probability.",
