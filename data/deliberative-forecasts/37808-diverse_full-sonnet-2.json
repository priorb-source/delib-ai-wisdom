    "review": "All three forecasters arrived independently at 85%, which is striking and suggests we're converging on a well-calibrated estimate. The common reasoning emphasizes: statutory basis of the DV program, extremely short 6-week timeframe, improbability of legislative change, ongoing DV-2026 cycle creating operational inertia, and legal barriers to abrupt removal. Forecaster 3 raised an important consideration I had underweighted: the **URL-specific technical risk**. The resolution explicitly requires the page to be at 'this location' - not just that the content exists somewhere on State.gov. Website reorganizations, even routine ones, could accidentally fail this criterion through URL changes or redirect issues, independent of policy decisions. This is a meaningful risk category separate from political opposition. Forecaster 2's point about the operational necessity of maintaining pages during an active cycle (DV-2026 results accessible until Sept 2026) strengthens the status quo case. However, I note that all forecasts may slightly underweight how extraordinarily difficult it is to execute significant changes in just 6 weeks within federal bureaucracy, even with political will.",
    "rationale": "The convergence at 85% reflects appropriate weighting of competing factors. The status quo is extremely strong: statutory program, active processing cycle, 6-week timeframe, bureaucratic inertia, and legal protections. Against this, we have three risk categories: (1) Political/administrative risk of executive action to remove the page (~5-7% probability given short timeframe and legal barriers), (2) URL-specific technical risk of website reorganization breaking the exact location requirement (~3-4% probability for routine maintenance), and (3) Legislative risk (~1-2% for passage in 6 weeks). The technical risk identified by Forecaster 3 is real - government websites do reorganize, and the resolution criterion is URL-specific. However, major URL changes on high-traffic informational pages typically involve redirects and advance notice, making sudden failures unlikely in 6 weeks. The political risk exists but faces significant barriers: any attempt to remove the page would likely trigger immediate litigation (precedent: Venezuelan TPS injunction), and the ongoing DV-2026 cycle creates strong operational justification for maintaining instruction pages. I'm staying at 85% rather than moving higher because the URL technicality adds meaningful uncertainty beyond pure policy risk, and the administration's immigration stance creates a non-trivial tail risk of aggressive action.",
