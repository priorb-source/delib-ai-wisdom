  "information": "The case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (47 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The default outcome is that Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States, likely in detention, as his legal challenges proceed through the typically slow judicial and administrative systems.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mahmoud Khalil's legal team is successful in obtaining a stay of removal from a federal court. The legal proceedings, appeals, or administrative processes are drawn out, preventing the government from finalizing and carrying out his physical deportation before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense political pressure from the State Department and outside groups, the executive branch expedites Khalil's case. His legal challenges are swiftly dismissed by a court deferring to executive authority on immigration matters, and ICE acts quickly to physically remove him from the country.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant and specific political will being directed at this case, which I believe is sufficient to overcome the usual inertia of the US legal and immigration systems within the short timeframe. The baseline assumption for any deportation case with an active legal challenge is that it will take more than 1.5 months. However, the provided intelligence indicates this is not a standard case. The Trump administration has an established track record of acting swiftly on its immigration priorities, as evidenced by the revocation of over 1,000 student visas since January. More importantly, this specific case has drawn high-level attention. The public statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the coordinated effort by the organization Betar US create immense pressure on the relevant agencies (DHS, ICE, DOJ) to produce a result. This transforms the case from a routine administrative matter into a political priority, dramatically increasing the likelihood of an expedited process. My probability is not higher because the US judicial system can still act as a powerful brake. A single federal judge could issue a temporary restraining order or a stay of removal that would be difficult to overcome before July 1, and Khalil's legal challenge is already in progress. The outcome is highly dependent on how the judiciary weighs the executive's authority against Khalil's legal claims. My probability is not lower because ignoring the explicit, high-level political intent and the administration's demonstrated willingness to act would be a forecasting error. The convergence of a clear policy goal, high-level political statements, and external pressure campaigns creates a powerful impetus for a 'Yes' outcome. I would increase my forecast if a court rules against Khalil's challenge. I would decrease it significantly if a court grants him a stay of removal.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism.
