    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar core reasoning: Osborn is in exploratory phase, 20 days have passed without announcement, status quo favors no announcement, and 38 days provides sufficient but not urgent time. Forecaster 2 makes a valuable point that most exploratory efforts don't convert to announcements within 5-6 weeks. Forecaster 3 raises the strongest new argument I had underweighted: there's no compelling reason he must announce BY June 1 specifically rather than later in summer 2025. While I focused on whether announcing by June 1 was feasible, I didn't fully consider whether he'd have incentive to do so versus taking more time. The 2026 midterms being 18+ months away means announcements in July or August would be equally viable. This reduces the probability that he'd specifically announce before the somewhat arbitrary June 1 cutoff.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, I find Forecaster 3's point about lack of urgency particularly persuasive. June 1 isn't a natural deadline for a 2026 Senate race - announcing in July or August would be just as reasonable. My original analysis focused too much on whether he could announce by June 1 (yes, the timeframe is sufficient) rather than whether he would have specific reason to do so before that date versus taking additional weeks. The public nature of his exploration remains a positive signal suggesting serious consideration, and early announcement does offer fundraising advantages. However, the combination of (1) no announcement in 20 days since the exploration report, (2) no compelling June 1 urgency, (3) careful deliberation being normal for major political decisions, and (4) many explorations not converting quickly all suggest I should weight the status quo slightly more heavily. I'm updating downward modestly from 38% to 35%, giving somewhat more weight to the possibility he takes additional time beyond June 1 to make his decision.",
