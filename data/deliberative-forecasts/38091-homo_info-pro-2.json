    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached the same initial probability, but their analysis introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had missed: the May 22 statement by acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro anticipating new signatories in the 'coming weeks and months.' This is a significant positive indicator that moves the forecast from being based on trend extrapolation to being supported by a direct, forward-looking statement from a key official. Forecaster 3’s argument, anchoring on the lack of a specific public announcement, is a valid point of caution. However, I find it less convincing for two reasons. First, past signings have often been announced with little to no public lead time. Second, and more importantly, the NASA administrator's statement directly counters the idea that there are no signals of an impending signing. Therefore, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning, which incorporates this key evidence, to be the most robust.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 65% but with increased confidence due to the deliberation. The new evidence provided by Forecaster 2—the statement from NASA's acting Administrator Janet Petro—is the key factor. Her use of the phrase 'coming weeks' provides a strong, specific signal that at least one more signing is in the final stages of negotiation and is expected in the very near term, which squarely includes the June 2025 window. This reinforces my initial analysis, which was based on the strong recent momentum of one signatory per month in April and May. The combination of the established trend and a specific forward-looking statement from a primary actor makes a 'Yes' outcome highly probable. My forecast is not higher because, as Forecaster 2 also noted, the one-month window is narrow, and diplomatic or administrative delays could easily push a late-June signing into July. While Forecaster 3's point about the lack of a named candidate is noted, I believe it is outweighed by the evidence of momentum and the NASA statement.",
