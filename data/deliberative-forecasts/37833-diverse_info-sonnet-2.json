    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2 provides crucial quantitative data showing Musk's political posting dropped from 51% to 19%, and both emphasize Trump's strong preference for Truth Social over X. Most importantly, they highlight the exact phrase constraint more rigorously than I did - even if immigration is discussed, alternative terms like 'visa lottery' or 'DV lottery' are more common. Forecaster 3's point about current attention being on other visa programs (Gold Card, H-1B) rather than the Diversity Visa is well-taken. Their analysis of base rates for a specific technical two-word phrase appearing within 40 days is more grounded than my assessment. However, I find their forecasts (4-5%) potentially slightly too low given the volatility of both individuals and the fact that Trump has historically attacked this specific program.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overestimated the probability. Key factors I must weight more heavily: (1) The exact phrase requirement is extremely constraining - discussions about the topic using 'visa lottery' or other terms won't resolve this question; (2) Trump predominantly uses Truth Social, making X posts from him rare; (3) Musk's political engagement has measurably decreased (51% to 19% of posts); (4) There is no current evidence either is focused on the Diversity Visa specifically - attention appears directed at H-1B and other programs; (5) The 40-day window is quite short for a specific technical phrase to appear organically. While I maintain that both individuals are volatile and could react to a viral post, and Trump has criticized the DV lottery program historically, these factors don't justify an 18% forecast. The combination of low current topical salience, reduced Musk political posting, Trump's X inactivity, and the exact-phrase requirement argue for a substantially lower probability. I'm updating to 7%, slightly above the other forecasters because I weight Trump's historical opposition to this specific program and the possibility of a reactive tweet somewhat higher, but well below my original forecast.",
