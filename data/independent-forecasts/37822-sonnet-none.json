    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Beto O'Rourke has not yet announced his candidacy, and if nothing changes, the resolution date will pass without an announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues to assess his viability and support among Texans, potentially waiting to see how political conditions evolve or deciding that another gubernatorial or Senate run is not strategically sound given his losses in 2018 and 2022. The July 1 deadline passes without a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke determines he has sufficient grassroots support and funding potential, and makes a formal announcement launching his Senate campaign before July 1, 2025, positioning himself for the 2026 election cycle when Senator John Cornyn's seat is up. He capitalizes on early entry to build momentum and organization.",
    "rationale": "With only 40 days remaining until the resolution date, I must heavily weight the status quo outcome that no announcement has been made yet. Beto O'Rourke's conditional statement ('if Texans want him to run') indicates he's testing the waters rather than having made a firm decision. His recent electoral history - a narrow loss to Ted Cruz in 2018 and a gubernatorial loss to Greg Abbott in 2022 - suggests caution about launching another statewide campaign. However, several factors prevent me from assigning a very low probability: (1) 40 days is sufficient time for a candidate to finalize a decision and make an announcement, (2) early announcements for 2026 Senate races are plausible, giving 16+ months of campaign time, (3) he has explicitly expressed openness to running, and (4) he remains a nationally known figure with fundraising capacity. The research assistant provided no additional information about recent campaign infrastructure development, staff hiring, or fundraising activity that would signal an imminent announcement. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of actual campaign preparation (staff hires, venue bookings, donor outreach). For me to revise downward, I would need statements suggesting he's decided against running or focusing on other political activities. The lack of concrete preparation signals in the remaining window, combined with status quo bias, leads me to a modest probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beto O'Rourke announce his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFort Worth Star-Telegram: [Beto O’Rourke says ‘if’ Texans want him to run for U.S. Senate, ‘yes I will'](https://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/bud-kennedy)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Beto O'Rourke announces his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
