    "review": "The other forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that align closely with mine, all falling in the 81-85% range. Forecaster 2 emphasizes that corporate layoffs will continue filtering into the data over coming weeks, supporting sustained elevation. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I should have emphasized more: weekly claims can mean-revert quickly if the late-May spike was driven by temporary state-specific factors or seasonal adjustment quirks. Both forecasters appropriately identify the next two weekly releases (June 7 and June 14) as critical update triggers. However, I note that the research shows both increases and decreases across different states, suggesting breadth rather than isolated anomalies. The four-week moving average at 235k provides strong signal through the noise.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, I remain confident in my original assessment. We all converge on 81-85%, reflecting strong agreement on the core evidence: current claims at 247k (27k above threshold), sustained 4-week average at 235k (highest since late 2021), and multiple confirming indicators of labor market cooling. The key uncertainty is whether weekly volatility could produce a sharp reversal. Forecaster 3's point about potential mean reversion is valid, but achieving a 27k drop within three weeks would be historically significant and would contradict the breadth of supporting evidence (47% YoY increase in job cuts, ADP showing only 37k jobs added, Fed Beige Book weakness, major corporate layoffs). The state-level data showed mixed changes, not isolated anomalies. While seasonal adjustments can create noise, the multi-week elevation and rising 4-week average suggest a genuine trend rather than statistical artifact. My 82% appropriately balances the strong directional evidence against inherent weekly volatility. I would update based on the June 7 and June 14 releases, but given current information, 82% remains well-calibrated.",
