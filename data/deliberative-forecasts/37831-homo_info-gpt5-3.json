    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key point I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: the CNT’s overwhelming vote to repeal the legal framework for parties and the signal they’ll draft a new law. That multi‑step sequencing makes a near‑term reversal costlier and less likely than a simple walk‑back of one decree. Forecaster 3 brings in litigation details (cases in Bamako courts and an appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court), which is a plausible, if limited, upside path; but they rightly note weak judicial independence and tight timelines. Both emphasize the 6‑week window, AES alignment reducing ECOWAS leverage, and the rarity of rapid U‑turns by Sahel juntas—points consistent with my prior reasoning. Net effect: the CNT repeal argument nudges me slightly lower; court challenges keep a small tail risk alive.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly 40 days. The status quo trajectory is consolidation, not liberalization: suspension in 2024, now dissolution in 2025, coupled with CNT legal changes suggesting a planned reset of party law. External pressure (UN/AU) has reputational weight but limited coercive force in the short run, especially after Mali’s break with ECOWAS and alignment within AES; Russia-linked security ties further dampen Western leverage. Domestic opposition appears fragmented and manageable so far, and the judiciary is unlikely to move both quickly and independently enough to compel compliance before July 1. A Yes path exists—e.g., a face‑saving tactical climbdown such as reinstating parties pending a new law, possibly prompted by court action, significant protests/strikes, or material economic/aid conditionality—but that would require the government to clearly announce a reversal of the May 13 decree, which is a high bar within weeks. Downside indicators would be further repressive measures or AES backing of the dissolution. Given the added weight of the CNT repeal/drafting process, I trim my estimate slightly.",
