  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia does not invade any country other than Ukraine, and the US does not accuse Russia of doing so",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues its military operations exclusively in Ukraine, focusing its forces on that conflict. No invasion of Belarus, Baltic states, Poland, or other countries occurs. The 'West-2025' exercises in Belarus conclude without incident. The question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia launches a military invasion of another country (such as moving forces into Belarus without consent, or attacking a Baltic state or Poland during the West-2025 exercises). The US government promptly and publicly accuses Russia of invasion, using official statements from the State Department, White House, or other governmental channels. The question resolves as Yes.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. With only 2 months remaining, several factors make a Russian invasion of another country highly unlikely: (1) Russia's military forces remain heavily committed in Ukraine with no evidence of force redeployment, (2) multiple independent sources (RUSI, CSIS, Politico, BBC) report no significant new buildups for operations outside Ukraine, (3) invading a NATO country would trigger Article 5 and risk direct military confrontation with the alliance, representing an extraordinary escalation, (4) major military operations require substantial preparation time that would be difficult to conceal. While President Zelensky warns of 150,000 Russian troops in Belarus preparing to invade Lithuania or Poland, this claim lacks independent corroboration from Western intelligence or think tanks. Ukraine has strong incentives to emphasize threats to maintain support. The recent US policy shift (voting against UN resolutions demanding Russian withdrawal, pushing alternative peace proposals) suggests the US may be less inclined to amplify Russian threat narratives. Historically, the US has quickly accused Russia of invasions when they occur, so if an invasion happened, the accusation would likely follow. However, the base rate for new Russian invasions is low - Russia hasn't invaded a new country since 2022. For my forecast to increase significantly, I would need: independent verification of major Russian force buildups near non-Ukrainian borders, credible Western intelligence warnings, or dramatic escalatory rhetoric from Russian leadership. For it to decrease further, clear evidence of Russian force withdrawals from Belarus or commitments limiting the West-2025 exercises would be needed. Balancing these factors and heavily weighting the status quo, I assign a low but non-zero probability to account for tail risk.",
