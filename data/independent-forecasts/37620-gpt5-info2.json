  "information": "Multiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 19 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov remains formally in office through May 31, 2025, continuing limited public appearances or statements while Moscow defers any formal change until later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within May, credible outlets report that Kadyrov resigns and the Kremlin appoints an acting head; or he is dismissed by presidential decree; or he dies/becomes incapacitated and an acting head is named—any of which occur before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Status quo inertia is strong, especially with only ~19 days left. Although Kadyrov publicly said on May 6 he wants to step down (per The Moscow Times), he has floated leaving before and stayed. The Kremlin typically choreographs Chechen leadership changes carefully given security/stability concerns and Kadyrov’s role. Immediate family successors (notably his 17-year-old son Adam and 26-year-old daughter Aishat) are likely ineligible to be formal head due to age requirements, suggesting any transition would require an interim figure, which Moscow may prefer to time deliberately rather than abruptly.\n\nThat said, the short-term hazard is materially above a generic baseline because: (1) persistent, multi‑source reporting of serious health issues (e.g., pancreatic/kidney problems) increases the risk of sudden incapacity; (2) visible succession‑prep signals (rapid promotions for Adam; Aishat in senior government role) indicate planning for an eventual handover; and (3) Kadyrov’s own statement about wanting to step down could foreshadow a negotiated exit. A Kremlin-managed resignation with immediate appointment of an acting head can be executed quickly if needed.\n\nWhy not higher: Only ~19 days remain; previous episodes of health rumors and step‑down hints did not culminate in departure; Moscow may prefer continuity during ongoing federal reshuffles and wartime pressures. Why not lower: Multiple plausible triggers (health, resignation accepted, dismissal) exist, and the public step‑down signal plus succession moves elevate near‑term odds above a pure status‑quo base rate.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of acute hospitalization/ICU or nonattendance at key meetings; Kremlin personnel groundwork (e.g., leaks about an acting head); state media framing legacy pieces; sudden travel to Moscow/abroad for treatment. What would move me down: Fresh, credible footage of Kadyrov in routine meetings with Kremlin principals; explicit Kremlin denials paired with new appointments reaffirming his tenure; indications that any transition is slated for a later window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
