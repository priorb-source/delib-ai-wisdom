    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize YC’s publicity and recruiting incentives and the possibility of a curated joint moment (panel, closing photo, or handoff). They also stress Musk’s attendance volatility and the lack of an announced joint session. The main new angle I hadn’t fully weighted is the “engineered handoff/photo-op” pathway even without a formal joint panel. However, I find Forecaster 3’s conditional P(shared stage | both attend) at 25–40% too high absent explicit scheduling, given security/PR complexity, Musk’s preference for control, and ongoing adversarial context. Forecaster 2’s framing of logistics/security as a brake on spontaneous co-appearances aligns with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "I still see the base case as separate appearances unless a joint segment is explicitly programmed. My earlier decomposition had: P(Altman attends) ~95%, P(Musk attends in person) ~65–70%, and P(share stage | both attend) ~10–15% without explicit scheduling. Incorporating the deliberators’ point about a deliberate handoff/photo op nudges up the “no-explicit-panel” path slightly, but the lack of any agenda hint and Musk’s litigation/PR posture keep the conditional share-stage probability low. Net effect: a small upward adjustment from 10% to 12% to account for the non-zero chance YC engineers a symbolic moment despite no formal joint panel yet.",
