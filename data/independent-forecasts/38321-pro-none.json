    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The NATO summit is scheduled for June 24-26, 2025. Therefore, the outcome will be known by the end of June 2025, in approximately 3 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The sitting US President, as the leader of the alliance's most powerful member, attends the annual NATO summit. This would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump declines to attend, sending the Vice President or Secretary of State in his place as a deliberate signal of his displeasure with the alliance's members over defense spending. Alternatively, a significant domestic crisis requires his presence in the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump travels to The Hague and attends the summit in person, using the platform to publicly pressure allies on their commitments and to assert his 'America First' foreign policy agenda directly to other world leaders.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is predicated on the key assumption that Donald J. Trump is the sitting US President in June 2025; if he is not, this question resolves to No and the probability would be zero. Conditioned on him being president, I forecast a 75% probability of attendance. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is historical precedent, specifically Trump's own. During his first term, despite his harsh criticism of the alliance, he attended every major NATO summit. This demonstrates a pattern of using these forums as a stage to confront allies and advance his agenda, rather than boycotting them. Attending provides a global spotlight which he favors, and it offers him maximum leverage to personally pressure other leaders.\n\nThe probability is not higher due to Trump's profound and publicly stated skepticism of NATO's value. His campaign rhetoric signals a potential for a more radical approach in a second term. He could choose to skip the summit as a powerful symbolic break from the past, sending a lower-level delegation to signal his administration's diminished commitment to the alliance. A sudden domestic crisis or a manufactured diplomatic dispute could also serve as a pretext for non-attendance.\n\nThe probability is not lower because skipping the event would be a departure from his own established presidential playbook. It is more in character for him to attend and dominate the proceedings than to cede the stage to other world leaders.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon official confirmation of his travel plans. I would decrease it if credible reports emerge of him planning to send a substitute, or if he makes fresh public statements threatening to withdraw the US from NATO.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
