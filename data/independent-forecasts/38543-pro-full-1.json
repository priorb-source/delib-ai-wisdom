  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical and scheduling constraints prevent a visit from being organized on such short notice. Despite the stated intent to meet, Donald Trump's confirmed travel to the G7 and NATO summits leaves an insufficient window for a trip to China. The leaders defer their meeting to a later date, possibly after the July tariff deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise diplomatic move characteristic of his style, Donald Trump makes a brief, unannounced visit to China between his G7 and NATO summit trips. The visit is framed as a critical, last-minute effort to personally finalize and sign the trade agreement with Xi Jinping before new tariffs take effect.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant logistical and scheduling challenges of arranging a presidential visit to China within a 15-day timeframe. Such visits typically require weeks, if not months, of advance preparation for security and protocol, and there are currently no public reports of any such arrangements being made. This aligns with the status quo, where high-level diplomatic intentions often take longer to materialize than initially suggested. Furthermore, Donald Trump's existing travel schedule, with summits in Canada (June 16-18) and the Netherlands (June 24-25), creates a very narrow and inconvenient window for a trip to Asia. The fact that the trade deal is still described as a 'framework agreement' subject to final approval also reduces the immediate impetus for a celebratory signing visit. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because of Trump's documented history of unconventional, last-minute diplomatic engagements and the significant pressure to finalize a trade deal before the July 8 tariff deadline. The recent public statements from both leaders confirming their intent to meet create some momentum. A rapid, no-frills visit focused solely on signing the agreement could theoretically be arranged faster than a full state visit, and the lack of public planning could be a deliberate strategy to create a dramatic diplomatic event.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the logistical barriers are substantial and represent the primary obstacle. The absence of any publicly visible preparations by advance teams is a very strong indicator that a visit is not imminent. \n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon any credible reports of US security or diplomatic advance teams arriving in China, or an official announcement from either government of a scheduled visit before July 1. I would decrease my forecast if an official statement confirms a meeting will occur at a later date, or simply as each day passes without any tangible signs of preparation.",
