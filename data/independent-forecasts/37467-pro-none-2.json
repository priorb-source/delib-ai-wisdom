    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company continues to operate by managing its costs and cash reserves without filing for bankruptcy protection.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat's cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to cover its operational expenses and obligations through the resolution date. Management continues its cost-cutting and turnaround efforts, avoiding an acute liquidity crisis during this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, severe liquidity event occurs, such as the unexpected calling of a loan, a major customer defaulting on a large payment, or the failure to secure crucial short-term financing, leaving the company unable to meet its obligations and forcing an immediate bankruptcy filing for protection.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the short timeframe of less than two months. While Beyond Meat is experiencing significant financial distress, as evidenced by its history of losses, corporate bankruptcy is a major event, not a default state. The status quo is for the company to continue operating. Based on its last reported financial statements, Beyond Meat had a cash buffer sufficient to cover its burn rate for several quarters, not just two months. A bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025, would require an acute, unforeseen event—a 'black swan'—rather than a simple continuation of current negative trends. The probability is not higher because the company's cash position provides a runway that extends well beyond the question's deadline. It is not lower than a few percentage points because the company is in a genuinely precarious situation, and the risk of a sudden negative shock, while small, is not zero. I would raise my forecast significantly on news of a major credit facility being pulled, a debt covenant violation, or an announcement from management that they are exploring strategic alternatives including bankruptcy. Conversely, I would lower my forecast upon news of a new capital infusion or a strategic partnership that shores up their balance sheet.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
