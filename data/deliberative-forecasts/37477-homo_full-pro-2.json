    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2 (75% Yes) presents a compelling structural argument, focusing on the resolution criteria: a 'Yes' outcome only requires a single day where both papers omit the word 'tariff(s)', whereas a 'No' requires an unbroken 23-day streak of the word appearing on at least one front page. They argue news cycle volatility makes a single-day gap likely. Forecaster 3 (11% Yes) argues from the opposite direction, contending that the news salience of the tariff story is so overwhelmingly high—due to the recent executive order and its cascading economic and political effects—that the probability of *both* major newspapers simultaneously dropping it from their front page on any given day is extremely low. They believe the momentum of the story makes a 23-day streak highly probable. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more convincing. While Forecaster 2's framing is useful, I believe they underestimate the daily probability of the story's appearance, making a simultaneous gap much rarer than their forecast implies. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the story's multifaceted nature (political, consumer, financial, international) correctly identifies why it is likely to remain on the front page of both a general and a business-focused newspaper.",
    "rationale": "After considering the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome from 20% to 15%. My initial reasoning was already aligned with Forecaster 3's, focusing on the high salience of the tariff story. However, their argument, combined with my own brief quantitative modeling, convinced me that I was likely too optimistic about the chances of a random gap in coverage. The key constraint is that *both* papers must omit the word on the *same day*. The tariff story, as described, is the dominant economic and political policy story of the moment, with new developments and impacts reported daily. It affects consumers, corporations, and government finance, giving it multiple angles that appeal to both the NYT's and WSJ's editors. The probability of the WSJ, a premier business paper, dropping the single biggest business story from its front page is minuscule. The probability of the NYT doing so is also very low. The joint probability of both happening on the same day is therefore extremely small. While a 23-day window offers several chances, the daily odds are so poor that the cumulative probability of a 'Yes' outcome remains low. I am decreasing my forecast by 5 percentage points to better reflect the high bar set by the resolution criteria when applied to such a dominant news story.",
