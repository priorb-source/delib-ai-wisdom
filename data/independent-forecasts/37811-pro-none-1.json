    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "41 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website Climate.gov, which is currently online, remains operational and accessible to the public, as a result of continued funding and maintenance by NOAA staff.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new administration, following through on actions similar to those described in the background article, issues a directive to take down the website. This directive is executed by NOAA before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, a major, unaddressed technical failure or cyberattack renders the site inaccessible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The website continues its normal operations. Despite any potential political pressure, bureaucratic inertia, the short time frame, and the existing operational budget prevent the site from being taken offline before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "The most significant factor in this forecast is the extremely short time until resolution, just 41 days. The website is currently operational, establishing a very strong status quo. The primary risk factor identified in the background material is political interference from a new administration potentially hostile to climate science. However, given that today is May 21, 2025, such an administration would have been in office for approximately four months. If taking down Climate.gov were a high-priority 'Day One' action, it is likely it would have already occurred. The fact that the site remains online suggests it is not an immediate target. Bureaucratic inertia is a powerful force within government agencies, and executing a directive to remove a major public resource would likely take time and could face internal resistance. Therefore, the probability of a politically motivated takedown being initiated and completed within the next 41 days is low. The secondary risk is a major technical failure, but for a high-availability government website run by an agency like NOAA, this risk is minimal. My forecast is not higher than 97% to account for the non-zero possibility of a sudden executive directive or an unexpected technical catastrophe. It is not lower because the short timeframe and the power of the status quo and bureaucratic inertia make the site's removal highly improbable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
