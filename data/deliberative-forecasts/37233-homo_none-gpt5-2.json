    "review": "Both forecasters correctly focus on the timing constraint and the lack of a known May party milestone. Forecaster 2’s framing (timing vs. whether he runs) and emphasis on the need for a May RHDP congress to lift odds is sound and aligns with base-rate practice in Ivorian politics. Forecaster 3 adds a sharper “short fuse” point and reputational/age considerations that reduce the incentive for an early announcement. Neither presents concrete evidence of a May investiture or similar event, which is the key catalyst for a pre–June 1 declaration. I didn’t see new hard information, but the stress on the short timeline and absence of a forcing event argues for shading my estimate slightly down.",
    "rationale": "There are ~33 days left and no publicly cited, fixed May RHDP congress/investiture. Historically, Ouattara has timed declarations later, and there is no legal filing deadline compelling a May announcement. While incentives to run may be real (incumbency advantage, opposition dynamics), they do not necessitate early timing. A Yes outcome before June 1 likely requires: (1) a May RHDP congress/political bureau explicitly to designate the candidate, with advance signaling he will accept; or (2) credible major-wire reporting of an imminent declaration. In the absence of such signals, the default is continued ambiguity into early summer. I’m nudging down from 30% to reflect the short fuse and lack of visible May triggers, while retaining non-trivial probability for a late-May party move or strategic preemption.",
