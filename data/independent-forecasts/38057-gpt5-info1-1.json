  "information": "This is a rematch for the UFC bantamweight title, scheduled to headline UFC 316 on June 7-8, 2025, in Newark, New Jersey. In their first fight at UFC 306 in September 2024, Merab Dvalishvili defeated Sean O'Malley by unanimous decision to win the championship. Commentator Joe Rogan has questioned how O'Malley gets past Dvalishvili's abilities, and former champion Henry Cejudo has referred to Dvalishvili as the greatest bantamweight of all time.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (UFC 316 is June 7–8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the bout goes ahead as scheduled and Dvalishvili, who won the first meeting, wins again.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late injury or replacement leads to either man facing someone else, or the fight is canceled; or the fight happens and O’Malley wins (KO/TKO/sub/decision) or the bout ends in a draw/No Contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "They fight at UFC 316 and Dvalishvili wins by decision via relentless wrestling/control, or by stoppage from ground-and-pound or a submission.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: They fought in Sept 2024 and Dvalishvili won a clear unanimous decision. Stylistically, his chain wrestling, pace, and cardio are persistent edges that typically carry over into rematches. Public commentary (Rogan skeptical of O’Malley’s paths; Cejudo praising Merab) aligns with that angle, though I weigh it lightly. With ~2 weeks left, most scheduled UFC main events proceed; I assign a single‑digit-to-low‑teens chance the matchup changes or is canceled. Conditional on the fight happening, I estimate Dvalishvili around the mid-to-high 60s to win again given the prior head-to-head, five-round cardio edge, and stable stylistic advantages. Unconditional probability is that win chance discounted by some chance of late fallout. Why not higher: O’Malley has elite striking and real finishing upside, judging trends increasingly favor damage over control, and rematch adjustments could improve his takedown defense and scramble decisions. MMA variance and the small but real risk of draw/NC or late opponent change also cap the probability. Why not lower: The most recent data point is a decisive Dvalishvili win built on replicable strengths; the time between fights is not so long that we should expect wholesale reversal of the style matchup. Update triggers upward: clean weigh-ins with Merab looking strong; reliable reports of O’Malley injury/compromised camp; market odds moving further toward Merab; referee/judge assignments known to reward wrestling control. Update triggers downward: credible injury/weight-cut issues for Merab; market movement toward O’Malley; reports of O’Malley’s markedly improved wrestling/TDD or specific game-planned counters; increased cancellation/replacement risk.",
