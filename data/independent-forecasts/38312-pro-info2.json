  "information": "Diplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 2025, and today's date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is defined by the significant diplomatic friction between the host nation, Canada, and India. While India is a regular G7 guest, the specific and severe nature of the bilateral dispute with the host makes non-attendance or a lack of invitation the current baseline if nothing changes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new Canadian government, despite expressing a desire to improve relations, decides that extending an invitation to PM Modi is politically untenable due to the ongoing investigation into the Nijjar killing. Alternatively, an invitation is extended, but India declines, citing Canada's lack of action against Khalistani elements as an unresolved issue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Recognizing India's crucial role as a global partner, the new Canadian government extends an invitation as a gesture to reset the bilateral relationship. PM Modi accepts, prioritizing multilateral engagement and using the summit as an opportunity for direct talks with Canadian PM Mark Carney to resolve outstanding issues.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'Yes' based on several key factors, despite the significant diplomatic strain between India and the host nation, Canada. Firstly, there is a strong precedent; India has become a regular and expected attendee at G7 outreach sessions, reflecting its growing geopolitical and economic importance. Excluding India would be a major diplomatic statement by the G7. Secondly, the research notes a change in leadership in Canada. A new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, provides a political opportunity to reset the relationship, and a G7 invitation is a standard tool for such a diplomatic maneuver. The mutual desire to strengthen ties, mentioned in the report, supports this. The G7's broader strategic interests, particularly in balancing China and engaging with the Global South, strongly favor India's inclusion. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the underlying cause of the diplomatic rift—the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and allegations of Indian involvement—is exceptionally serious. Domestic political pressure in Canada could make an invitation difficult for the new government. Furthermore, India may leverage the situation by declining an invitation if it feels its own demands regarding the activities of Khalistani separatists in Canada are not being met, making a 'No' outcome very plausible.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because the strategic imperatives for the G7 to engage with India likely outweigh the bilateral friction with the host. Other G7 members would probably pressure Canada to issue the invitation to maintain a cohesive front on global issues. For both India and Canada, the summit presents a valuable off-ramp to de-escalate tensions.\n\nI would increase my forecast if an official invitation is announced or if high-level talks between Indian and Canadian officials result in positive public statements. I would decrease my forecast if the Canadian government makes a public statement linking the invitation to the Nijjar investigation or if another week passes without any news of an invitation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
