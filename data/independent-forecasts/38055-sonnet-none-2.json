    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "UFC 316 is scheduled for sometime in 2025, likely within the next few months from May 26, 2025. The exact date would determine the precise timeline, but this is probably weeks to a few months away.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is that the rebooked fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum proceeds as scheduled at UFC 316, with the outcome uncertain but both fighters having realistic chances of victory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer doesn't fight at UFC 316 due to injury, weight cut issues, or other cancellation reasons (fairly common in MMA with 15-25% of fights cancelled). Alternatively, Pyfer fights but loses to his opponent via decision, knockout, or submission. A draw or no contest would also count as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rebooked fight against Kelvin Gastelum proceeds as scheduled, and Joe Pyfer wins via knockout, technical knockout, submission, or decision. Pyfer executes his game plan effectively and either finishes Gastelum or wins on the judges' scorecards.",
    "rationale": "According to the Sports Illustrated article, Joe Pyfer has a rebooked fight at UFC 316, likely against Kelvin Gastelum, after a Mexico cancellation. The key uncertainties are: (1) whether the fight actually happens, and (2) whether Pyfer wins if it does happen. In MMA, approximately 15-25% of scheduled fights get cancelled due to injuries, weight cut failures, or other issues - the fact this is already a rebooked fight after a cancellation slightly increases this risk. Assuming the fight happens (~75-80% probability), Pyfer's chances depend on the matchup dynamics. Without detailed information about Pyfer's recent record, ranking, or fighting style relative to Gastelum, I must assume a reasonably competitive matchup. Gastelum is a veteran middleweight with significant UFC experience, which could favor him, though the specifics of their current forms matter greatly. For a relatively even matchup between professional UFC fighters, win probability typically ranges 40-60% for either fighter. Given the combination of cancellation risk (~20-25%) and uncertain fight outcome if it happens (roughly 50-55% for Pyfer if slightly favored), my forecast is around 42%. This would be higher if: Pyfer is clearly the betting favorite, he's in excellent recent form, or Gastelum is coming off injuries. It would be lower if: there are reports of training camp issues, Pyfer is a significant underdog, or additional cancellation concerns emerge.",
