    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues to focus on developing and incrementally updating its Claude 3 model suite. They decide that their next major model, whether named Claude 4 or something else, requires further testing and refinement, or they are targeting a launch date in the second half of 2025. As a result, no model named 'Claude 4' is made available to the general public by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move to counter a competitor's recent release or to seize a market opportunity, Anthropic announces and launches Claude 4 in June 2025. The model is made immediately accessible without a waitlist via their public website and/or API, representing a significant leap in performance over the Claude 3 family.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely short timeframe and the complete absence of public information about an imminent release. With only 46 days until the deadline, the status quo—that Claude 4 is not available—is a very strong prior. Major flagship AI model releases are typically preceded by official announcements, technical papers, media briefings, or at least credible leaks, none of which have occurred for 'Claude 4' according to the available information. The resolution criteria are also strict, requiring the specific name 'Claude 4' and general availability without a waitlist, which is a high bar for a brand-new model launch.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the AI industry is characterized by rapid, unpredictable developments and intense competition. A surprise launch, while unlikely, cannot be ruled out. The roughly 15-month period since the Claude 3 family release (March 2024) is a plausible timeframe for a successor to be ready for deployment. Anthropic might opt for a compressed, surprise launch cycle to maximize impact.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the lack of any signal this close to the deadline is a powerful negative indicator. It would be highly unconventional for a company like Anthropic to launch a flagship product with no prior marketing or developer outreach. Furthermore, they might choose to release an intermediate model first (e.g., 'Claude 3.5') or use a different naming convention altogether, either of which would lead to a 'No' resolution.\n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon any credible announcement or leak from Anthropic regarding a Claude 4 release scheduled before July. I would decrease my forecast if Anthropic announces a different model for this timeframe or if the month of June begins with continued silence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
