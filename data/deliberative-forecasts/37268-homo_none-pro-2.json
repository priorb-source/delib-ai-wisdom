    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identify the central tension as being between Muqtada al-Sadr's very firm and public commitment to boycotting the political process and his well-established history of unpredictability and abrupt strategic shifts. The reasoning provided by both forecasters is highly convincing, as it mirrors my own initial analysis almost exactly, focusing on the strength of the status quo, the lack of any public signals of a reversal, and the strategic risk Sadr runs by allowing his rivals to consolidate power. The only difference is a minor one of probability, with Forecaster 3 at 20% and Forecaster 2 and I at 15%. This reflects a slightly different weighting of Sadr's 'wild card' nature against the powerful political inertia. Neither forecaster raised evidence or arguments I had not already considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I have decided to maintain my forecast of 15%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial reasoning rather than challenged it. The consensus among all three forecasters on the core factors strengthens my confidence in the analysis. The critical variable supporting a low probability is the very short timeframe—less than two months remain until the July 1 deadline. For a major political movement to reverse such a significant, publicly-stated boycott and effectively prepare for an election in such a short period would require an extraordinary political development. Currently, there are no signs of such a development. While I agree with the other forecasters that Sadr's unpredictability is the primary driver for any non-zero probability of a 'Yes' outcome, the firmness of his repeated statements and the rapidly closing window make a change unlikely. The 5-point difference between my forecast and Forecaster 3's reflects a small difference in judgment, and I remain more convinced that the immediate, concrete factors (the stated boycott, the lack of time) outweigh the general, historical factor of his unpredictability. Therefore, without new information, I see no reason to adjust my initial forecast.",
