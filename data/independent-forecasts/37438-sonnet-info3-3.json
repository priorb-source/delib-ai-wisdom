  "information": "In February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California. The company is also launching a new AC Level 2 charging technology with bidirectional capabilities, scheduled for release in Europe by summer 2025 and in North America by the end of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 57 days until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint continues normal operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint manages its cash position and operational costs effectively through June 2025, potentially securing additional funding or contracts. The company continues executing on its product roadmap, including the bidirectional AC Level 2 charging technology launch, and maintains sufficient liquidity to meet obligations without needing bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces an acute liquidity crisis within the next 8 weeks due to inability to meet debt obligations, severe cash shortfall, vendor payment defaults, or loss of critical financing. The company's board determines that bankruptcy protection is necessary to restructure operations or debts, leading to a Chapter 11 filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. ChargePoint recently reported Q4 and full FY2025 results and just secured over $19M in NEVI funding on May 1, 2025, only 4 days ago. The company is actively launching new technology products, indicating forward-looking business operations rather than distress. Companies contemplating bankruptcy typically show significant warning signs months in advance - distressed debt trading, going concern warnings, executive departures, or news reports about financial difficulties. None of these appear present based on available information. The extremely short timeframe (under 2 months) makes bankruptcy even less likely, as such filings usually require preparation and would typically be preceded by public signals of distress. The federal EV charging funding pause is a sector headwind, but ChargePoint's recent NEVI funding success suggests they're still competitive for available contracts. My forecast is not higher because uncertainty always exists, and I lack complete visibility into ChargePoint's detailed financial position, debt maturity schedule, and liquidity cushion. A sudden unexpected crisis, though unlikely, is theoretically possible. My forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because EV infrastructure companies have faced sector challenges, and without seeing the complete financial statements, some residual bankruptcy risk exists for any company. I would update significantly higher with: going concern warnings, debt default news, sudden executive departures, or reports of bankruptcy preparation. I would update lower with: additional major funding announcements, strong liquidity position disclosures, or debt refinancing news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
