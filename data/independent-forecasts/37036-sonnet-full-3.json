  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not yet made a formal candidacy announcement, having only formed an exploratory committee in early April 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn maintains his exploratory committee status through May and delays his formal candidacy announcement until after June 1, 2025. He sticks to his stated timeline of deciding 'by early summer,' interpreting this as mid-June or July. This would mirror his 2024 campaign pattern where he announced in July, and align with the typical 3-6 month duration of exploratory committees.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates his timeline and formally announces his candidacy in late April or May 2025. This could be triggered by wanting to capitalize on momentum from Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts (which directly attacked Osborn), pressure to match other 2026 candidates who announced in April, or fundraising imperatives that favor earlier entry into the race.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors 'No' given that Osborn only formed his exploratory committee 3 weeks ago and explicitly stated he would decide 'by early summer.' With only 38 days remaining until June 1, historical patterns suggest this timeline is compressed. In his 2024 Senate run, he announced in July 2023 (16 months before the election), and a similar pattern for 2026 would place his announcement in June or July 2025. Exploratory committees typically last 3-6 months before formal announcements. However, several factors create upward pressure on the probability: Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts that directly attacked Osborn may accelerate his timeline, other 2026 Senate candidates announced in April, and 'early summer' could technically include late May. The key uncertainty is how strictly Osborn will adhere to his 'early summer' timeline versus whether he interprets June 1 as falling within that window. June 1 marks the meteorological start of summer but precedes the astronomical summer solstice on June 21. My forecast is not higher because the preponderance of evidence suggests he's planning a June/July announcement, and 'early summer' more naturally refers to June than May. It's not lower because there's meaningful chance of acceleration given recent political developments and the precedent of other candidates announcing now. I would revise upward if Osborn makes statements suggesting imminent announcement plans or if reporting indicates accelerated campaign infrastructure development. I would revise downward if he reiterates a June/July timeline or if there are signs of continued deliberation.",
