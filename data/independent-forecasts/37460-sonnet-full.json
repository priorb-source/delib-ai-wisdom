  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if no new protests meeting the criteria occur or are reported by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government's crackdown successfully deters large-scale protests, or protests that do occur remain below 10,000 participants, or the Global Protest Tracker does not report qualifying protests in their database before the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing political tensions from İmamoğlu's arrest, upcoming trial hearings (particularly the May 30 hearing for Saraçhane protesters), or other catalysts spark additional large protests that exceed 10,000 participants, and the Global Protest Tracker documents at least one such event in their database",
    "rationale": "The current situation in Turkey shows sustained protest momentum with several factors supporting continued large demonstrations: (1) The Republican People's Party explicitly announced plans for continued protests after the March demonstrations; (2) Recent protests have shown capacity for large turnouts - the March 29 protest allegedly had over 2 million participants according to CHP, and even the May 1 authorized marches alone drew 65,000; (3) Upcoming catalysts exist, particularly the May 30 trial hearing which falls well within the timeframe; (4) Underlying grievances remain unresolved - 48.6% inflation, political repression, and İmamoğlu's detention continue. However, several factors create uncertainty: The government has demonstrated willingness to crack down aggressively (1,900+ detained, 52,000 police deployed on May 1), which may deter participation. More critically, there's uncertainty about whether the Global Protest Tracker will report qualifying protests - academic databases often lag real-time events, and the question hinges specifically on GPT's reporting, not just whether protests occur. The resolution criteria require a start date after question launch, so the March protests likely don't count. With 55 days remaining and clear catalysts ahead, I expect at least one protest over 10,000 to occur. The main downside risk is GPT reporting lag or selective coverage. I'm not higher (80%+) because of genuine uncertainty about GPT's reporting practices and government suppression effectiveness. I'm not lower (50%-) because the protest momentum is strong, catalysts are clear, and Turkey has demonstrated capacity for very large protests recently. I would update higher if: CHP announces specific large protest plans, crackdown eases, or we see evidence GPT is actively updating Turkey coverage. I would update lower if: protest momentum clearly dissipates, government successfully suppresses organization, or we learn GPT has significant reporting lag for 2025 events.",
