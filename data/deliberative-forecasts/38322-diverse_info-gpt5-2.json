    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes tariff salience and inflation expectations as key drivers, which aligns with the Michigan survey’s sensitivity to price news. However, the cited 7.3% one-year inflation expectation looks unusually high by historical Michigan standards and I can’t verify it; I treat that claim as uncertain. Their overall structure—status quo favors weakness, but a single positive macro surprise could flip the outcome—is sound, and their 65% is close to my prior. Forecaster 3’s assertion that <54 requires crisis-level conditions is not persuasive in this context. We are already at 52.2 for May (final), so the hurdle for a No outcome is an ordinary-sized rebound (~+1.8 points), not a repudiation of crisis-level sentiment. I do agree with Forecaster 3 that the time window is short and that preliminary June will be decisive, and I also credit the upside risk signaled by the Conference Board bounce. Overall, F2’s framing largely supports my prior; F3 underweights the current starting point and overstates how rare sub-54 is, but rightly flags upside catalysts.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: May final is 52.2, below the 54.0 threshold. Typical month-to-month swings in Michigan sentiment are often in the 2–4 point range, and final vs. preliminary revisions are usually small. To resolve No, June would need a modest rebound to ≥54; that’s plausible but not the base case without clear positive catalysts. Near-term catalysts: (1) May jobs (June 7) and May CPI (June 12); (2) gasoline prices and equity market moves; (3) tariff headlines. The Conference Board’s sizable rebound to 98 introduces upside risk, but Michigan is more inflation-sensitive, and the recent narrative around tariffs/prices has been a headwind. Given the current level (52.2), soft ISM prints, and the survey’s inflation salience, I still see <54 as somewhat more likely. I’m not moving meaningfully on F2/F3’s inputs: F2’s added claims on inflation expectations are questionable, and F3’s “extreme threshold” argument conflicts with the current print. I will lean slightly to the status quo holding below 54 unless a benign CPI and strong prelim reading materialize. No change to my prior: I already incorporated the upside risk from the Conference Board bounce and the possibility of mean reversion.",
