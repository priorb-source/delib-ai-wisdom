    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks take longer than two months, the firm or FSIS identifies additional consignees or lots (prompting updates/expansions), or product distribution breadth (e.g., frozen retail items across multiple states) slows verification, so FSIS does not mark the recall Closed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen completes all corrective actions and documentation, FSIS verifies effectiveness to the required level without complications, and the recall page status flips from Active to Closed sometime in May or June.",
    "rationale": "The recall was posted April 24, 2025 and involves misbranding/undeclared allergen for ~65,000 lbs of pork buns. For FSIS recalls, closures often occur once effectiveness checks are completed and documentation is verified; many straightforward allergen/misbranding recalls close within roughly 1–3 months, but timelines vary with distribution scope and complexity. With about 56 days left, closure before July 1 is plausible but not assured. The relatively large quantity and likely multi-state or broad distribution (common for frozen buns) can extend effectiveness checks, tilting toward the recall still being Active by the deadline. No evidence of illnesses or complex hazards suggests no special delay, but lack of additional information on distribution breadth and consignee count keeps uncertainty high. I weight the status quo (Active) outcome somewhat more heavily because FSIS processes often take longer than hoped and expansions or administrative pacing can push closure beyond two months. Not higher: the size and probable breadth of distribution, and the fact we’re only ~11 days from posting today, make a sub-50% chance reasonable. Not lower: many similar allergen misbranding recalls do close within 6–10 weeks when straightforward. Update signals upward: FSIS posts updates indicating effective recall completion or narrow distribution; no expansions by early June. Signals downward: recall expansion, additional affected products/states, or indications of complex retail/consumer-level retrieval that typically lengthen timelines. The research assistant found no extra information, so this forecast relies on general FSIS recall timing patterns and the limited details provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
