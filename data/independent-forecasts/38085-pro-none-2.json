    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent available data, from an April 28, 2025 article, indicates that 14 million Florida residents were under drought conditions. If this number does not change, it would meet the threshold for a 'Yes' resolution (>= 14.0 million).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's typical summer wet season in June brings consistent and widespread rainfall across the peninsula. These rains sufficiently alleviate drought conditions in populous areas, causing the Drought Monitor to report a total affected population below 14.0 million by June 28, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences a delayed or weaker-than-average start to its summer rainy season. Persistently dry and hot conditions through June cause the existing drought to hold steady or even expand, keeping the number of residents living in drought-affected areas at or above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflict between two primary factors: the current drought conditions and strong seasonal weather patterns. The status quo, as of late April 2025, is exactly at the 14.0 million threshold. This provides a strong anchor for a 'Yes' outcome, as conditions only need to persist, not worsen, for the question to resolve as Yes. However, the forecast period of May 29 to June 28 covers the typical onset of Florida's wet season. This is a powerful climatological force that strongly favors drought alleviation. The probability of daily, drenching thunderstorms increases substantially in June, which can rapidly improve surface and soil moisture conditions. The core of my forecast rests on whether this seasonal shift will be potent enough over the next 30 days to reduce the drought-affected population. I am placing the probability slightly below 50% because the seasonal trend is a more powerful driver of short-term change than the inertia of the existing drought. While drought recovery can be slow, a month of typical June rainfall in Florida is significant. My forecast is not lower because the starting point is exactly at the threshold, and a brief delay in the onset of the wet season could easily lead to a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher because betting against the arrival of Florida's summer rains in June is climatologically unlikely. I would increase my probability for 'Yes' if long-range forecasts for June indicated a persistent high-pressure ridge leading to below-average precipitation. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if a tropical system was forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the state.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
