  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no successful coup in Africa or Latin America by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Recent coup attempts in places like Burkina Faso and Chad remain foiled; Sahel juntas deter rivals and maintain internal cohesion; Chad’s early-May election passes without a military takeover; Latin America experiences legal/political turmoil but no seizure of power or qualifying self-coup.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military faction or security elites in a high-risk African state (e.g., Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mali, Guinea-Bissau) oust the sitting executive and consolidate control, or a self-coup occurs around an election (most plausibly in Africa, such as a contested post-election environment in Chad) with the perpetrator establishing authority over government and military and quelling significant resistance.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and recent trend: The Cline Center’s Coup d’État Project finds an uptick since 2021 (roughly mid-teens total coup events per year), with 5 successful coups in 2024. Africa accounts for most recent successes; Latin America has had notable attempts (Peru 2022 self-coup attempt, Brazil Jan 2023 unrest, Bolivia June 2024 attempt) but no recent successes. Your assistant notes that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa had multiple successful coups, while Latin America’s recent attempts failed.\n\nCurrent signals: 2025 YTD has seen at least two notable African attempts/plots but no successes (e.g., a possible attempt in Chad in January; a foiled plot in Burkina Faso in mid-April). That indicates elevated underlying hazard but also capable regime countermeasures. The window remaining is short (~2.2 months).\n\nTiming and hotspots: Risk concentrates in Sahel states already governed by juntas (where counter-coups are plausible) and in countries approaching contentious political moments. Chad’s presidential election in early May is a focal trigger; post-election disputes could create an opening. Burkina Faso has had repeated foiled plots, implying both ongoing conspiracy risk and strong regime vigilance. Niger and Mali face internal and external strains but are comparatively consolidated at the moment. Latin America’s near-term coup risk remains low: despite legal maneuvers and rhetoric (e.g., Venezuela accusations, Brazil investigations), there are no clear triggers before July 1 likely to produce a successful takeover that meets the question’s definition.\n\nBase-rate framing for the 67-day window: Since 2020, Africa has averaged on the order of roughly 1–2 successful coups per year (clustered in 2020–2023, with fewer in 2024). Translating that to a ~2.2-month window yields a ballpark 15–30% chance for at least one success, before incorporating current signals. The fresh foiled plot in Burkina and a sensitive election in Chad nudge risk up within that band; Latin America adds only a few percentage points at most.\n\nWhy not higher: The time window is short; many attempts fail; recent African juntas have shown strong internal security and purges that deter or disrupt plots. We’ve also gone nearly four months into 2025 without a successful coup, suggesting either lower annual hazard this year or better regime control.\n\nWhy not lower: The Sahel remains unusually coup-prone by global standards, with active plotting evidenced this year. Election-related stressors (especially in Chad) raise near-term risk. Multiple recent attempts indicate a non-trivial probability that one succeeds.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of elite splits, mass arrests of senior officers, or mutinies in Chad, Burkina, or Niger; contested post-election dynamics in Chad with military defection; coordinated security force movements in a capital; breakdowns in command within Sahel militaries; a sudden constitutional crisis in a Latin American country with security force alignment behind incumbents or plotters.\n\nWhat would move me down: Calm passage of Chad’s election and consolidation of authority; credible purges that neutralize known plot networks without backlash; improved regional security cooperation; absence of fresh coup-related signals across Sahel for several weeks; stabilizing economic or political indicators in key hotspots.\n\nSummary of assistant’s inputs affecting the forecast: Foiled Burkina Faso plot (Apr 16, 2025); possible Chad attempt (Jan 2025); documented uptick in coups/events since 2021 but still below 1960s–70s levels; 2024 saw multiple attempts globally with five successful coups; Latin America had recent attempts but none successful, and none reported in 2025 so far. These support a moderate—non-trivial but sub-50%—probability over the short window.",

If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
