    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - 'snack foods' is currently explicitly mentioned on the USDA's What Can SNAP Buy? webpage as of May 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USDA removes the specific phrase 'snack foods' from the webpage before July 1st, either due to policy changes restricting SNAP purchases following through on the Trump USDA chief's statements about banning 'bad food,' or due to a website reorganization/update that removes or rephrases this specific terminology",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The webpage remains unchanged with 'snack foods' explicitly listed, or any updates to the page retain this specific phrase. Given the short timeframe and bureaucratic processes required for major SNAP policy changes, the status quo is maintained through July 1st",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Several factors support this: (1) Bureaucratic inertia - government agencies move slowly, and major SNAP policy changes require formal rulemaking processes, public comment periods, legal review, and often Congressional action, which typically take months to years, not weeks. (2) Timeline constraints - only 6 weeks remain, and the February article suggests policy intentions rather than imminent changes. (3) Legal framework - SNAP is governed by federal law, and restricting eligible items would require either legislation or extensive regulatory procedures. (4) The narrow resolution criterion - the question only asks whether the specific phrase appears on the webpage, not whether underlying policy has changed. Even if policy discussions are ongoing, websites often aren't updated until changes are finalized. However, some downside risks exist: (1) Website reorganizations unrelated to policy could remove or rephrase this specific term, (2) There's a small possibility of expedited administrative action given political priorities, (3) Preemptive website updates could occur in anticipation of coming changes. I'm not forecasting higher because government websites do undergo updates, and there's always some uncertainty around technical changes or unexpected rapid action. I'm not forecasting lower because 6 weeks is an extremely short timeframe for implementing major SNAP policy changes that would affect webpage content, and the strong bureaucratic and legal processes create substantial barriers to rapid change. To update higher, I would need explicit USDA statements confirming no changes to the eligible foods list. To update lower, I would need announcements of imminent policy implementation, published proposed rules, or statements about pending website updates",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
