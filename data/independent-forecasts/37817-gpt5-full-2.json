  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom’s ROR page on/just after July 1, 2025 lists 3–5 non-stop destinations, e.g., Guam (United), Taipei (China Airlines), and likely Manila (United), possibly plus Yap if operating; no additional Korean, Hong Kong, Australian, or Japanese scheduled non-stops are shown beyond those.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, 2025, FlightsFrom lists at least six non-stop destinations from ROR, e.g., Guam, Taipei, Manila, plus some combination of Seoul (a resumed scheduled service), Hong Kong (scheduled, not charter), Yap (if operating), and Tokyo-Narita if United’s Oct 29, 2025 service is already loaded and displayed on the site as a listed destination.",
    "rationale": "The resolution source counts the destinations listed on FlightsFrom’s ROR page when checked on or after July 1. Charters typically don’t appear; future scheduled services sometimes do if filed in the current season’s schedules.\n\nStatus quo: Palau is a small market still recovering from the pandemic. The core scheduled non-stops likely include Guam (UA) and Taipei (CI). Manila non-stops from United have historically operated on a triangular pattern and may still be present, but I’m not fully certain. Yap may or may not be operating non-stop from ROR at this time. That baseline suggests roughly 3–4 destinations today, with 5 being a stretch and 6 requiring multiple additions.\n\nRA inputs I’m weighting: \n- United’s Narita–Koror start announced for Oct 29, 2025. That is after July 1; however, FlightsFrom may still list it by July 1 if it’s filed in the summer schedule, which could add one “listed” destination even if service hasn’t begun. \n- Qantas “Brisbane–Koror” launch in Feb 2025: I’m skeptical. It would be highly atypical for Qantas’s network strategy and hasn’t had widely reported corroboration; also any such service would need to appear as a scheduled route on FlightsFrom by July 1 to count. I discount this significantly. \n- JAL charter resumptions don’t count for this question if they’re not filed as scheduled services. \n- Korean routes (Air Seoul/T’way pre-pandemic) and Hong Kong Airlines: both are plausible medium-term resumptions, but neither is clearly operating as scheduled service now. \n\nWhy not higher: To get >5, we likely need at least two or three of the following to be listed simultaneously by July 1: a resumed scheduled Korean route, Hong Kong scheduled service, Yap listed as non-stop, and Narita listed ahead of its Oct 29 start. Given Palau’s slow tourism recovery, China’s tour ban due to Palau–Taiwan ties, and airline caution on thin leisure routes, that combination is unlikely within ~6 weeks.\n\nWhy not lower: There are plausible upside paths. FlightsFrom might list the future United Narita route by July 1. A subsidized or summer-seasonal Korean service could be filed. If both Manila and Yap are filed as non-stops at that time, the count could approach 5, and one more (e.g., Narita listed) could tip it to 6.\n\nWhat would move me up: Verified filing (in OAG/FlightsFrom) before July 1 of any two among: ICN–ROR scheduled service, HKG–ROR scheduled service, BNE–ROR scheduled service; plus confirmation that MNL and YAP are simultaneously listed as non-stops. Also, confirmation that FlightsFrom is already listing NRT–ROR for late Oct. \nWhat would move me down: Evidence that Manila is not currently scheduled non-stop, that Yap is not operating, or that China Airlines reduces/pauses Taipei; or confirmation that FlightsFrom does not list future-start routes like NRT until closer to the start date.",
