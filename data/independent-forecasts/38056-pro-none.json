    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 months, assuming a hypothetical event date of January 2026 for UFC 316, as the event is not yet officially scheduled.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight is not officially scheduled. Many fights are cancelled or changed, so the status quo is that this specific matchup does not occur as described, resolving the question as 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight is cancelled due to injury or other reasons, or it is scheduled for a different event. Alternatively, inside the octagon, Azamat Murzakanov overcomes the reach disadvantage, lands a powerful strike on Walker's questionable chin, and wins via knockout or TKO.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled at UFC 316. Johnny Walker effectively utilizes his significant 11-inch reach advantage with kicks and long punches to keep Murzakanov at a distance, ultimately securing a victory by knockout or a clear decision.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary factors: the probability of the fight occurring as specified and the likely outcome if it does. \n\nFirst, the resolution criteria state that if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, it resolves as 'No'. As this fight is not yet officially booked, there is a non-trivial chance it is cancelled or rescheduled due to injury, contract issues, or other changes, which favors a 'No' outcome. \n\nSecond, analyzing the matchup itself reveals a volatile clash of styles. Johnny Walker possesses extraordinary physical advantages with an 8-inch height and 11-inch reach superiority. His path to victory is clear: maintain distance and leverage his length and unorthodox striking. However, his defensive liabilities and questionable chin have been his downfall against powerful strikers. Azamat Murzakanov, while physically outmatched, is an undefeated power puncher. His path to victory involves closing the distance and landing a fight-altering blow. A critical variable is Murzakanov's inactivity; his last fight was in April 2023, and significant ring rust is a major concern against an active competitor like Walker.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the risk of fight cancellation and Walker's proven vulnerability to knockouts cannot be discounted. Murzakanov's power makes him a live underdog in any striking exchange.\n\nMy probability is not lower because Walker's physical advantages are simply too massive to ignore. Furthermore, Murzakanov's potential multi-year layoff is a severe disadvantage that could make him look slow and off-rhythm, playing directly into Walker's hands.\n\nI would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if the fight were officially confirmed, eliminating the cancellation risk. I would decrease it if reports indicated Murzakanov was in excellent shape and showing no signs of ring rust in training.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
