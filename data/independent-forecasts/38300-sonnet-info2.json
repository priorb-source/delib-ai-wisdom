  "information": "Forward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 13 days. The May 2025 industrial production data will be released and checked on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - positive year-over-year growth continues. April 2025 showed +1.48803% YoY growth, and the Real Economy Blog reports the industrial production index hit a record high. The recent trend has been positive.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production experiences a significant monthly decline in May 2025, or May 2024 had an unusually strong reading that creates a difficult comparison. This could occur if the Conference Board's sharply negative Leading Economic Index reading (-1.0%, the largest drop since March 2023) signals an abrupt downturn, combined with the core PPI decline indicating weakening demand.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production maintains relative stability from April to May 2025. The positive PMI readings (ISM manufacturing above 50 and rising S&P Global PMI) indicate continued expansion. Hard data proxies showing stability in hours worked, rail carloadings, and electricity output, combined with rebounding auto assemblies, support continued positive YoY growth even if modest.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. April 2025 registered healthy positive YoY growth at +1.48803%, and for this to flip to negative or zero in a single month would require either a significant shock or an unusually strong May 2024 comparison. The research assistant's report shows mixed but not uniformly negative signals. On the positive side: manufacturing PMIs remain in expansion territory and auto assemblies are rebounding after Q1 shutdowns. Hard data proxies (manufacturing hours, rail carloadings, electricity) are tracking close to April levels, suggesting stability rather than collapse. On the negative side: the LEI's 1.0% decline is concerning and the core PPI decline could signal weakening demand. However, economic trends typically exhibit persistence - they don't reverse quickly without major shocks, and there's no evidence of such a shock in May. The hard data suggesting flat to modest activity levels would likely maintain positive YoY growth given the April baseline. My forecast would be higher (85-90%) if all indicators were uniformly positive, but the LEI decline and PPI weakness introduce meaningful uncertainty. My forecast would be lower (60-70%) if we saw evidence of actual contraction in hard data or if April's reading had been barely positive instead of a solid +1.49%. To update higher, I would need to see stronger manufacturing data releases or confirmation that May's activity exceeded April's. To update lower, I would need evidence of an actual monthly decline in May or discovery that May 2024 had an exceptionally strong reading.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
