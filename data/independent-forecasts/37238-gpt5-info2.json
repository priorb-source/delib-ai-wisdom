    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (event date: June 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump’s schedule puts him elsewhere on June 7 (e.g., travel, official meetings), or security/political considerations lead the White House to skip a second high-profile UFC appearance so soon after the April Miami event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dana White invites him and he opts for a quick high-visibility appearance at Prudential Center in Newark—close to both Washington, D.C. and his Bedminster, NJ base—sitting cageside or appearing backstage during the O’Malley–Dvalishvili title rematch.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: UFC 316 is June 7, 2025 at Prudential Center (Newark). Trump has a long, public friendship with Dana White; he has repeatedly attended UFC cards and, per the provided NYT article, attended a UFC event in Miami on April 13, 2025 with members of his cabinet. Newark is a convenient location for him (proximity to Bedminster and the NYC media market). The main event (O’Malley–Dvalishvili) is marquee, which increases the incentive for a presidential drop-by.\n- Base rates: Trump does not attend every UFC PPV, but he has appeared at a substantial share of major U.S.-based cards in recent years (e.g., Miami, NYC, Las Vegas, Newark). A rough base-rate read is on the order of one-third to one-half of prime PPVs. For any single future event, the naive status quo is still “No,” because most events, even for him, are non-attendance events.\n- Why not higher: Uncertainty around his June 7 schedule, potential competing obligations, and the fact that he does not attend every PPV keep the probability well below certainty. Also, after an April appearance, advisors could judge another UFC stop so soon as unnecessary or risky.\n- Why not lower: Strong personal ties to Dana White, demonstrated pattern of frequent attendance at high-profile cards, and the convenient Newark location all push the probability above a simple base rate for a random PPV.\n- What would move it up: Credible reports of Trump planning to be at Bedminster that weekend; leaks or official hints from Dana White/UFC; local law enforcement preparing for a presidential visit; inclusion in media seating charts or security sweeps.\n- What would move it down: Official schedule placing him out of the region on June 7; conflicting summit/travel; health or security developments; reporting that he will not attend or that the event is proceeding without VIP accommodations for him.\n- Summary of assistant’s info used: Event date/location (June 7, Newark), headline bout, Trump–Dana White relationship and history of UFC involvement, and his April 2025 Miami attendance—all supportive of a higher-than-baseline chance but not a lock.",
