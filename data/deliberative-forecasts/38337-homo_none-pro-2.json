    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with each arriving at an identical 55% probability for the 'Yes' outcome. The core reasoning is consistent across all analyses: the labor market is undergoing a gradual cooling, and the recent 4-week moving average for initial jobless claims is hovering in a range (roughly 220,000-225,000) that places the 220,000 threshold very close to the central tendency. This makes the outcome for any single week highly susceptible to normal statistical noise. Forecaster 3 raised an excellent point that I had not explicitly articulated: the asymmetric risk distribution. An unexpected large layoff event can more easily cause an upside spike in claims for a single week than a corresponding event can cause a sudden, sharp downside deviation. This asymmetry provides a solid theoretical justification for nudging the forecast slightly above a 50/50 coin flip, reinforcing the 55% conclusion.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis is strongly affirmed by the deliberation process. The other forecasters independently reached the same conclusion based on the same publicly available data and macroeconomic context. The additional reasoning, particularly Forecaster 3's point about asymmetric risk, does not compel me to change my forecast but rather increases my confidence in its accuracy. It provides a more robust explanation for why a 55% probability is more appropriate than a 50% probability, even when the threshold is so close to the recent average. Since no new data or contradictory arguments were presented, and the consensus reasoning is sound, there is no basis for an update. I am maintaining my forecast.",
