    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. Cornwall Council elections are typically held in early May, making the election imminent from the current date of April 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Liberal Democrats win the most seats. Following the 2021 Cornwall Council election, the Liberal Democrats became the largest party with approximately 37 seats, ahead of Independents (32) and Conservatives (29). They currently lead the council in a minority administration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives stage a strong comeback, capitalizing on fragmented opposition and winning more seats than the Liberal Democrats. Alternatively, Independent candidates could surge if local issues dominate over party politics, or there could be a sufficient consolidation between Conservatives and Independents that either group surpasses the Liberal Democrats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats maintain their strong local organization and incumbency advantage in Cornwall. They benefit from their traditional strength in the Southwest, effective local campaigning, and their position as neither the governing Labour party nor the Conservative opposition nationally. Local voters continue to favor their blend of community focus and established presence.",
    "rationale": "The Liberal Democrats are the incumbent largest party on Cornwall Council, having won that position in 2021. This status quo provides a significant baseline probability for them retaining this position, as major shifts in local government composition typically occur gradually rather than dramatically between elections.\n\nKey factors supporting the forecast:\n1. Incumbency advantage: The Liberal Democrats have had four years to consolidate their position as the leading party\n2. Historical strength: Cornwall has been a competitive Liberal Democrat stronghold for decades, both locally and in parliamentary elections\n3. Status quo bias: Most forecasting errors come from overestimating change rather than continuity\n\nFactors that could lower the forecast:\n1. No recent polling data available to confirm current standing\n2. Cornwall has a strong Independent tradition, and Independents held 32 seats in 2021\n3. National political dynamics with Labour in government and Conservative opposition could affect local voting patterns\n4. Lack of specific information about local issues or candidate quality in 2025\n\nFactors that could raise the forecast:\n1. If polling showed Liberal Democrats with a commanding lead\n2. If there were evidence of Conservative or Independent collapse\n3. If recent by-elections showed Liberal Democrat strength\n\nWithout access to recent polling, local news about candidate selections, or specific campaign developments, I rely primarily on the status quo and historical patterns. The forecast is not higher because of uncertainty about current conditions and the viable challenge from both Conservatives and a large Independent bloc. It is not lower because unseating an incumbent largest party typically requires significant negative developments or strong opposition momentum, neither of which have been reported.\n\nTo update higher: Evidence of strong Liberal Democrat campaigning, favorable local polling, Conservative/Independent splits. To update lower: Polling showing they trail, strong Conservative recovery, or effective Independent coordination.",
