  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.\n\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nFollowing Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, as Johnny Walker has officially withdrawn from the fight.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker remains withdrawn from the UFC 316 card due to his injury. Azamat Murzakanov fights his replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, as scheduled. Because Walker does not fight Murzakanov, the question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an extremely unlikely sequence of events, Azamat Murzakanov's new opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, withdraws from the fight. Johnny Walker then makes a sudden and complete recovery, is medically cleared, and is re-booked to fight Murzakanov at UFC 316 on very short notice. Walker then proceeds to win the match.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on definitive and widely reported information that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from his scheduled fight against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 due to an injury. My research assistant's report confirms this with multiple sources, including MMA Fighting and RotoWire, all reporting the withdrawal in early May 2025. Furthermore, a replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, has already been officially signed and announced for Murzakanov. The UFC 316 fight card has been updated to reflect this change. According to the question's resolution criteria, if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, the outcome is 'No'. Given that the fight is cancelled and a replacement is in place, the status quo strongly supports a 'No' outcome. My probability is not 0 because forecasting abhors absolute certainty; a bizarre, last-minute series of events (e.g., the new opponent withdraws and Walker's injury was minor, allowing a quick return) is theoretically possible, though astronomically unlikely. My probability is not higher because the official cancellation and replacement of a fighter is a very strong and reliable indicator that the original bout will not proceed. For my forecast to change, there would need to be official news that Ribeiro is out AND Walker is medically cleared and re-instated, which is highly improbable with less than two weeks until the event.",
