    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025 - approximately 57 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint manages its cash runway, secures additional financing through equity raises or debt restructuring, implements cost-cutting measures to extend liquidity, or finds a strategic partner. The company continues operations through July 1, 2025 without needing bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces an immediate liquidity crisis due to worse-than-expected Q4/FY2025 results, inability to secure emergency financing, major customer defaults, or acceleration of debt obligations. The company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure operations and debt before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months) is the most important factor here. Companies rarely go from operating status to bankruptcy filing in such a brief window without clear, public warning signs. The status quo strongly favors no bankruptcy. The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the Q4/FY2025 results announcement, which suggests no immediate crisis signals are publicly apparent. Base rates for public company bankruptcy filings in any given 2-month period are very low - even for financially distressed companies, bankruptcy is a relatively rare outcome. However, I cannot assign an extremely low probability (1-2%) because: (1) the question specifically focuses on ChargePoint and references recent financial results, suggesting potential concern; (2) EV charging companies have faced sector headwinds; (3) the short timeframe reduces uncertainty but doesn't eliminate the tail risk of acute financial distress. For me to update significantly higher (above 20%), I would need evidence of: liquidity crisis, going concern warnings from auditors, debt covenant violations, or announcements of failed financing attempts. For me to update lower (below 3%), I would need evidence of: successful major fundraising, strong cash position disclosed, or strategic partnerships announced. Given the balance of these factors and the strong pull of the status quo over short timeframes, my forecast reflects low but non-trivial probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
