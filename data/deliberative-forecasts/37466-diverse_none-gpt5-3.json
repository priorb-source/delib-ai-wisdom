    "review": "Forecaster 2’s logic closely matches my prior view: strong status quo inertia, with a small nonzero chance due to WorldAtlas already acknowledging the alternative name in the article title. That’s reasonable and aligns with my baseline. Forecaster 3’s analysis hinges on a purported recent U.S. executive order changing the name; I’m not aware of such an order, and even if one existed, private sites aren’t obligated to adopt it, and international authorities still use “Gulf of Mexico.” This key premise appears incorrect or at least unsubstantiated, which makes their 40% estimate far too high. The presence of “(Gulf of America)” in an article title is consistent with SEO/editorial practice and does not imply imminent map relabeling on the North America page, which is likely a static or rarely updated asset.",
    "rationale": "About 54 days remain. The resolution hinges on the specific North America page displaying the body as “Gulf of America” (or using both names). Major atlas map labels are highly stable; changing a prominent continental map label without a strong external driver is rare. WorldAtlas’s acknowledgment of the alternative term on the article page modestly raises the probability above zero, but there’s no evidence of a broader naming shift or site-wide redesign. The U.S. view constraint also reduces the likelihood of a geolocated variant appearing only elsewhere. Given the short timeline and lack of catalysts, I maintain a very low probability. I would move up only with concrete signals: evidence of recent map-label updates on WorldAtlas, a redesign of the North America page, or adoption of dual naming on other site maps. I would move down if the site shows no changes by mid-June or if the parenthetical in the article is removed.",
