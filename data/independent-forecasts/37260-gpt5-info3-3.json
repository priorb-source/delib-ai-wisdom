  "information": "In January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – no ban is announced by the Federal Constitutional Court (or any authorized entity) before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No authorized body (Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government) files a ban application soon, or even if one is filed, the Federal Constitutional Court does not decide before July 1, 2025 (standard party-ban proceedings take many months to years).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An authorized body immediately files for a ban and the Federal Constitutional Court issues an unprecedented, ultra-expedited ruling banning the AfD within weeks. This would require a dramatic break with historical timelines and procedures, or an extreme constitutional emergency prompting the Court to act at record speed.",
    "rationale": "- Process and authority: Under Article 21(2) of Germany’s Basic Law, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party. The Interior Ministry can ban associations, not parties. Therefore, a Yes outcome requires an FCC ban announcement.\n- Timing: Party-ban cases are lengthy. The NPD case took years (2013 filing to 2017 decision). With roughly two months left, even a filing today would not produce a decision by July 1, 2025.\n- Political status quo: Per the research assistant, 124 MPs moved to initiate a ban procedure and the Bundestag debated it on Jan 30, 2025, but the motion lacked majority support and no immediate decision was expected. The federal government and Bundesrat also have authority but have shown caution historically. This makes even the filing of a case before July unlikely, let alone a decision.\n- Court caution and precedent: The FCC has been extremely reluctant to ban parties (only two bans in the 1950s). In 2017 it declined to ban the NPD, opting for other tools (e.g., later funding exclusion). This caution further reduces the likelihood of a swift ban.\n- Status quo weighting: Good forecasting practice places extra weight on the status quo; here, no filing + standard judicial timelines overwhelmingly favor No.\nWhy not higher? Because achieving Yes requires multiple low-probability steps (rapid filing, acceptance, and a lightning-fast ruling) that contradict legal norms and precedent.\nWhy not lower (not exactly zero)? To allow for tiny tail risks—an unforeseen, extraordinary constitutional crisis prompting unprecedented expedited action by the FCC.\nWhat would change my view upward? A formal ban application filed immediately by the Bundestag/Bundesrat/Federal Government, coupled with the FCC announcing an expedited schedule—though even then, I would only increase slightly given timeline constraints. Downward? Continued signals of political non-support for filing and absence of any court docket movement keep this effectively at ~0%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
