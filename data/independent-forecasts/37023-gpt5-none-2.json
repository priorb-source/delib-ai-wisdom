    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks until the preliminary May 2025 reading (likely around Fri, May 9–10). Final figure comes ~2–3 weeks after that, but preliminary will be enough to resolve.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (the April reading is 50.8; if conditions and sentiment remain essentially unchanged, the May figure would be at or below ~50.8, which does not clear the strict “greater than 50.8” threshold).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation and gas-price headlines stay negative through early May, equity markets wobble, and layoffs/claims tick up slightly. Consumers’ short-term inflation expectations rise or stay elevated, keeping expectations and current conditions indices depressed; the preliminary May ICS prints ≤50.8 (e.g., 48–50).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Energy prices stabilize or ease and markets firm up, media tone turns less inflation-focused, and labor-market data stay solid. With April’s shock already ‘priced in,’ sentiment mean-reverts a bit; the preliminary May ICS rebounds above 50.8 (e.g., 52–56).",
    "rationale": "April’s 50.8 was the second-lowest on record, implying an unusually bad shock (likely driven by hotter inflation data and higher gasoline prices). Two forces now compete: (1) status-quo inertia favors a similar reading, which would fail the strict “>50.8” test; (2) typical mean reversion after outsized monthly drops nudges probabilities toward at least a modest bounce. Because any uptick above 50.8 is enough for Yes, even a small rebound would suffice. However, the same drivers that produced April’s plunge—sticky inflation headlines, spring fuel price increases, geopolitical risk and market volatility—could persist into early May and keep sentiment at record-low territory or lower it further. With no new assistant-provided data beyond the April figure, I weight: - Status quo/negative-momentum risk (No) meaningfully, given inflation narrative and gas prices into May. - Mean reversion and noise (Yes) slightly more, given the extreme base and the tendency for partial rebounds after shock prints. Not higher: Because inflation news could remain adverse and consumers’ expectations can be sticky, making another sub-51 reading plausible. Not lower: Because 50.8 is already extraordinarily low; history often shows at least modest bounce-back after shock troughs. Updaters: - Up if: late-April/early-May gas prices retreat; equities stabilize; initial claims stay low; media tone on inflation cools; measures of inflation expectations ease. - Down if: gas prices rise further; additional hot-price data or salient inflation stories hit; equity pullbacks deepen; layoffs/claims worsen; geopolitical shocks intensify.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
