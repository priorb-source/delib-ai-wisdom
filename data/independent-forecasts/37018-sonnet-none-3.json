    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini wins at least one award in any of her three nominated categories at the ceremony",
    "rationale": "With 3 nominations, Ballerini has multiple opportunities to win an award. Using base rate reasoning, typical major award categories have 4-5 nominees, giving each nominee roughly a 20-25% chance per category. With three independent chances, the probability of winning at least one increases substantially. If we assume each nomination has approximately a 25% win probability, the probability of losing all three would be about 42%, meaning a 58% chance of winning at least one. However, several factors create uncertainty: I lack information about the specific categories, the strength of competition in each category, and Ballerini's recent momentum or voting trends. Ballerini is an established country artist with past ACM recognition, which suggests she's competitive. My forecast is not higher because without knowing the specific competition or categories, she could be facing strong favorites in all three nominations. My forecast is not lower because having three separate chances to win provides meaningful cumulative probability even with moderate individual win rates. I would update higher with information showing she's favored in any specific category or has strong recent performance momentum. I would update lower if data revealed she's competing against clear favorites in all three categories.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
