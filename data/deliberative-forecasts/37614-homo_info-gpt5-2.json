    "review": "Both forecasters strengthen the case for removal by emphasizing higher recall-success base rates (often >60% once on ballot) and the salience/severity of the allegation. Forecaster 2 adds the not-guilty plea and leave of absence—both relevant to perceptions of capacity and accountability. Forecaster 3 cites recent Colorado instances (if accurate) that suggest a locally receptive environment for recalls. I had acknowledged petition qualification and seriousness, but I underweighted the recall-specific base rate relative to generic incumbency advantage. I also like their reframing that, in recalls, the status quo tends to be removal unless countervailing evidence emerges. The only point I’m more cautious about is over-extrapolating from a few local examples and assuming low turnout in an all-mail context; still, in tiny electorates, motivated opposition often dominates.",
    "rationale": "Updating from 40% down to 33% to reflect: (1) stronger recall base rates against incumbents once on the ballot; (2) the highly emotive nature of the incident, unresolved felony charges, and negative publicity; and (3) the small electorate where an organized opposition can prevail. I keep the probability above 30% due to small-town idiosyncrasy, network effects, possible voter reluctance to remove before adjudication, and uncertainty about each side’s GOTV in a mail-ballot setting. No concrete countervailing signals (endorsements, favorable ballot-return data, or exculpatory legal developments) have surfaced to justify a higher survival estimate.",
