  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (Trading Economics will update after Ukraine’s April CPI release in early May 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight further acceleration: annual CPI edges up from 14.6% in March to at least 15.0% in April.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A soft April print (e.g., monthly CPI near 0.3–0.5%) combined with a relatively similar or higher April 2024 monthly base keeps YoY below 15% (e.g., 14.7–14.9%), possibly due to egg price reversal, stable fuel, and no new utility hikes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April monthly CPI is meaningfully above last April’s monthly increase (e.g., ~0.7–1.0% m/m or higher), driven by ongoing food/energy pressures, logistics constraints, and modest FX pass-through, pushing YoY to ≥15.0%.",
    "rationale": "Known data: Ukraine’s annual inflation rose from 12.9% (Jan) to 13.4% (Feb) and 14.6% (Mar). March’s monthly CPI was a strong 1.5%, the highest annual rate since May 2023. Food (+17.4% YoY), housing/utilities (+20.2% YoY), and spikes like eggs (+18.8% m/m) highlight broadening pressures. To reach 15.0% in April, the YoY only needs to rise ~0.4 pp from March. Using the approximation YoY_t ≈ YoY_{t-1} + (m/m_t − m/m_{t-12}), the key is whether April 2025’s monthly inflation exceeds April 2024’s. Given 2024’s spring inflation was generally subdued, last April’s monthly base was likely modest; if April 2025 prints around 0.7–1.0% m/m, YoY should tick up to or above 15%. Status quo/momentum favors a small further rise due to persistent food and utility pressures and ongoing wartime supply and energy constraints. Why not higher than my forecast: March’s 1.5% m/m surge included category spikes (e.g., eggs) that could partially reverse in April; seasonal normalization and any FX stability could produce a softer m/m, and if April 2024’s base was not especially low, the YoY may stall just under 15%. Why not lower: Only a modest m/m is needed to cross 15% given the 14.6% starting point and likely low prior-year base; structural pressures (energy infrastructure damage, logistics costs, administered price adjustments) argue against a very soft April. What would move me up: Evidence of sizable April m/m (e.g., weekly price indicators, reports of utility/fuel hikes, renewed FX depreciation, or continued strong food price gains). What would move me down: Clear signs of category reversals (eggs/food), discounts in clothing/footwear after March’s run-up, benign fuel/utilities, or indications that April 2024’s monthly base was unusually high.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
