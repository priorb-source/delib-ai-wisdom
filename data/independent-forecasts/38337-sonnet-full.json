  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.\n\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.\n\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21, 2025 will be released on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - claims will exceed 220,000. The most recent data shows claims at 247,000, well above the 220,000 threshold, with the four-week moving average at 235,000.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claims drop to 220,000 or below by June 21. This would require an 11% decline from current levels, possibly due to temporary factors driving the May spike, significant improvement in labor market conditions, or favorable seasonal adjustments reversing recent trends.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Claims remain elevated above 220,000. The current softening labor market trend continues, with ongoing corporate layoffs materializing in the data, economic uncertainty persisting, and no dramatic improvement in hiring activity over the next three weeks.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors claims exceeding 220,000. Current claims stand at 247,000 - already 27,000 above the threshold. The four-week moving average of 235,000 indicates this elevation is sustained rather than a one-week anomaly. Multiple indicators support continued weakness: job cuts are up 47% year-over-year, private sector job creation fell to just 37,000 in May (the lowest in a year), the Fed's Beige Book reports widespread economic uncertainty delaying hiring, and major corporations including P&G, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney have announced layoffs. The recent rise in claims represents the highest level in eight months, suggesting a meaningful deterioration rather than statistical noise. For a No outcome, claims would need to drop by approximately 11% in three weeks - a significant reversal that would require either the May spike being entirely temporary or a sharp improvement in economic conditions. Neither seems likely given the breadth of supporting evidence for labor market softening. Weekly claims data can exhibit volatility, and there's always uncertainty about seasonal adjustments, which prevents assigning near-certainty. However, the combination of elevated current levels, upward trend, high four-week average, and multiple confirming economic indicators makes it highly probable claims will remain above 220,000. I would revise upward if we see further deterioration in weekly data or additional major layoff announcements. I would revise downward if upcoming weekly data shows sharp improvement or if there's evidence the May spike was anomalous.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
