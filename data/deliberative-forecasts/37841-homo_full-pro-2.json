    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus on the key drivers of this question. We all identify the formal terrorism charge against a band member as the primary factor making a cancellation likely, while also recognizing Glastonbury's counter-cultural history as the main argument for the performance going ahead. The other forecasters raised two points that I found particularly convincing and had not weighted heavily enough. First, the emphasis on the practical security and liability risks of platforming an individual on terrorism charges at a festival for over 200,000 people. This goes beyond brand management to operational feasibility. Second, the explicit highlighting of the upcoming court date and the possibility that bail conditions could prohibit the performance, effectively taking the decision out of Glastonbury's hands. This provides a clean, non-political 'out' for the organizers. Their reasoning is highly persuasive and has prompted me to re-evaluate the weight I placed on the festival's ethos versus these practical and legal realities.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 40%, placing significant weight on Glastonbury's history of resisting establishment pressure. I reasoned that their brand is built on this kind of defiance, and they would be reluctant to bow to political demands. However, after reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe I under-weighted the practical and legal obstacles. The terrorism charge is not simply a matter of political controversy; it introduces severe operational challenges. As Forecaster 2 noted, the security implications for an event of this scale are immense, likely requiring cooperation with the same authorities investigating the band. Furthermore, as Forecaster 3 highlighted, the June 18 court date presents a significant chance the issue is resolved via bail conditions, which could forbid travel or public performance. This legal off-ramp makes a cancellation much more plausible. The combination of intense political pressure, precedent from other cancelled gigs, and these severe legal and security realities now seems more likely to force Glastonbury's hand than their cultural ethos is to resist it. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 5 points to align with the other forecasters, reflecting a greater conviction that the performance will be cancelled.",
