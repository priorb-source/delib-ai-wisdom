    "review": "My initial forecast of 20% was primarily driven by the short timeline, Governor DeWine's opposition, and the recent instance of Republicans removing a similar provision from a budget bill. Both other forecasters presented sound, similar arguments but arrived at higher probabilities (30% and 35%). Their analyses were convincing and caused me to re-evaluate my position. \n\nForecaster 3 raised two crucial points I had underweight: first, the resolution criteria defines 'enactment' as passage by both houses, making the governor's potential veto irrelevant to the outcome. I had incorrectly factored this in as a significant roadblock. Second, they highlighted the possibility of attaching the provision to a must-pass omnibus bill, which provides a plausible and accelerated path to passage that circumvents the slow progress of a standalone bill like SB 153. Forecaster 2 also gave more weight to the structural power of the supermajority and the sufficiency of the legislative calendar, which I now see as a more accurate assessment of the political reality. While we all agree that the February removal of the provision is the strongest piece of evidence against passage, the other forecasters correctly identified that the procedural and political power of the supermajority to overcome that setback is more significant than I had initially calculated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. My initial reasoning over-weighted Governor DeWine's stated hesitation, but as Forecaster 3 rightly pointed out, the question resolves on bicameral passage, not the governor's signature. This removes a key obstacle from the path to a 'Yes' resolution. I also underappreciated the procedural options available to the Republican supermajority, specifically the potential to attach this provision to a different, faster-moving omnibus bill rather than relying on the stalled SB 153.\n\nThe core tension remains: the demonstrated lack of consensus within the GOP (evidenced by the February removal of a similar provision) versus their immense structural power to act if they achieve consensus. The short timeline heightens this tension. However, the arguments presented by the other forecasters have convinced me that the path to enactment is more plausible than I first assessed. The combination of a powerful supermajority, an active group of sponsors, and procedural shortcuts like omnibus bills means that if legislative leadership decides to prioritize this, they have the means to pass it before the deadline. The February incident remains a powerful negative signal, preventing me from going as high as 35%, but the procedural realities compel me to raise my estimate. I am increasing my forecast from 20% to 30%, aligning with Forecaster 2 and acknowledging the strong points made by Forecaster 3.",
