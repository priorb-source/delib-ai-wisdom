    "no_outcome_scenario": "DOGE continues to identify and announce savings at a measured pace but only reaches $100-180 billion in claimed savings by July 1, 2025. Either they lack the methodology to justify such large claims or they take a more conservative approach to what qualifies as legitimate savings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DOGE announces a major comprehensive package of claimed savings in June 2025, reaching or exceeding $200 billion. This could include aggressive projections of future savings, broadly interpreted efficiency measures, and optimistic accounting methods. Given political pressures to demonstrate significant impact, DOGE makes bold claims about waste reduction across multiple government departments.",
    "rationale": "With only 31 days until the resolution date, the timeline is extremely compressed. The key insight is that this resolves based on what DOGE *claims* on their website, not verified or actual savings, which lowers the bar significantly. Political incentives strongly favor making impressive numerical claims, especially given Elon Musk's involvement and the desire to demonstrate effectiveness. However, $200 billion represents roughly 3% of the entire federal budget - an enormous sum that would require identifying massive inefficiencies. The reference article mentions estimates of 'over $100 billion' in waste, suggesting current thinking is below the $200 billion threshold. The status quo heavily favors NO - if DOGE were close to $200 billion in claims already, they would likely have announced it. The complete lack of information from the research assistant suggests there isn't clear public reporting showing DOGE approaching this threshold. Strong political incentives could drive aggressive accounting and broad interpretations of 'savings,' but even claims need some plausible basis. For the probability to be higher, I would need evidence that DOGE has already claimed $100+ billion in savings. For it to be lower, I would need confirmation they're well below $100 billion with no major announcements planned. Given the short timeline, political incentives for bold claims, but the sheer magnitude of $200 billion, I estimate a 30% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
