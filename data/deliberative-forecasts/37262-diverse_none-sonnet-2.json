    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical point I underweighted: tracker selectivity and coding practices. While Forecasters 2 and I focused on whether large protests will occur in India (fairly likely given population size and current unrest), Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes the multiple gating factors: (1) protests must occur, (2) reach 10,000+ participants, (3) be salient enough for tracker inclusion, and (4) be coded with a specific size rather than 'unknown.' The empirical claim that India appears only 'a handful of times per year' on the tracker—implying perhaps 20-35% baseline probability over 2 months—is a stronger analytical approach than my implicit assumption that India's general protest frequency translates directly to tracker appearances. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 10,000 threshold being 'relatively low' is valid but misses that the bottleneck is tracker documentation, not actual protest occurrence. However, I think Forecaster 3 may be slightly too conservative given the concrete catalyst: the April 14 Muslim land law protests with fatalities suggest an ongoing, media-salient issue that increases the probability of tracker-worthy events above the baseline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the arguments, I'm updating downward primarily based on Forecaster 3's tracker selectivity analysis. My original reasoning conflated 'protests happening' with 'tracker recording them.' The Global Protest Tracker's selectivity is a real constraint I insufficiently weighted. Even substantial protests may not be added, or may be coded with 'unknown' size. That said, I'm not moving all the way to 34% because: (1) the April 14 violence around the Muslim land law represents an active, combustible situation with international media coverage—exactly the type of salient event the tracker would be more likely to document; (2) the Reuters coverage suggests this isn't just localized unrest but potentially broader mobilization; (3) over a 2-month window with an active catalyst, the probability of at least one tracker-worthy event exceeds the baseline. My updated forecast splits the difference, acknowledging tracker selectivity as a major constraint while giving appropriate weight to current elevated risk.",
