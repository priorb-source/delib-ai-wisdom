    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial estimate. They correctly emphasize several critical points I underweighted: (1) the dual requirement - China must not only implement a blockade but the US must also publicly accuse them of it; (2) the distinction between exercises simulating blockades (current status quo, described as 'regular occurrence') versus actual implementation; (3) the detectability of actual blockade positioning, which would provide advance warning; and (4) explicit base rate reasoning showing such dramatic escalations are historically rare. Their convergence at 4% from independent analyses is notable. However, I'm not convinced 4% is the right level - it may underweight tail risk given recent April 2025 escalations and the inherent unpredictability of geopolitical crises in an already tense environment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward but not to their 4% level. Their strongest arguments are: (1) the dual-condition requirement creates two failure points for a Yes resolution; (2) the 56-day window is genuinely short for such a dramatic shift; (3) China is currently achieving strategic objectives through exercises without crossing into actual conflict. However, I maintain slight disagreement on the tail risk assessment. While 4% appropriately captures the low base rate, the recent April 2025 escalation occurred just a month ago, suggesting we're in a period of elevated tension. Additionally, geopolitical crises can escalate non-linearly - the gap between 'regular exercises' and 'actual blockade' is large but not insurmountable given the right trigger (Taiwan political developments, accident/miscalculation, deliberate Chinese decision). My updated forecast of 6% represents a meaningful downward revision acknowledging their valid critiques while maintaining slightly higher weight on unexpected escalation scenarios than their 4% estimates.",
