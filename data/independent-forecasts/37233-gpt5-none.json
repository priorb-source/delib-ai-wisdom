    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of now he has not declared, and incumbents in Côte d’Ivoire often keep options open until closer to the election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues strategic ambiguity through May; RHDP delays formal nomination to later in the summer, or he signals a successor without a personal declaration. He could also announce after June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP holds a May congress/rally and formally nominates Ouattara, with him publicly accepting; or he gives a speech/interview in May explicitly declaring his candidacy and the party amplifies it with an official communiqué.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With roughly a month left, the base case is that no declaration occurs before June. In 2020, Ouattara’s declaration came relatively late; parties in the region often time announcements closer to filing deadlines and peak campaign season. If the election is expected in October, there is limited tactical need to declare by May. \n- Incentives: RHDP benefits from keeping opponents guessing while consolidating structures and testing public/elite reaction. Conversely, a May declaration would make sense only if a party congress is scheduled and the leadership has decided to lock in the incumbent early. \n- Signals: Public reporting in early 2025 has been ambiguous about his intentions; there’s been speculation the party wants him to run, but no widely reported hard commitment from Ouattara. Absent confirmed plans for a May convention or an announced decision date, the path to a pre–June 1 declaration looks less likely than not. \n- Status quo weighting: The world changes slowly; absent a clear, dated party event in May designed for a nomination, the default is slippage into June or later. \n- Why not higher? Because there’s no firm, credible public schedule tying him to a May announcement, and past precedent favors later declarations. \n- Why not lower? Because a May RHDP congress or coordinated call from party organs that he explicitly accepts could happen, and incumbency advantages make a fourth run conceivable. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an RHDP extraordinary congress or nomination convention in May with Ouattara slated to speak, a published agenda to designate the candidate, or leaks from senior RHDP figures that he will accept the party’s call within May. \n- What would move me down: A clear statement from Ouattara that he won’t run, an RHDP move to elevate/nominate a successor before June, health concerns, or legal/political developments that make a candidacy less viable. \n- Research assistant: No additional information available; forecast relies on general timelines, regional patterns, and known political context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Alassane Ouattara declares his candidacy for the [2025 Ivorian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election), according to credible sources, before June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
