  "information": "Kelvin Gastelum is a veteran fighter and the winner of 'The Ultimate Fighter 17'. The fight at UFC 316 will mark his 24th appearance in the UFC Octagon. He has won two of his last three fights, with his most recent competition being a unanimous decision victory over Daniel Rodriguez in June 2024 at UFC Saudi Arabia.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The event is scheduled for June 28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum proceeds as scheduled, and Pyfer, as the younger fighter with significant momentum and power, is favored to win.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight is cancelled for a second time due to injury, illness, or weight-cutting issues for either fighter. Alternatively, the fight occurs, but Kelvin Gastelum's veteran experience, durability, and well-rounded skillset prove to be too much for Pyfer, resulting in a Gastelum victory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rebooked fight goes ahead as planned at UFC 316, and Joe Pyfer uses his notable punching power to overwhelm and defeat Kelvin Gastelum, likely via knockout or TKO.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on two primary factors: the probability of the fight occurring and the probability of Pyfer winning if it does. First, MMA fights have a significant cancellation rate, and this specific bout has already been cancelled once. I estimate roughly a 25% chance the fight does not happen, which would resolve this question as 'No'. Second, if the fight does happen, Joe Pyfer is the likely favorite. He is the younger, more powerful athlete. However, the provided research highlights that Kelvin Gastelum is a highly experienced veteran coming off a win, representing a significant step up in competition for Pyfer. Pyfer's only recent loss came against another durable veteran, Jack Hermansson, which suggests Gastelum has a clear path to victory. I estimate Pyfer has approximately a 70% chance of winning the bout if it occurs. Combining these probabilities (75% chance of fight happening * 70% chance of Pyfer winning) results in a 52.5% probability for a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher due to the substantial risk of cancellation and Gastelum's proven durability and experience, which makes him a very dangerous opponent. It is not lower because Pyfer's fight-ending power and athletic advantages make him the rightful favorite. I would increase my forecast if reports indicate Gastelum is having a difficult training camp, and I would decrease it if any news suggests Pyfer is injured or if the fight is changed to a five-round main event, which would favor the veteran.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
