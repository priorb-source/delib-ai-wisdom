    "review": "Forecaster 3’s point about late-May Morning Consult levels (Starmer ~28%, Ishiba ~32%) is the most decision-relevant update: if Ishiba currently leads by ~4 points and the series is a 7-day average, persistence plus the tie-as-No rule bias the base case toward No. I broadly agree with their 35%. Forecaster 2 makes a strong case on Ishiba’s structural weakness and cites Asahi’s cabinet-approval dip, but that’s a different metric from Morning Consult’s leader-approval and from March; given reported late-May Morning Consult readings showing Ishiba ahead, their 76% Yes feels too high and underweights both current ordering and the tie-to-No rule. I also think F2 underweights near-term UK downside catalysts (June 11 spending review) and overstates the likelihood of a sharp Ishiba rebound being needed when he may already be ahead on MC.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~1 month and Morning Consult’s 7-day moving average dampens late swings. The most relevant status quo (per F3) is Ishiba ~32 vs. Starmer ~28 in late May—i.e., a No today. To get to Yes by July 1, Starmer likely needs a net 3–5 point swing relative to Ishiba within weeks. That’s possible, but not the modal outcome absent a clear catalyst. Near-term events look asymmetric: UK’s June 11 spending review and civil service cuts risk negative coverage, while a potential BoE cut could help sentiment but may not flow through quickly to leader approval. Japan has two-sided risks (yen weakness, LDP trust issues vs. spring wage hike headlines/inflation relief), but with Ishiba already modestly ahead, he doesn’t need improvement—just to avoid a meaningful drop. The tie-as-No rule further trims the path to Yes. Net: the new information (late-May MC levels) makes Yes modestly less likely than my prior 35%, so I edge down.",
