  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — attend as officially confirmed and expected",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute cancellation or substitution (e.g., sends VP/Secretary of State) due to a domestic emergency, acute health issue, security concern, or diplomatic rupture leading him to skip summit events where other heads of state are physically present.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague and participates in summit events (e.g., plenary/family photo/bilats on-site) where he is physically co-present with other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "Multiple early-June reports indicate the White House has officially confirmed President Trump will attend the NATO Summit in The Hague, echoed by allied officials (Dutch PM Dick Schoof after a call with Trump; Poland’s FM Sikorski stating Trump will be present). This is strong evidence and establishes the status quo as attendance. Historically, once a US presidential trip to a major alliance summit is publicly confirmed, attendance is very likely; cancellations do happen but are uncommon and usually tied to acute domestic crises (e.g., government shutdowns), major security concerns, or health issues. Trump’s prior behavior includes attending NATO summits while being critical of the alliance, suggesting he values the platform and leverage such events provide. That said, Trump’s unpredictability slightly elevates cancellation risk versus a typical president, and there is always tail risk from sudden crises or strategic decisions to send a surrogate. I therefore put substantial weight on the status quo but keep a non-trivial downside. I would raise the probability further upon release of detailed official schedules, departure (“wheels up”) reports, or pool notes confirming his travel to Europe and on-the-ground presence at summit venues. I would lower it if credible reports emerge of a change in plans, a domestic emergency, health issues, or a security advisory that materially alters the trip.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
