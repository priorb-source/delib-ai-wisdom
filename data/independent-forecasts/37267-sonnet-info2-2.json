  "information": "The US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3 - Reconsider Travel) through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia maintains relative stability in major population centers including Addis Ababa. While some regional tensions and security concerns persist, there are no major incidents affecting American citizens or interests. The US embassy continues normal operations. The State Department sees no need to escalate the advisory to Level 4, keeping Ethiopia at its current Level 3 status through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe security crisis emerges such as: a major terrorist attack affecting foreigners, significant escalation of internal conflict spreading to previously stable areas, an incident involving American citizens being taken hostage or killed, ordered departure of US embassy staff due to imminent threats, closure of Addis Ababa airport, or a military coup creating widespread instability. Such events would trigger an immediate upgrade to Level 4.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. According to the research assistant's data, only 2-4 countries are upgraded from Level 3 to Level 4 annually out of 25-35 Level 3 countries, yielding a base rate of approximately 6-16% per year. With only 2 months remaining (roughly 17% of a year), the base rate probability would be around 1-3%. However, I need to adjust slightly upward from pure base rates given Ethiopia's specific context. The country has experienced significant internal conflicts including the Tigray war, ethnic tensions, and regional instability. The question background references 'new travel warnings in 2025,' suggesting some recent deterioration in the security situation. That said, Level 4 upgrades require severe catalysts - the research assistant notes these include coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents, or embassy evacuations. Currently, there are no public indications of such imminent crises in Ethiopia. The US embassy appears to be operating normally, and while security concerns exist, they haven't reached the threshold requiring a Level 4 designation. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the historical base rate is low, (2) the time window is very short for such escalation, (3) there are no current signs of the severe catalysts that typically trigger Level 4, and (4) the world changes slowly most of the time. My forecast is not lower because: (1) Ethiopia does face genuine security challenges, (2) the region is volatile enough that rapid deterioration is possible, and (3) the reference to new 2025 warnings suggests some concerning trends. I would revise upward if: reports emerge of major conflict escalation, threats to the US embassy, or incidents involving American citizens. I would revise downward if: the security situation demonstrably stabilizes or peace agreements are reached.",
