  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5-2 months until May 2025 data is published by FRED, likely in late June or early July 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if the current trend continues, inventory would reach approximately 507,000-509,000 in May 2025, remaining below the 550,000 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory continues growing at the recent pace of 1-3k units per month, reaching approximately 507-509k by May. Sales absorb new listings at a steady rate, and the sharp decline in housing starts (-14.2% in March) and building permits (-2%) limits new supply additions to the market",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A dramatic acceleration in inventory buildup occurs, requiring growth of 47,000 units (23,500/month) over two months versus the recent 3,000/month pace. This would require either a severe demand collapse while completions from earlier pipeline surge, or an unprecedented seasonal spike combined with frozen sales activity",
    "rationale": "The current March 2025 inventory sits at 503,000 units, requiring a 47,000 unit increase (9.3% growth) over just two months to exceed 550,000. This would necessitate roughly 8x acceleration from the recent growth rate of 3,000 units per month. Several key factors work strongly against this outcome: (1) Housing starts plummeted 14.2% month-over-month in March to 940k units, indicating fewer homes entering the pipeline; (2) Building permits declined 2%, suggesting continued supply constraints ahead; (3) Builder confidence remains depressed at 42 on the NAHB index; (4) Sales are occurring at a healthy 724k annual rate, helping absorb inventory. Historically, the 550k+ threshold has only been breached during the 2006-2007 housing bubble peak (570-580k range), making it an extreme outlier. While spring/summer typically sees seasonal inventory increases, the fundamental supply indicators (declining starts and permits) strongly suggest the pipeline is slowing, not accelerating. Mortgage rates rising from 6.65% to 6.83% could dampen demand somewhat, but would need to trigger a near-complete market freeze combined with a completion surge to reach 550k. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: collapsing sales velocity, a large backlog of completions hitting the market simultaneously, or economic shock freezing buyer activity. For it to move lower, I would need: inventory growth stalling in April data, sales acceleration, or further declines in construction activity. The 12% probability reflects that while not impossible, reaching 550k would require extreme deviation from current trends and fundamentals within a very short 2-month window.",
