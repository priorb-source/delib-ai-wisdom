    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 2 highlights the US military withdrawal from Niger following the 2023 coup and the junta's Russia alignment, which reduces US visibility and presence. Forecaster 3 notes the six-month review cycle for advisories (though the last formal update was March 2023, raising questions about review timing) and emphasizes that consular capacity is the key factor, not just general security conditions. Both identify specific trigger mechanisms: ordered departure of embassy staff, major attacks on Westerners in Niamey, or suspension of consular services. All three of us cluster in the 20-30% range, suggesting reasonable convergence on the base dynamics. The most significant new information is the US military withdrawal, which directly affects the US government's ability to assist citizens - a key factor in Level 4 determinations. However, the embassy remains operational without reported drawdowns.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward but remain close to my original forecast. The US military withdrawal is indeed significant new information that reduces overall US presence and capacity, which is explicitly relevant to travel advisory determinations. The junta's pivot toward Russia adds unpredictability. These factors create somewhat more upside risk than I initially weighted. However, several factors keep me from moving substantially higher: (1) The 2+ year stability of the Level 3 designation remains the strongest evidence - the State Department has deliberately maintained this level through the coup, military withdrawal, and ongoing regional instability; (2) The embassy continues normal operations with no reported ordered/authorized departure or significant consular service reductions; (3) There's no current reporting suggesting an imminent review or policy change; (4) The 60-day timeframe genuinely favors the status quo in bureaucratic decision-making absent a major shock. While the security environment is fragile and could deteriorate rapidly, predicting a specific trigger event within 60 days remains highly uncertain. The deliberate calibration of specific Level 4 zones within Niger while maintaining nationwide Level 3 suggests thoughtful policy rather than oversight.",
