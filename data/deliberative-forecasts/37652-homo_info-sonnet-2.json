    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully considered. Most significantly, Forecaster 3 provides specific pre-election approval data showing Carney at 48% approval (or 71% by some measures) versus 30% disapproval in March 2025, and notes that 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump. This concrete baseline data strengthens the case for a Yes outcome. All forecasters correctly identify that July 1 is exactly 2 months and 3 days after Carney's April 28 election victory - prime honeymoon period territory. Forecaster 3 raises a legitimate technical concern about whether Morning Consult will have begun tracking Carney yet, which could cause a technical No resolution. However, given Morning Consult's professional scope and that they track G7 leaders, they should certainly be tracking the Canadian PM by 2+ months into their tenure. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 65-72% range suggests this is a well-calibrated estimate. The specific data about Canadian anti-Trump sentiment and Carney's pre-election approval strengthen the fundamentals of the Yes case more than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward. The key factors driving this update are: (1) Specific pre-election data showing Carney with strong approval ratings (48-71%) provides a concrete baseline I lacked; (2) The 77% of Canadians holding negative views of Trump strengthens the domestic political advantage Carney gains from standing firm against Trump; (3) The precise timing - exactly 2 months post-election on July 1 - places Carney at the peak of typical honeymoon periods; (4) The consensus among forecasters in the 65-72% range suggests appropriate calibration. However, I'm not going as high as 72% because: (1) We still lack current May 2025 polling data for either leader; (2) The Morning Consult tracking concern, while likely overstated, introduces some technical risk; (3) 1.5 months still provides time for significant events that could shift public opinion; (4) Carney's deficit spending plans could dampen enthusiasm even during the honeymoon period. The fundamentals strongly favor Yes, but appropriate uncertainty remains about the specific July 1 snapshot.",
