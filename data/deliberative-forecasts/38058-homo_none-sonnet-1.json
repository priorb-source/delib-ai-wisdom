    "review": "All three forecasts cluster between 28-48%, suggesting general agreement on moderate-but-below-even-odds probability. The most important new information is that we're 7 days into the resolution window (since May 19) and the question hasn't resolved YES yet, meaning tariffs have appeared on at least one front page every single day. This 100% coverage rate in the first week is strong empirical evidence of exceptional persistence - more than just theoretical prominence.\n\nForecaster 2's 28% appropriately weights this demonstrated staying power against the word-specific criterion and 35-day window. Forecaster 3's 48% seems too optimistic given the perfect coverage record so far - if tariffs appeared 100% of the first 7 days, expecting them to disappear for even one day in the next 35 requires assuming either a dramatic shift in newsworthiness or exceptional displacement by breaking news.\n\nThe word-specific criterion is important - papers could discuss trade policy using alternative terminology. However, the front page includes multiple sections beyond headlines (business/finance summaries), increasing opportunities for the word to appear. The dual requirement (both papers simultaneously) also makes this harder than single-paper tracking.",
    "rationale": "The empirical evidence from the first week significantly updates my prior. A 100% appearance rate across 7 days suggests tariffs are even more dominant than the question background implied. While 35 remaining days provides meaningful opportunity for displacement, the demonstrated persistence argues for a lower probability than my initial 38%.\n\nUsing a simplified model: if tariffs appear with 97-98% daily probability (consistent with 100% observed plus some regression to mean), the probability of at least one tariff-free day in 35 days would be approximately 40-51%. However, I need to discount this because: (1) the 100% rate may indicate even higher persistence; (2) both papers must omit simultaneously; (3) front pages include multiple sections.\n\nBalancing the favorable odds structure (only one day needed, word-specific criterion, long window) against the strong empirical baseline and structural factors (dual requirement, business-focused papers, ongoing policy story), I'm revising down to account for demonstrated persistence while maintaining that one displacement day in 35 remains plausible.",
