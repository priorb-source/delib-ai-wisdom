    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critical new evidence I hadn't fully considered: the 45% year-over-year drop in China-US shipping bookings is a very strong bearish signal, and the April 2 tariff implementation represents a clear economic shock. However, their forecast may be too pessimistic because (1) shipping bookings are forward-looking and may not fully reflect April's actual exports, which likely include pre-tariff orders, and (2) China-specific data doesn't capture the full picture of US export destinations.\n\nForecaster 3 provides crucial missing data: February 2025 total exports at $278.5B, already 6% above the April 2024 threshold of $262.6B. This is a significant buffer that strengthens the case for Yes. Their point about distinguishing net exports from absolute export levels is important - trade deficits widening doesn't necessarily mean exports are falling in absolute terms. However, their 85% forecast may underweight the severity of the tariff shock that occurred on April 2, right at the beginning of the measurement period.\n\nThe key tension is timing: April exports likely reflect a mix of pre-tariff orders (booked in Feb/March) being fulfilled and early tariff impacts. The February cushion of $16B (6%) provides significant downside protection, but the 45% China shipping drop suggests substantial headwinds materialized quickly.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast upward from 65% to 70%. The decisive factor is Forecaster 3's data point that February 2025 total exports were already $278.5B - a full 6% or $16B above the April 2024 threshold. For April to fall below threshold, exports would need to drop substantially from recent levels.\n\nWhile Forecaster 2's evidence of the 45% China-US shipping drop and April 2 tariff shock is concerning, three factors mitigate this:\n\n1. **Timing lag**: April exports likely include substantial pre-tariff orders placed in February-March. The full tariff impact may manifest more in May-June data.\n\n2. **Services stability**: Services exports ($70-85B monthly) are less vulnerable to goods tariffs and provide a stabilizing floor.\n\n3. **Geographic diversification**: The China shipping data, while alarming, is specific to one trading partner. EU, Latin America, and other regions may show different patterns.\n\nThe March goods export data (+6.8% YoY) combined with the February total export cushion suggests momentum was strong entering April. Even with tariff headwinds, it would require an unusually sharp one-month reversal to erase this advantage.\n\nMy forecast remains below Forecaster 3's 85% because the tariff shock is real and the shipping data indicates genuine trade disruption, but above Forecaster 2's 15% because the buffer is substantial and timing lags matter for trade data.",
