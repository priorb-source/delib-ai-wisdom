    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was an outlier compared to the other forecasters' 7% and 8%. Both other experts presented compelling arguments that I find persuasive. They rightly placed greater emphasis on the powerful historical precedent of US rhetorical restraint, even during major crises like the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. Their arguments about the 'stickiness' of diplomatic norms (Forecaster 2) and the extremely high legal and political threshold for declaring a 'blockade' (Forecaster 3) have convinced me that I was underweighting the strong institutional incentives within the US government to avoid using this specific, highly escalatory term. Forecaster 3 also introduced a valuable, specific flashpoint—the May 20 inauguration in Taiwan—which helps structure thinking about when an event might occur, but they still concluded the probability was low, reinforcing the strength of US verbal discipline.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 15% to 10%. The core reason is that the other forecasters have convinced me that I underestimated the US government's strong aversion to using the word 'blockade.' The term is tantamount to an act of war, and the US would likely exhaust every other descriptor ('coercion,' 'intimidation,' 'dangerous and provocative actions') before using it, even if China's actions were severe. The historical precedent and the diplomatic incentives for restraint are more powerful than I had initially weighted.\n\nHowever, I am not lowering my forecast to match the 7-8% consensus. I am holding at 10% for two key reasons. First, Forecaster 3 raised the excellent point about the US potentially using the term 'de facto blockade.' This provides a linguistic pathway for a 'Yes' resolution that is less escalatory than a formal declaration, making it a more plausible action for the US to take in response to Chinese aggression. Second, I continue to believe the risk of a Chinese miscalculation or a deliberate test—such as physically turning away commercial vessels from a port for a limited time—is a non-trivial possibility in the short, two-month window. Such an unambiguous action would put immense pressure on the US to call it what it is. My 10% forecast reflects my new appreciation for US rhetorical restraint while still accounting for the escalating reality of PLA actions and the possibility of a 'de facto blockade' accusation.",
