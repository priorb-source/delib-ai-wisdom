    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with probabilities tightly clustered between 90% and 92%. We all rely on the same core thesis: the principle of macroeconomic inertia, a positive anchor from the April 2025 year-over-year growth of ~1.5%, and the crucial fact that May 2025 has passed without any reports of a major economic shock. The arguments presented by the other two forecasters are highly aligned with my own and are convincing. Forecaster 3's characterization of the ~1.5% buffer as \"not exceptionally strong\" is a valid point that justifies the small degree of uncertainty we all share, and likely explains their slightly more conservative 90% forecast. However, no new evidence or fundamentally different line of reasoning was introduced that would compel me to change my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 92% remains unchanged. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in my initial analysis. All forecasters agree that a 'No' outcome would require a significant, negative deviation from the recent trend. My own quick analysis shows that for the year-over-year figure to turn negative, the month-over-month industrial production index would have to fall by approximately 1.3% from April to May 2025. A monthly contraction of this magnitude is a rare event, typically associated with a recessionary shock, for which there is currently no evidence. The other forecasters' analyses confirm this view. The existing consensus validates that an 8-10% chance of a negative outcome is an appropriate assessment of the risk, which stems from statistical noise, potential base effects, and the possibility of minor, unobserved sector weakness. Given that my initial forecast of 92% (implying an 8% chance of a 'No' outcome) sits at the higher end of the expert consensus, I am comfortable maintaining it as it accurately reflects my view of the low but non-zero probability of a negative surprise.",
