  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~6 months (about 182 days) until the expected Oct 20, 2025 election date",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Conservatives remain ahead nationally; Liberals finish well below 172 seats",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives maintain a sizable national lead into the writ and through the campaign; Liberals underperform in Ontario suburbs, lose/share ground with the Bloc in Quebec and the NDP in urban cores; vote splits prevent Liberal sweeps in key regions. Result: Liberal seat count closer to 2019/2021 levels or lower, far short of 172.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking Liberal resurgence: either a leadership change that improves favorables markedly, or a major CPC stumble that shifts Ontario and Quebec decisively. Bloc support weakens, NDP vote collapses in Ontario metros, and Liberals efficiently convert a narrow popular-vote edge into large seat gains across ON/QC and Atlantic Canada, approximating a 2015-style wave to reach 172+.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo because Canadian federal voting intentions have been relatively stable over long stretches, and seat outcomes are path-dependent on regional vote distributions. As of late 2024, reputable aggregators (including 338Canada) showed the Conservatives with a persistent and often double‑digit lead, translating into a projected CPC majority and a Liberal caucus well below 172 seats. Barring a dramatic reversal, that baseline still governs six months out. Hitting 172 requires not just eking out a majority but approaching the scale of the 2015 Liberal wave (184 seats), which demands broad and efficient gains in Ontario and Quebec plus resilience in Atlantic Canada. That is a high bar given recent fundamentals: Liberal leader/net approval headwinds, fundraising gaps, housing and cost‑of‑living salience favoring the CPC, and unfavorable Ontario suburban dynamics. The research assistant’s note claims 338Canada currently projects 188–196 Liberal seats and a 40–45% Liberal national lead eight days from “resolution.” That conflicts with (1) the fixed Oct 2025 election date and (2) the multi‑year polling trend. Without independent corroboration, I place very low weight on that report; if accurate, it would dramatically alter the forecast, but it likely reflects outdated or erroneous inputs. Why not higher? To clear 172, the Liberals need a sustained and sizable polling lead concentrated in ON/QC with superior vote efficiency and minimal leakage to the NDP/Bloc — conditions not in evidence in the longer‑run data. Why not lower? Canadian campaigns can shift quickly; an unexpected leadership transition, a major CPC scandal/misstep, or a salient policy announcement (e.g., on housing/affordability) could realign Ontario and Quebec. Moreover, first‑past‑the‑post can amplify regional swings. What would move me up: • Multiple independent national polls over 3–4 weeks showing Liberals leading by 3–5 points nationally and 5–8 in Ontario, plus Quebec seat models showing Bloc weakness; • 338Canada/other models’ median projections ≥172 seats; • Material improvement in Liberal leader favourables and fundraising parity; • Evident CPC campaign errors that shift undecideds. What would move me down: • Continued CPC double‑digit national lead; • Liberal underperformance in GTA and 905 polling; • Bloc stability/strength in Quebec; • Worsening Liberal fundraising, high‑profile retirements, or new negative shocks.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
