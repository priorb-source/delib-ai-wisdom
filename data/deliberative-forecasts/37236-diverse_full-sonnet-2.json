    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I missed: the 45% decline in China-US bookings likely refers to imports FROM China to the US (the stockpiling mentioned in the research), not US exports TO China. This significantly weakens what I considered a key indicator of export collapse. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes the meaningful cushion - February's $278.5B vs the $262.6B threshold provides ~$16B margin. For April to resolve No, total exports would need to drop by more than $16B from recent levels. With services typically at ~$95B monthly and more tariff-resistant, goods would need to fall from March's $180.8B to below $167.6B - a decline exceeding $13B or 7%. While Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns closely with my original analysis, both of us may have overweighted the tariff shock relative to the structural cushion and historical baseline (79-93% of Aprils show YoY gains). However, I'm not fully convinced by Forecaster 3's 74% - the retaliatory measures from multiple countries, manufacturing PMI contraction, and unprecedented tariff timing still represent meaningful downside risks that shouldn't be dismissed.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis with corrected interpretation: The China booking decline primarily reflects US import contraction, not export collapse. This removes a key pillar of my bearish case. The mathematical cushion is significant: if services hold steady at ~$95B (tariff-resistant), goods exports can drop 7% from March's $180.8B and still exceed threshold. March showed goods up 6.8% YoY despite pre-tariff uncertainty. Historical precedent strongly favors Yes. However, meaningful risks remain: (1) Retaliatory tariffs from multiple countries specifically target US exports; (2) Manufacturing PMI contraction indicates real economic weakness; (3) April 2-30 captures nearly full month of tariff regime; (4) Agricultural, industrial supplies, and capital goods exports vulnerable to retaliation. The question is whether these factors can overcome a $16B cushion in one month. Large single-month swings in goods exports ($10B+) are uncommon but possible under policy shocks. Services provide ballast. Balancing the meaningful cushion and historical strength against genuine tariff/retaliation risks, I should materially increase my forecast from 32% but remain below Forecaster 3's 74%. The evidence supports goods exports declining but likely not catastrophically in a single month.",
