    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operating and executes on cost controls and product roadmap while managing liquidity with existing cash, receivables, and normal vendor terms; no imminent debt maturity forces a filing before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity crisis occurs—e.g., failed refinancing of a near-term maturity or convertible notes, a sharp revenue shortfall leading to covenant breaches, vendor credit tightening, or an adverse legal/judgment event—prompting an emergency Chapter 11 (or other chapter) filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Timing and base rates: With only ~7 weeks left, and no public indication that GoPro has filed to date, the base case is that no bankruptcy occurs before July 1. Corporate bankruptcies typically have visible precursors (missed interest/principal payments, forbearance notices, going-concern warnings, urgent exchange offers, or public negotiations with creditors). There has been no widely reported signal of that magnitude for GoPro as of today.\n\nRecent information: The prompt references GoPro’s Q4 and 2024 results. While I am not inserting specific figures, the mere fact of a standard results release (rather than distress communications) and the absence of announced default events lowers the near-term filing probability. My research assistant provided no additional information.\n\nCompany profile and risk factors: GoPro is a small-cap consumer electronics company with revenue pressure and past restructuring moves—factors that raise medium-term risk relative to stable, cash-generative firms. However, an actual bankruptcy within weeks usually requires a hard catalyst (imminent maturity without refinancing, acute cash crunch). Without evidence of such a catalyst, the short-horizon risk remains low.\n\nWhy not higher: No public distress signals (defaults, forbearances, imminent maturities in the next few weeks, vendor actions) have surfaced; filings are typically telegraphed. The short remaining window further suppresses odds.\n\nWhy not lower: The company operates in a volatile segment with recent performance challenges; if a concealed refinancing need or sudden shock emerges, a rapid filing is possible. Small-caps’ liquidity can deteriorate quickly if vendors tighten terms or a quarter severely misses expectations.\n\nWhat would move the forecast up: • Disclosure of substantial doubt about going concern in the Q1 10-Q or subsequent 8-K • News of missed/extended interest or principal payments, covenant breaches, or negotiations with creditors • Reported inability to refinance a near-term maturity • Vendor/lender pullback, liens/attachments, or emergency bridge financing at punitive terms • Large unexpected legal liabilities.\n\nWhat would move it down: • Evidence of adequate liquidity runway (cash and revolver availability) • Successful refinancing or capital raise • Positive cash flow guidance or stronger-than-expected Q1 results • Affirmative statements from management/auditors alleviating going-concern concerns.\n\nOverall, weighting the strong status quo and short horizon against sector/company headwinds, I assign a low but non-zero probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
