  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (from 2025-05-16 until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today Bangladesh is not shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and without further regulatory and commercial steps (e.g., tariff approval, order page activation), it would likely remain unavailable past July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BTRC takes longer than expected to approve Starlink’s tariff plan and any remaining consumer-facing compliance (pricing, taxes, type approval/standards), pushing commercial launch into July or later. Political or industry pushback leads to additional reviews or conditions (e.g., gateway or local partner requirements), delaying the website switch to Available.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BTRC approves Starlink’s tariff plan in late May or June, Starlink activates ordering for Bangladeshi addresses (even if initial shipments are limited), and the availability map toggles at least part of Bangladesh to Available before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Evidence pointing to Yes: (1) Licenses were granted on April 30, 2025, covering service provision and equipment import; (2) Starlink has a locally registered entity; (3) public statements from government and SpaceX have targeted a May 2025 launch; (4) a successful trial occurred April 9; (5) with inter-satellite links, Starlink can operate without waiting for a local gateway. Bangladesh’s leadership has also signaled intent to finalize a commercial deal within three months of late March, which aligns with a before–July 1 window. \nEvidence pointing to No: The tariff plan reportedly still needs regulator approval. In many markets, such last-mile regulatory steps (tariff/pricing approval, consumer terms, tax handling, device approvals) can add weeks or months. Historical lags between licensing and the website showing Available have ranged from under three months to over a year. The U.S. political inquiry into SpaceX’s foreign deals likely doesn’t halt operations, but it adds headline risk that could make officials more procedurally cautious. Local ISP interests or administrative bottlenecks could also slow activation. \nWeighing these: The momentum and government enthusiasm in Bangladesh suggest a relatively fast path. From Apr 30 to Jul 1 is ~62 days, which is tight but feasible if tariff approval is handled in late May or early June. Even partial availability anywhere in the country counts for resolution, increasing the chance of a Yes. However, because the status quo today is non-availability and there is at least one known regulatory step outstanding, I discount from a very high probability. \nWhy not higher: Uncertainty around BTRC’s tariff approval timeline and potential for unforeseen compliance steps could push launch into July. Why not lower: Strong political sponsorship, licenses in hand, the technical ability to launch without a local gateway, and stated May launch ambitions keep the odds above even. \nWhat would move me up: Public confirmation of BTRC tariff approval; Starlink publishing Bangladeshi pricing; order page accepting Bangladeshi addresses; government announcement of a June consumer launch; reports of terminals being imported/stocked. \nWhat would move me down: Reports of tariff approval delays, new conditions (e.g., mandatory local gateway first), import/tax disputes, or official statements pushing commercial availability to July or later.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
