    "review": "Forecaster 2’s case leans heavily on the assumption that the April 5 and May 1 actions will both (a) be captured by GPT and (b) count for this question. The biggest gap is that both appear to predate the question’s launch (today is May 2), so they likely do not qualify under the “start date after launch” clause. F2 also assumes GPT will catalog at least one of these in a way that explicitly meets “10,000+,” which is far from guaranteed given GPT’s selective coverage and occasional vague size descriptors (“thousands”). A 95% estimate seems to underweight both the timing constraint and GPT’s curation/lag risks.\n\nForecaster 3 offers a more balanced view and correctly highlights the dilution risk of multi-city actions and uncertainty around GPT’s size reporting. However, F3 also does not squarely address the “after launch” constraint and puts more weight on average event size than is informative for tail outcomes; protest sizes are heavy-tailed, so averages can be misleading when assessing the chance of at least one 10k+ city. Still, their 65% acknowledges meaningful uncertainty about GPT inclusion and single-location thresholds.\n\nNet: Neither forecaster provided decisive new evidence about GPT’s update cadence, U.S. inclusion practices in 2025, or confirmation of a post–May 2 planned mega-march. Their arguments don’t change my main concern: the binding constraints are (1) timing (only post-launch events count), and (2) GPT’s selective logging and size labeling. That keeps the probability below even odds for me.",
    "rationale": "I’m adjusting slightly downward from my prior to reflect that April 5 and May 1 likely do not qualify due to the “start date after launch” criterion—removing a key path I previously considered (backfilling those events). There remain plausible paths to “Yes”: a large, single-day national march in late May/June (e.g., tied to SCOTUS decisions or a salient policy action) that GPT adds as a distinct U.S. entry with explicit 10,000+ language; or a city-specific mobilization (NYC/DC/LA/Chicago) that clears 10k and is cataloged with sufficient size detail. But risks are material: high protest activity remains fragmented; GPT may either not add new U.S. entries for ongoing movements or may use ambiguous size descriptors; and the two-month window is short.\n\nGiven those constraints, I lower my forecast modestly. I do not go lower because the political environment supports at least one potential large rally, and historically U.S. movements can mobilize 10k+ on short notice.\n\nWhat would move me up: announcement of a major national march before July with credible >10k city-specific expectations; evidence GPT has recently and promptly added U.S. entries with clear 10k+ counts. What would move me down: several weeks without relevant GPT updates; indications GPT is subsuming large 2025 rallies under existing entries with earlier start dates or labeling sizes only as “thousands.”",
