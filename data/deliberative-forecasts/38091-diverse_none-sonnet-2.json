    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 3's identification of event-driven clustering around the Paris Air Show is particularly valuable - I had not considered that June typically features major aerospace gatherings that create diplomatic windows for announcements. This provides a concrete mechanism beyond just extrapolating the recent rate. However, I'm skeptical of Forecaster 2's claim that 'at least eight countries' joined in the first 4.5 months of 2025. The provided background only verifies Bangladesh (April 8) and Norway (May 15) as 2025 signatories, and if eight had truly joined, this would represent an unprecedented acceleration that should have been mentioned in the question background. This may be a factual error that inflates their confidence. Forecaster 3's saturation point is also well-taken - as the pool of willing signatories narrows, the marginal difficulty of recruiting new members increases. Both forecasters landed at 60-65%, slightly above my 55%, suggesting possible consensus that I'm being marginally too conservative.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the most significant new information is the event-driven clustering argument. The Paris Air Show (typically mid-to-late June) is indeed a high-profile venue where aerospace and space policy announcements frequently occur, providing a concrete diplomatic opportunity I had underweighted. This mechanism makes a June signing more plausible than random monthly probability alone would suggest. However, several factors keep me from moving to the 60-65% range: (1) we are already on May 29 with no public signals of an imminent signing, (2) even with the Paris Air Show, there's no guarantee a signing will occur there, (3) Forecaster 2's higher rate estimate appears to rest on unverified claims about eight 2025 signings, and (4) the one-month window remains inherently restrictive for diplomatic agreements regardless of events. The event-driven mechanism is genuine new information worth incorporating, but it doesn't overcome the fundamental timing uncertainty. I'm updating moderately upward from 55% to 58% to account for the Paris Air Show opportunity while maintaining appropriate skepticism about diplomatic timing precision.",
