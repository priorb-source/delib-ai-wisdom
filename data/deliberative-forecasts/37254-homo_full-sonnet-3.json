    "review": "Both forecasters identified a critical dimension I underweighted: the US policy shift makes accusations less likely even if Russian military action occurred. The question requires TWO conditions - Russia must invade AND the US must publicly accuse them. The evidence of US voting WITH Russia and North Korea against UN resolutions demanding withdrawal, while proposing alternatives without mentioning Russian aggression, is a strong signal about current administration policy. This creates a double constraint: not only must Russia invade (already unlikely given military commitment, short timeframe, lack of intelligence corroboration), but the US must also be willing to publicly accuse them despite demonstrating reluctance to use confrontational language. Forecaster 3 particularly emphasized that even limited Russian military action might not be characterized as 'invasion' by this administration. This is persuasive reasoning I should have weighted more heavily.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters correctly identified that I insufficiently weighted the US policy dimension. The resolution criteria requires a US public accusation of invasion, not merely Russian military action. The described US diplomatic behavior - voting against Ukrainian withdrawal resolutions, aligning with Russia/North Korea, avoiding mention of Russian aggression - suggests a fundamental policy shift away from publicly condemning Russian actions. This creates two necessary but uncertain conditions rather than one. The core factors remain: (1) extremely short 2-month timeframe with zero preparation indicators from credible Western intelligence, (2) Russia's heavy military commitment in Ukraine limiting capacity for new operations, (3) NATO Article 5 implications for Baltic/Poland scenarios, and (4) crucially, US policy appearing designed to avoid confrontational accusations. The forecast should be marginally lower to reflect the compounding probabilities of both Russian action AND US willingness to publicly accuse. I'm updating from 5% to 4% to align with the other forecasters' more thorough treatment of the US policy constraint.",
