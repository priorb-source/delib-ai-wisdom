    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification requirements is enacted by the deadline. Ohio's voter registration laws remain as they were on May 5, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio General Assembly dedicates the majority of its legislative calendar in May and June to negotiating and passing the state's biennial budget, which has a constitutional deadline of June 30. The citizenship verification bill does not gain sufficient priority to be fast-tracked, and it fails to pass both the House and Senate by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on their supermajorities, Republican leadership in both the House and Senate prioritize the bill as a key policy win on election integrity. They successfully navigate it through the necessary committees and floor votes in both chambers in an expedited fashion during June, and an identical version of the bill is passed by both houses before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% is primarily based on the significant legislative hurdles the bill faces in a very short timeframe, despite the favorable political environment for its passage. The dominant factor weighing against enactment is the legislative calendar. With less than two months until the July 1, 2025 deadline, the Ohio General Assembly's primary focus will be the passage of the state's biennial budget by its June 30 deadline. This is a complex and time-consuming process that typically consumes the vast majority of legislative resources and political capital in the first half of an odd-numbered year. Passing a separate, controversial piece of legislation like a new citizenship verification requirement concurrently is a difficult task. The status quo is a powerful force in forecasting, and the default outcome is that the legislature focuses only on what it must pass (the budget), leaving other bills for later in the session. A similar bill (SB 117) failed to pass during the previous General Assembly, indicating that while there is support, it has not historically been a top-tier priority that must be passed at all costs. The information provided by my research assistant was minimal, indicating no special circumstances are currently elevating the bill's importance. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 25% because Ohio's government is controlled by a Republican trifecta with supermajorities in both legislative chambers. The issue of 'election integrity' is highly salient with the Republican base, providing strong motivation to pass such a bill. If legislative leadership makes this a priority, they have the votes and procedural power to push it through quickly, even alongside budget negotiations. The enactment of a strict photo ID law in the previous session demonstrates this legislature's willingness and ability to pass such laws. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 25% due to the aforementioned dominance of the state budget as a legislative priority and the very tight timeline. Without a clear signal from legislative leaders that this bill is a 'must-pass' item before the summer recess, legislative inertia makes enactment before July 1 unlikely. \n\nI would increase my forecast if the bill quickly passes out of committee in one chamber or if House and Senate leadership publicly state their intent to pass it before the end of June. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the bill remains stalled in committee by early June, or if legislative debate becomes overwhelmingly focused on contentious budget items, signaling a lack of bandwidth for other issues.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
