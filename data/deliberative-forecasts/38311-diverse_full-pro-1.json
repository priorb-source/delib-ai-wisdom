    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the substantial evidence favoring a 'Yes' outcome: the official White House confirmation, extensive logistical and security preparations, attendance of U.S. principals at preparatory meetings, and the strong historical precedent of presidential attendance. The divergence in our forecasts stems from how we weigh the downside risks.\n\nMy initial forecast was likely too high because it did not sufficiently account for Donald Trump's specific track record. Forecasters 2 and 3 correctly emphasized his past unpredictability. Forecaster 3's contribution was particularly compelling by providing specific, well-reasoned examples: the cancellation of his trips to the 2018 Summit of the Americas (due to the Syria crisis) and the 2019 Davos forum (due to a government shutdown). This evidence demonstrates a clear precedent for Trump canceling major international travel in response to significant—but not necessarily existential—domestic or foreign policy crises. This is a crucial piece of evidence I had previously underweighted. Forecaster 3 also compellingly linked the reported disagreements over the joint statement to a potential, if unlikely, 'tactical' cancellation. These arguments are convincing and necessitate a revision of my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 98% to 93%. The core positive evidence remains unchanged and is very strong. However, the deliberation has convinced me that my initial 2% probability for non-attendance was too low.\n\nThe historical examples provided by Forecaster 3 show that President Trump has a lower threshold for canceling major foreign travel than the historical base rate of U.S. presidents would suggest. While my initial forecast allowed for a major 'force majeure' type event, the evidence of past cancellations for the Summit of the Americas and Davos expands the range of plausible cancellation triggers to include significant political or security crises that might not cause other presidents to cancel. \n\nTherefore, I am increasing the probability of a 'No' outcome from 2% to 7% to better reflect this specific risk profile. This 7% accounts for a non-trivial possibility of a significant domestic or international crisis arising in the next 12 days, as well as smaller chances of a cancellation for tactical reasons, a health issue, or major logistical disruption. I am not lowering my forecast to 90% because, as of today, there are no active, brewing crises on the scale of those that prompted previous cancellations, and the White House confirmation is both recent and firm. My revised 93% forecast strikes a more accurate balance between the overwhelming positive evidence and Trump's demonstrated, higher-than-average propensity to cancel.",
