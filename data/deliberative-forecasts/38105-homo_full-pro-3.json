    "review": "The other two forecasters and I agree on the fundamental tension: a short, one-month timeline and deep-seated political obstacles versus significant momentum from active, high-level negotiations and strong external pressure. Our initial assessments differ primarily in the weight we assign to these opposing forces. My forecast of 25% was more heavily anchored in the historical precedent of Lebanon's political paralysis on the key issue of bank restructuring. The other forecasters, both at 35%, made a convincing collective case that I was underweighting the unique factors of the current situation. They highlighted that this is a 'more advanced stage' of negotiations with a specific draft agreement on the table, and that external pressure is at a 'peak,' particularly with the EU explicitly tying 500 million euros in aid to an IMF deal. I find this framing persuasive. This isn't just another round of talks; the stakes and incentives are more immediate and concrete than in the past, which could plausibly force a political breakthrough that has previously been impossible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. I was likely too anchored on the historical base rate of political failure in Lebanon without sufficiently appreciating the heightened and more immediate nature of the current incentives. The other forecasters convincingly argued that the combination of a formal IMF mission in Beirut negotiating a specific draft agreement and the explicit EU aid conditionality represents a qualitative shift in pressure on Lebanese policymakers. While the core obstacle—passing a politically explosive bank-restructuring law—remains formidable and the one-month timeline is exceptionally tight, the cost of failure has arguably never been higher or more immediate. This acute pressure creates a more plausible, albeit still narrow, path to a rapid compromise than I had initially assessed. I am therefore revising my forecast from 25% to 35%, aligning with the other experts. This new forecast still reflects that a 'No' outcome is the most likely scenario, but it gives more credit to the power of the current confluence of pressures to force a last-minute deal against the odds.",
