  "forecast": {
    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior reasoning: the May 10 DGMO ceasefire, planned end‑May withdrawals, and India’s ongoing diplomatic campaign point to de‑escalation through June, with residual tail risk if a major provocation occurs. Forecaster 2’s checklist of indicators (NOTAMs, force movements, CCS meetings, failure of withdrawals) and emphasis that most routine retaliation stays on the LoC/PoK is persuasive and aligned with my base case. Forecaster 3’s higher estimate leans on the length of the June window and spoiler risks; that’s a valid point but, in my view, still constrained by the political and diplomatic incentives to avoid striking Pakistan proper absent a new mass‑casualty trigger. Neither analysis introduced materially new facts beyond the RA; the arguments were already incorporated into my framing.",
    "rationale": "I’m keeping my forecast unchanged. The modal path remains sustained de‑escalation: verified pullbacks by end‑May would further depress the June hazard rate, India’s diplomatic push runs into early June, and New Delhi can signal resolve via LoC/AJK actions without entering Pakistan’s provinces. While delegated authority for kinetic responses keeps a non‑trivial tail live—especially if there’s a mass‑casualty terror attack or a lethal, attributable cross‑border incident—the threshold for a strike in Sindh/Balochistan/Punjab/KP is still high. I see no new indicators suggesting imminent preparations for such an action. I would move up quickly on credible reports of a major June provocation tied to Pakistan‑based groups plus observable Indian military preparations; conversely, confirmed withdrawals and a quiet first half of June would push me lower.",
