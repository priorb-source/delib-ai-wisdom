  "information": "Public polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days until the April 27, 2025 election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "SPÖ wins the most seats with a comfortable margin",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another party, most likely the FPÖ, overtakes SPÖ through either a massive polling error (15+ percentage points), an unprecedented late campaign surge, or differential turnout effects that dramatically favor the FPÖ while suppressing SPÖ support",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SPÖ maintains its polling advantage and converts its 38-40% vote share into a plurality of seats in the Vienna state parliament, outperforming the FPÖ's 21-24% as indicated by current polling",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. My research assistant reports that multiple reliable polls from ElectsWorld and ORF consistently show SPÖ with 38-40% support compared to FPÖ's 21-24%, representing a 16-19 percentage point lead. With only 6 days remaining until the election, there is minimal time for dramatic shifts in voter preferences. Historical precedent suggests polling errors of this magnitude are rare, and even a substantial error of 8-10 points would still leave SPÖ ahead. The status quo principle strongly applies here - absent new information suggesting a dramatic change, the polling consensus should be weighted heavily. I'm not forecasting higher (closer to 99%) because polling errors do occur, late campaign developments can matter, and seat allocation mechanics could theoretically produce unexpected results. I'm not forecasting lower because the lead is too substantial and consistent across multiple polls for there to be significant doubt. For me to update higher, I would need final polls showing an expanding lead or confirmation from early voting data. For me to update lower, new polls would need to show significant tightening (SPÖ lead under 10 points) or evidence of major political developments favoring opposition parties in the final week.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
