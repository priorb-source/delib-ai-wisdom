    "review": "Both forecasters center on the short runway and the absence of clear pre-launch signals; I agree that’s the dominant evidence. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the lack of leaks, staff hires, paperwork, or scheduled events is compelling for a 26-day horizon, though I’ll note Florida doesn’t require a formal exploratory-committee step, so that specific absence is less determinative than leaks/staffing/media holds. Forecaster 3 adds the (plausible) constraint of a Trump-endorsed rival making the path harder, which further reduces any incentive for a rush announcement before July 1. Even if that endorsement detail were wrong or premature, the broader point stands: there’s no strong strategic forcing mechanism to announce in June 2025. Overall, their arguments reinforce my prior view; if anything, they marginally push downward, but not by much given the possibility of a quick, low-friction announcement via social media or press release.",
    "rationale": "We have 26 days left, Suarez is publicly “weighing” a bid, but there are no visible signs of an imminent rollout (no event leaks, venue holds, statewide tour plans, or senior staff hires surfacing). The potential extension of Miami’s election schedule reduces any urgency to jump now. The presence of a strong rival with high-profile backing (as noted by Forecaster 3) further weakens the case for a quick June launch. Against that, it remains feasible to announce with minimal logistics. On balance, the status quo and short timeline dominate. I keep my forecast where it was: low, but not negligible. I would move up quickly on credible reporting of a scheduled announcement, creation/activation of a statewide committee clearly branded for a gubernatorial run, key staff hires, or media advisories. I would move down on reporting that Suarez plans to decide later in 2025 or is leaning against running.",
