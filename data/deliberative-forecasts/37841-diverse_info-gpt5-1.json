    "review": "Forecaster 2 highlights policing/Counter Terrorism and insurer risk as dominant drivers to a No. That’s a useful reminder that this is beyond ordinary PR controversy, but I think they over-weight an insurer veto and underweight the strong status quo (still on lineup) and evidence of UK gigs going ahead post-charge. Forecaster 3 adds concrete new details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: Section 13 charge and a June 18 court date, just a week before Glastonbury. They also correctly emphasize the resolution criterion (partial lineup still counts) and Glastonbury’s tolerance for controversy. I find F3’s framing broadly persuasive; the near-term court date does add a specific pivot point where restrictive bail could arrive and pressure could spike. Net: F2 nudges me slightly down on institutional/licensing risk, F3 largely supports my initial leaning-Yes but flags the June 18 inflection point as a real downside.",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors Yes: Kneecap remains on the official West Holts lineup, and Glastonbury typically resists political pressure and defends booked acts. Empirically, despite the charge becoming public, the band performed a surprise London gig on May 22 and is proceeding with UK festival dates like Wide Awake—evidence there is no immediate legal bar to performing. Offsetting this, the Section 13 charge and a June 18 court appearance create a late, high-uncertainty checkpoint. While bail conditions in such cases are more likely to target specific conduct (e.g., symbols/statements) rather than a blanket performance ban, tighter conditions or a public-order assessment by police/licensing close to the event could still push Glastonbury to drop them. Several cancellations (Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, Hurricane/Southside) show that some promoters are risk-averse; however, Glastonbury is atypically resilient to this kind of pressure, and the resolution criterion means even a two-member set would resolve Yes. Balancing: strong status quo and Glastonbury’s ethos vs. the legal/policing pivot on June 18 and ongoing political scrutiny. I trim slightly from 62% to 60% to reflect the specific risk that the court date—so close to the festival—could trigger new constraints or intensify pressure.",
