  "information": "Multiple polls conducted in late April 2025 indicated a consistent lead for the Liberal Party in national popular vote intentions. A poll by UrduPoint (April 21) showed Liberals at 43.3% and Conservatives at 38.4%. The Globe and Mail (April 21) reported Liberals at 43% and Conservatives at 37%. An Infobae/Nanos poll (April 20) placed Liberals at 44.7% and Conservatives at 37.3%. A Liaison Strategies poll (April 17-19) found Liberals at 43% and Conservatives at 38%. The reported gap in these polls ranged from 4.9 to 7.4 percentage points.\n\nPolling data from key regions indicates specific strengths for each party. In Quebec, the Liberal Party holds a lead with 40% support, compared to 25% for the Conservatives. The Liberals also maintain a lead in Ontario. In contrast, the Conservatives lead in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In British Columbia, the race is reported to be tied, with both parties at 42% support.\n\nAnalysis of voter demographics and commitment levels reveals differing patterns. Among declared voters, 76% of Conservative supporters describe themselves as \"very committed\" to their choice, compared to 63% for Liberal supporters. The Conservative Party holds a narrow lead among voters under the age of 35, with 39% support versus 38% for the Liberals. Advanced voting has seen high participation, with over 2 million ballots cast on the first day. No further major debates or campaign-wide events are scheduled before the election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election appears imminent based on the context that advance voting has begun with over 2 million ballots cast on the first day. The outcome will likely be known within a few days, probably by April 25-28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Liberals win the popular vote. All recent polls from April 17-21 consistently show the Liberal Party leading the Conservatives by 5-7 percentage points (Liberals: 43-44.7%, Conservatives: 37-38.4%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberals maintain their consistent polling lead through election day. The polls prove accurate, and the Liberals win the popular vote by approximately 5-6 percentage points, with the Conservatives finishing second.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives close the gap through superior turnout driven by their higher voter commitment levels (76% vs 63% 'very committed'). Late-deciding voters break heavily Conservative, or the polls systematically underestimate Conservative support by 5-7 points, allowing them to narrowly win the popular vote.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Liberal popular vote victory. Multiple independent polls from four different sources (UrduPoint, Globe and Mail, Infobae/Nanos, Liaison Strategies) conducted April 17-21 all show a consistent 5-7 point Liberal lead. This consistency across pollsters reduces the likelihood of systematic polling error. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) Conservative voters show significantly higher commitment (76% vs 63% 'very committed'), which could translate to superior turnout; (2) high advance voting suggests an engaged electorate but doesn't clearly favor either party; (3) Conservatives lead among under-35 voters and dominate Western provinces, though Liberals lead in population-dense Ontario and Quebec. For Conservatives to win, they would need either a systematic polling error of 5-7 points or a massive differential turnout advantage - both possible but unlikely. Canadian polling has generally been reliable, and with only days remaining, dramatic shifts are uncommon. The probability is not lower because voter commitment gaps and turnout effects are real factors that could narrow or overcome the polling gap. The probability is not higher because the consistent polling lead is substantial and comes from multiple independent sources.",
