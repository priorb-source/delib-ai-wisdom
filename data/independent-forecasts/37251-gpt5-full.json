  "information": "According to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million. The deal was expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025 and would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam. If completed, Vietnam would become the 10th foreign country to acquire the K9 system.\n\nActions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace. In November 2024, Vietnamese troops also participated in a training program in South Korea for using the K9 howitzer. The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.\n\nThe potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Hanwha Aerospace, the manufacturer of the K9, has been actively securing defense contracts globally, with significant sales to Poland, Australia, and Egypt. The company reported a substantial increase in its first-quarter 2025 sales, driven by exports of the K9, and noted expectations for more orders in the second half of the year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks slip past July due to Vietnamese budgeting/approvals, sensitivity about signaling to China, or haggling over price, offsets, ammo/support packages, or financing; or a quiet/undisclosed signing occurs without any government announcement (which would not satisfy the question’s criterion).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seoul and Hanoi conclude the contract and publicly announce it (e.g., via DAPA/MND press releases or during a high-level visit) for ~20 K9 self-propelled howitzers (and likely support), explicitly stating an export of 2+ units to Vietnam before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Evidence in favor: Multiple South Korean industry/government sources (Jan 2025) described the deal as in final stages for ~20 K9s worth about $300M, with expectation of Q1 2025 finalization. Vietnamese training on K9s in Nov 2024 and the 2022 upgrade to a comprehensive strategic partnership support seriousness. Hanwha’s global momentum on K9 exports and Vietnam’s diversification away from Russia also push toward completion. If signed, Korea typically publicizes such milestones, satisfying the announcement criterion. Evidence against and timing risk: Q1 passed without an announcement, implying slippage. Vietnam’s first-ever purchase of Korean arms is politically sensitive; Hanoi may avoid a public announcement to limit friction with China or defer timing. Vietnamese procurement can be slow; package details (ammo, K10 resupply vehicles, training, maintenance, financing, ToT/offsets) can delay signatures. Even if signed soon, buyer-imposed confidentiality could prevent a qualifying government announcement by July 1. Status quo weighting: With only ~2 months left and a missed Q1 target, the default is no announcement by July 1 absent a clear trigger (e.g., a scheduled high-level visit or DAPA notice), so baseline leans No. Why not higher: The missed Q1 window and high political/administrative sensitivity reduce the near-term odds; the requirement for an explicit government announcement is a further hurdle. Why not lower: The reporting of final-stage talks, prior training, and strategic alignment suggest the deal is real and close; two months is enough time if final approvals are already in motion. What would move me up: Credible reports of Vietnamese cabinet/Politburo approval; scheduling of a high-level SK–VN defense visit; DAPA or Hanwha guidance pointing to imminent signing; leaked signing date; Vietnamese state media previews. What would move me down: Reports of delay to H2 2025 or later, budget issues, alternate artillery selection, Chinese diplomatic pushback causing deferral, or statements implying any agreement will remain undisclosed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
