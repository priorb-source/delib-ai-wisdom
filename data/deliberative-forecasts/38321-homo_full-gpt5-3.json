    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my view: public White House confirmation, allied echoes, short lead time, strong incentives and precedent all point to attendance. Useful additions I hadn’t explicitly emphasized: (1) the specific risk that Trump could show up in-country but avoid a leaders’ session where he’s co-present with other heads of state, which could technically fail the resolution; (2) a small discount for inconsistencies in the research assistant’s brief (e.g., SecGen identity, G7 venue), which slightly weakens the evidentiary weight of that report even if the core claim seems sound. I agree with their identified downside risks (health, crisis, security, Trump’s unpredictability) and with their “what would move me up/down” lists. Overall, their reasoning is convincing and nudges me marginally downward due to the RA sloppiness and the edge-case attendance-definition risk.",
    "rationale": "We are ~3 weeks out with an on-record White House confirmation and allied confirmations, and the diplomatic/agenda incentives for Trump to attend are strong. Historically, U.S. presidents attend NATO summits, and Trump did so in his prior term. Logistics for a presidential trip would already be well underway. The residual risk set includes: acute domestic or international crises; health/medical issues for a 79-year-old; security or travel disruptions; Trump’s idiosyncratic schedule changes; and a small, technical risk that he limits his presence to avoid co-presence with other leaders (which could fail the resolution as written). The research assistant’s minor factual slips slightly reduce my confidence in that single-source summary but don’t overturn the central claim of a White House confirmation. Netting these, I trim slightly from my prior 92% to reflect the edge-case definitional risk and small evidentiary discount, while keeping the forecast firmly in the low 90s given the strong signals and short horizon.",
