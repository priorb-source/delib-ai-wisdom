    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical evidence I completely missed: Forecaster 2 provides specific data showing January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March ranked first or tied for first, April was second warmest, and Q1 2025 was the second warmest on record. This fundamentally changes the analysis. If 2025 has already set two monthly records and nearly a third in just four months, this is an exceptionally hot year, making it much more likely May also ranked first. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that 2025 is forecast to be in the top 3-5 hottest years. Both forecasters appropriately weighted the sustained exceptional warmth against the ENSO transition. My original analysis was far too conservative - I overweighted base rates and mixed regional signals while lacking the crucial context of 2025's actual performance in other months. The regional anecdotes I focused on (like Ahmedabad's cooling) are far less informative than the global monthly rankings showing 2025's exceptional warmth. Both forecasters' reasoning around 48-50% is much more defensible given this evidence.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially updating my forecast upward. The evidence of 2025's exceptional performance across multiple months (2 records, 1 near-record in just 4 months) is far stronger than I initially appreciated. When a year sets this many monthly records in sequence, the probability that adjacent months also rank first increases significantly. My original 30% forecast wrongly treated May as an isolated event rather than part of a broader pattern of exceptional 2025 warmth. However, I'm not going quite as high as 50% because: (1) April's second-place finish (not first) suggests some moderation occurring, (2) the ENSO transition from El Niño to neutral typically reduces warming potential by 0.1-0.2°C, and (3) the margin for records is tight - May needs to exceed approximately +0.95°C anomaly. The mixed regional signals (Ahmedabad cooling vs European heat) also suggest some geographic variability. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence strongly supports May 2025 being exceptionally warm. I'm settling at 47%, acknowledging the sustained exceptional warmth of 2025 while respecting the uncertainty from ENSO transition and the tight margins involved in breaking records.",
