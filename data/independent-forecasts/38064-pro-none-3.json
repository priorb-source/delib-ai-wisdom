    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The outcome will be known on June 12, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The meeting will take place as scheduled. Annual shareholder meetings for publicly traded companies are routine, legally mandated events that are almost always held on their announced date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A massive surge of interest from retail investors, similar to the event in 2024, overwhelms the meeting's web servers. Despite preparations, the technical infrastructure fails, forcing the company to halt and postpone the meeting after it has already begun.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having learned from the server crash in 2024, Gamestop invests in a highly robust hosting platform capable of handling extreme traffic. The annual meeting proceeds and concludes on June 12, 2025, without any significant technical disruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong base rate that corporate annual meetings occur as scheduled. These are legally required and meticulously planned events. However, this is not a standard case. The 2024 Gamestop meeting provides a specific and highly relevant counterpoint, demonstrating a tangible risk of failure due to overwhelming server demand from retail investors. This precedent is the primary reason the probability is not higher than 95%. I believe the company is strongly incentivized to avoid a repeat of that public failure. They have had a full year to contract with a more capable vendor and conduct extensive load testing. The reputational and shareholder relations cost of a second consecutive failure would be immense. Therefore, it is highly likely that sufficient resources have been allocated to ensure the meeting proceeds smoothly. My forecast is not lower because that would underestimate the ability and motivation of a large corporation to solve a known technical problem for a critical, recurring event. A failure probability of more than 15-20% seems too high given the circumstances. I would increase my forecast if Gamestop or its vendor released a statement detailing their technical preparations and successful stress tests. I would decrease my forecast if there were early reports of technical glitches with the meeting portal or if a new, unprecedented surge in social media activity suggested traffic might exceed even the upgraded capacity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
