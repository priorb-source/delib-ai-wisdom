  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.\n\nThe weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.\n\nAs of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (roughly 42 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "On July 1, flightsfrom.com/SPN lists only Guam (GUM), Seoul-Incheon (ICN), Busan (PUS), and either no Tokyo-Narita (NRT) service or NRT plus no additional city. With ≤4 destinations, the outcome is No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, flightsfrom.com/SPN shows at least five non-stop destinations, e.g., GUM, ICN, PUS, NRT, and one new/additional route such as Hong Kong (HKG) or a Korean secondary city (e.g., Daegu TAE, Muan MWX, Cheongju CJJ), or a revived Japanese city (e.g., Osaka KIX or Nagoya NGO), with schedules loaded in GDS so they appear on flightsfrom.",
    "rationale": "Baseline today (mid-May 2025) is 3–4 destinations: GUM (United), ICN (Jeju Air, T’way, Jin Air), PUS (Jeju Air), and an intermittently listed NRT (United). The question requires strictly more than 4, i.e., ≥5, as shown on flightsfrom.com on/after July 1. Airline schedules for early July are largely set; adding a brand-new route inside a ~6-week window is uncommon unless already announced and filed. The research assistant notes: heavy reliance on the Korean market (marketing push, events), weak Japanese yen dampening Japan outbound, some promotional activity for NRT by United, and interest from Hong Kong travelers with Hong Kong Airlines listing Saipan as a destination. These are supportive but not strong evidence of a new scheduled city starting by July 1. The most plausible path to Yes is: NRT is operating in early July (making 4), plus one more scheduled route appears (e.g., a Korean secondary-city seasonal service or HKG). However, as of mid-May, flight trackers generally show only 3–4 destinations; if a summer seasonal Korean secondary-city service was coming, it would likely already be visible in schedules. There’s also downside risk that NRT is not operating on July 1 or PUS is seasonal and not loaded for that date, keeping the count at 3. Why not higher: short lead time, Japan headwinds, limited recent evidence of additional routes loaded in GDS, and Saipan’s constrained demand recovering mainly via Korea. Why not lower: summer peak demand could support a seasonal Korean secondary-city service; United’s NRT promotion suggests some commitment; Hong Kong interest could translate into limited service; only one incremental route beyond the current set is needed if NRT is active. What would move me up: verified schedule filings (GDS/airline announcements) for any added city (e.g., HKG, TAE/MWX/CJJ, KIX/NGO) operating on/around July 1, or confirmation that NRT and PUS are both operating then. What would move me down: evidence that NRT is suspended in early July, that PUS pauses, or that flightsfrom is showing only GUM and ICN around July 1.",
