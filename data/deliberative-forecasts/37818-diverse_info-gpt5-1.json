    "review": "Both forecasters focus on the crucial points: the subset is pilot reports (not general sightings), low monthly counts make randomness and ties common, and ties resolve to No. Forecaster 2 adds a potentially relevant March 28, 2025 Florida military incident that could raise awareness/reporting into June; I hadn’t incorporated that specific event. Forecaster 3 offers quantitative priors (8–12 pilot reports/month nationally) and claims Florida is top-2 for pilot reports with California often leading—useful framing, though I’d prefer a cited source for the monthly average and the top-2 claim. I find their emphasis on tie risk and competition from CA/TX/AZ persuasive. The March incident likely offers only a modest, decaying uplift by June. Overall, their arguments nudge me slightly upward from my prior but not to the mid-to-high 20s given persistent tie risk and multiple strong competitor states.",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on: (1) small national monthly totals for NUFORC pilot reports; (2) multiple high-activity competitor states (CA, TX, AZ, NV) with significant military and commercial aviation; (3) high tie probability; and (4) Florida’s credible mechanisms to generate clusters (dense airspace, military ranges, Gulf/Atlantic routes, Space Coast activity). The new considerations from peers are: (a) a notable late-March Florida military incident that could modestly increase pilot vigilance/reporting into June; (b) a plausible monthly pilot-report baseline (~8–12) reinforcing that a single incident can swing the month but also increases tie likelihood. Given these, Florida’s chance of uniquely leading in June looks a bit higher than my initial 18%, but competition and tie risk remain substantial. I update to 22%, reflecting Florida as a top contender but not the favorite, and discounting sustained effects from the March incident by June. I would move higher with early June NUFORC entries showing multiple pilot reports in Florida or credible reports of a multi-crew/ATC event over Florida during June; I would move lower if early postings cluster in CA/TX/AZ or if several states each log one report (raising tie risk).",
