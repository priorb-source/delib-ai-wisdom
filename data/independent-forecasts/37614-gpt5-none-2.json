    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall question fails or lacks a majority to remove, so Metz remains on the town council.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: For local recalls that make the ballot, removal often succeeds roughly half the time or slightly more. In small municipalities, organized opposition can dominate low-turnout special elections, pushing outcomes toward removal.\n- Salience/valence: The underlying controversy—being accused of shooting a teen in the face—creates strong negative valence likely to mobilize recall supporters and swing undecideds toward removal.\n- Countervailing factors: Incumbency and the status quo generally help retention, and in very small electorates a cohesive support network can be decisive. If criminal charges are absent or the facts are more exculpatory than headlines suggest, that could blunt the recall case. \n- Net: With limited information beyond the article framing, I weight the negative salience and recall base rates slightly more than status quo inertia. That places the probability of retention below 50% but not by a wide margin.\n- Why not higher: The severity of the allegation, media attention, and small-town recall dynamics increase removal risk. \n- Why not lower: Status quo/incumbency effects, potential absence of charges or exonerating context, and the volatility of very small electorates keep a path to retention plausible.\n- What would move me up (toward retention): Credible reporting that no charges were filed (and clear exculpatory details), visible endorsements from respected local figures, signs of weak recall organization or low anti-Metz turnout.\n- What would move me down (toward removal): Announcement of criminal charges or damning new evidence, strong grassroots mobilization for the recall, or indications of high turnout driven by opposition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mountain View, Colorado town councilor Brent Metz win his recall election on May 20, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Town councilor accused of shooting teen in face addresses incident during recall election](https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/mountain-view-council-member-accused-of-shooting-teen-addresses-incident/73-5800d282-842f-4fca-a358-ddcdca710eab)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Brent Metz retains his seat as Mountain View, Colorado town councilor following the recall election currently scheduled for May 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
