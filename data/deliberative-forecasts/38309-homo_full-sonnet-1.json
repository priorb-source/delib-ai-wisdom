    "review": "All three analyses reach similar conclusions with forecasts ranging from 73-82%, suggesting broad agreement that Jones is the strong favorite but with some uncertainty remaining. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the $1.4M cash on hand for closing efforts is particularly compelling - this is a concrete resource advantage in the critical final two weeks when advertising and voter contact matter most. The point about mobilization networks from high-profile endorsements is also well-taken; McAuliffe, Northam, and Scott can activate volunteer and donor networks effectively. Forecaster 3's caution about the absence of polling data creating uncertainty is valid and aligns with my initial thinking. However, I may have weighted primary volatility too heavily in my initial forecast. With only 14 days remaining in a two-person race, the fundamentals (money, endorsements, experience) are quite predictive and less likely to be overcome. The structural advantages Jones holds are observable and quantifiable, while the scenarios favoring Taylor are more speculative. That said, the complete absence of polling data does warrant maintaining some uncertainty rather than moving to the high 80s.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial forecast of 73% was slightly too cautious given the strength of the observable evidence. Forecaster 2's argument about cash on hand for final operations and the value of endorsement networks is persuasive. With 14 days left, Jones's 2-to-1 fundraising advantage, multiple gubernatorial endorsements, and prior statewide campaign infrastructure represent concrete advantages that are difficult to overcome. Primary turnout patterns and the two-person nature of the race also favor the candidate with superior resources and organization. However, I'm not moving all the way to 82% because the absence of polling data remains a meaningful gap in our information. If we had polls showing Jones with a comfortable double-digit lead, I would be more confident. The possibility that Taylor's prosecutorial credentials or ground game could outperform expectations, while speculative, cannot be entirely dismissed. Balancing the strong structural indicators with the lack of direct voter preference data, I'm updating upward but maintaining appropriate caution.",
