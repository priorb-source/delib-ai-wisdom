    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical interpretation issue I completely missed: if Laurent Gbagbo was already removed from the electoral list in October 2024 (as the BBC article may indicate), then he 'has been removed' before July 1, 2025, making the question resolve YES unless that removal is reversed. This is fundamentally different from my initial interpretation, which focused on new disqualifications occurring between now and July 1. Forecaster 2's specific claim about Gbagbo's October 2024 removal due to a 2018 conviction is compelling and aligns with the BBC background article mentioning a main opposition leader being removed. However, Forecaster 3 directly contradicts this, stating 'there is no confirmed disqualification of the listed candidates' as of today. This creates uncertainty about whether Gbagbo has actually been removed or if that removal is legally finalized. Forecaster 3's more cautious approach acknowledges the restrictive environment but questions whether formal exclusions have occurred. The tension between these two views hinges on: (1) whether Gbagbo was definitively removed in October 2024, and (2) whether such a past removal counts for this question's resolution. The present perfect tense 'has been removed' in the resolution criteria strongly suggests we're checking the state as of July 1, not just prospective events, which supports Forecaster 2's interpretation.",
    "rationale": "I need to significantly update my forecast based on Forecaster 2's interpretation. If Laurent Gbagbo was removed from the electoral list in October 2024, then the question would resolve YES unless that decision is reversed before July 1 - and such a reversal seems highly unlikely given Ivorian political dynamics and the short 32-day timeframe remaining. The BBC article mentioning a main opposition leader being removed likely refers to Gbagbo himself, reinforcing this interpretation. However, Forecaster 3's claim of no confirmed disqualifications introduces some doubt. My updated reasoning: Even with uncertainty about Gbagbo's current status, the probability must be substantially higher than my initial 45%. If there's a 70% chance Gbagbo was already removed (and only ~10% chance that gets reversed), that alone gives ~63% probability. Combined with the possibility of new disqualifications of other vulnerable candidates in the remaining month, the total probability should be in the 70-85% range. I'm settling on 78% as a balance between Forecaster 2's well-reasoned 95% and the uncertainty introduced by conflicting information about current disqualification status.",
