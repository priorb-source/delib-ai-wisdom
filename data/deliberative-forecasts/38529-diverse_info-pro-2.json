    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful, particularly the introduction of new, specific data. Forecaster 2 provided an excellent qualitative analysis of the risks Andrew Cuomo faces under Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) due to his polarizing nature, which is a crucial structural point. However, Forecaster 3 introduced hard data that directly addressed these concerns: specific polling numbers showing a significant, albeit narrowing, 16-point lead for Cuomo, and a Marist RCV simulation that projects him winning in the final round. This data is highly persuasive and was not part of my initial analysis. I believe Forecaster 3's 77% forecast is slightly too high as it seems to under-weigh the significant momentum Zohran Mamdani has, evidenced by him cutting Cuomo's lead in half. Conversely, Forecaster 2's 56% feels too low now, given the concrete polling lead and favorable RCV simulation.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 60% to 68%. The primary driver for this update is the new, specific data provided by Forecaster 3, which fundamentally strengthens the case for a Cuomo victory. I was previously operating on the general knowledge of a narrowing lead, but having concrete numbers—a 16-point lead in a late May Emerson poll—and, most importantly, a Marist ranked-choice voting (RCV) simulation projecting a Cuomo win, provides a much firmer basis for my forecast. The RCV simulation directly mitigates the primary structural risk that I and Forecaster 2 identified: that Cuomo's high negative ratings would cause him to be eliminated on second- and third-choice vote transfers. While this risk is not eliminated, the simulation provides strong evidence he can overcome it. I am not raising my forecast higher because the core risk identified by all three forecasters remains: Mamdani has substantial momentum, having cut Cuomo's large lead in half. This negative trendline for the frontrunner is a major indicator of volatility and prevents a higher degree of certainty. My updated 68% forecast reflects a balance between Cuomo's strong current standing in polls and simulations against the significant risk posed by his opponent's recent surge.",
