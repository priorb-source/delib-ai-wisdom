    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have arrived at the same 45% probability based on nearly identical reasoning. The core of all our analyses rests on the principle of mean reversion for a volatile economic indicator following a significant one-month surge (+7.6%). Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 reinforced my initial view by specifically articulating the March jump as a potential 'catch-up' or 'fulfillment of delayed orders,' which are clear mechanisms for a one-off spike rather than the start of a sustained trend. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it aligns perfectly with the statistical behavior of such data series. No new evidence or fundamentally different arguments were presented that would challenge this core logic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other two forecasters, I find their reasoning strongly corroborates my own. The consensus view is that the primary factor dictating the forecast is the high likelihood of mean reversion following the unusually strong 7.6% month-over-month increase in March 2025. This large jump sets a high baseline, making a consecutive increase in April statistically less likely. The arguments from the other forecasters that this could represent a temporary 'catch-up' or a fulfillment of backlogged orders, rather than a new growth trend, reinforce my initial assessment. Since no new data or compelling counterarguments have been introduced, the balance of probabilities remains unchanged. The risk of a slight pullback or normalization (a 'No' outcome) appears slightly higher than the chance of sustained momentum carrying over into another month of positive growth (a 'Yes' outcome). Therefore, I am maintaining my original forecast.",
