  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. The Texas Legislature's regular session ends May 26, 2025, which is only 12 days away.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No ban is enacted. The Texas House has demonstrated clear resistance to a full THC ban by creating a substitute version of SB 3 that is not a complete ban, and by advancing HB 46 which expands medical cannabis access instead.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular legislative session ends on May 26 without a full THC ban passing both chambers. The House maintains its position supporting the substitute version that allows some THC products. Either no special session is called by Governor Abbott before July 1, or if called, it doesn't include the THC ban on the agenda or fails to pass a full ban through both chambers before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the remaining 12 days of the regular session, the House reverses course and passes the full Senate version of SB 3, reconciling differences quickly, and Governor Abbott signs it into law. Alternatively, immediately after the regular session ends, Governor Abbott calls a special session specifically to address the THC ban, the House changes its stance under pressure from Lieutenant Governor Patrick, and a full ban is passed and signed before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome for several compelling reasons. First, the Texas House has already demonstrated clear opposition by passing its own bill (HB 46) with overwhelming support (118-16) that expands medical cannabis access rather than restricting it, and by creating a substitute version of SB 3 that is explicitly not a full ban but allows certain low-THC products while prohibiting only vapes and synthetics. This shows the House's position is fundamentally at odds with the Senate's full ban approach. Second, the timeline is extraordinarily tight - only 12 days remain in the regular session, and for a full ban to become law, the House would need to abandon its demonstrated position, pass the Senate version, reconcile any differences, and get it signed by the governor while managing all other end-of-session priorities. Third, Governor Abbott has not included a THC ban among his stated priorities for the session, which suggests limited executive support for this initiative. The special session path faces even steeper obstacles: only Governor Abbott can call one, he hasn't indicated willingness to do so for this issue, and even if called immediately after May 26, it would need to be completed within about a month while overcoming the same House resistance. The economic and political headwinds are substantial: an $8 billion hemp industry with thousands of businesses at stake, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller's opposition, veterans' groups testifying against the ban, and strong public opinion favoring expanded access (62% support legalization, 79% support medical programs according to University of Houston polling). While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick is pushing aggressively and the Senate did pass SB 3 with a strong 25-6 vote, the Lieutenant Governor cannot unilaterally force a special session or change the House's position. My forecast is not lower (closer to 1-2%) because politics can occasionally produce surprising outcomes under intense pressure, especially with such a determined advocate as Lt. Gov. Patrick, and there remains a technical possibility of rapid legislative movement in the final days. My forecast is not higher (15-20%+) because the House has already publicly committed to an alternative approach, the timeline is prohibitively short, and neither the governor nor public opinion appear to support a full ban. I would update significantly higher if the House suddenly passes a full ban version in the coming days or if Governor Abbott makes strong public statements prioritizing this issue. I would update lower if the regular session ends without progress or if Abbott indicates he won't call a special session for this purpose.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.
