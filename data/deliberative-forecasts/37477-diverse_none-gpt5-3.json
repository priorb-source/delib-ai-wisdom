    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key asymmetry: only one clean day is needed. New, useful angles they add: (1) weekend/holiday editorial dynamics (WSJ’s Weekend edition; Memorial Day) can lower the odds of tariff mentions; (2) positive correlation between the papers’ topic selection means a big non-tariff story boosts the chance both omit tariffs on the same day. These push the probability up relative to a purely independent-days view. I still find 70% a bit high given WSJ’s habitual inclusion of trade bullets on the front and the ongoing, policy-heavy phase that can sustain daily mentions. The 55% forecast feels low if we credit correlation/holiday effects and the relatively long remaining window. Overall, their arguments nudge me slightly upward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "We need just one day by May 31 when both front pages omit the exact word “tariff(s).” Roughly 20 qualifying print days remain (WSJ doesn’t publish Sundays). Correlated editorial choices mean that when a major non-tariff story dominates, both papers are likelier to skip the term simultaneously. Upcoming weekends and the Memorial Day period also tend to diversify or soften policy coverage, improving the odds of a clean day. Countervailing factors: tariffs are a marquee, rolling policy theme right now; WSJ’s front page (especially “What’s News”) increases the chance of a small, day-saving mention; and any late-May policy moves or market reactions could keep the term live. Netting these, I modestly raise my estimate to reflect correlation and calendar effects but stay below Forecaster 2’s 70% due to WSJ’s propensity for frequent mentions and the requirement that both omit on the same day. Update: from 60% to 63%.",
