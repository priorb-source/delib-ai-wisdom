    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two key points I agree with: (1) strong, very recent political ownership of the exclusion (Premier/Minister backing; policy framed as Canadian-preference/U.S.-exclusion) and (2) the resolution hinges narrowly on whether the specified page explicitly names Tesla. New useful angles they added: the broader retaliatory/trade-policy context in Canada/B.C. likely points toward maintaining, not softening, the stance; and the communications rationale to keep Tesla explicitly named to reduce consumer confusion. I also appreciate the identification of risks that would resolve No without a policy change: a shift to origin-based generic language, a site refresh/page restructure, or archiving/simplifying the page. I find their reasoning largely convincing and aligned with my prior view. The only caveat is that naming a brand can invite legal/comms caution, but since BC Hydro already did so in March, near-term removal seems less likely absent a deliberate comms pivot.",
    "rationale": "Status quo and political incentives point to continuity through July 1. The policy is fresh (March 12), publicly defended, and consistent with broader domestic-preference/retaliatory measures; there’s minimal time for reversal. Consumer clarity likely favors keeping Tesla called out explicitly on the exact rebate page. The main downside risk is purely procedural/communication: BC Hydro could update the page to generic country-of-origin language or restructure content around quarter-turn timing, which would resolve No even if the exclusion persists. I weight that risk as material but <1-in-4 over the next month. Net effect: slight upward nudge from my prior given strong political ownership and the salience/clarity benefit of explicitly naming Tesla.",
