    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the knife‑edge setup and emphasize two useful points: (1) the specific rounding/display risk on the FRED/OECD series near 0.0%, and (2) domestic energy’s continued YoY weakness despite higher Brent, likely due to regulation/tariffs—limiting the chance of an upside energy swing in May. They also highlight May Day services strength as a plausible but probably insufficient offset. These are broadly consistent with my view; the added focus on electricity/regulated components and the practical FRED rounding risk are incremental refinements rather than directional shifts. I find their weighting toward the status quo (slightly negative headline) reasonable given three straight negative prints, weak PMIs, deep PPI deflation, and ongoing pork weakness.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 58% Yes. After considering the peers’ arguments, I still see the modal outcome as a marginally negative print, with risks on rounding/measurement that could flip the resolution. The incremental points on regulated energy/tariffs and the explicit FRED rounding/display risk slightly strengthen the case that headline remains just below zero, but they also cap how high I can go because a tiny positive (or a displayed 0.0%) remains plausible given holiday services and slightly firmer oil base effects. Net, I make a small upward adjustment to reflect the status quo bias and continued food/energy drag, while keeping the forecast close to even to respect the boundary risk. Change: 58% -> 60%.",
