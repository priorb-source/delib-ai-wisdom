    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the bill does not complete passage and receive presidential assent by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill remains in committee, or passes only one chamber, or both chambers pass it but harmonization and/or presidential assent slips into July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The National Assembly fast-tracks the Tax Reforms Bill (or a narrower finance/tax bill) in May–June, both chambers pass aligned texts, and the President assents before July 1, with language explicitly exempting real estate transactions from VAT.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Fewer than two months remain. In Nigeria, a bill typically needs first and second readings, committee review, report, third reading in each chamber, harmonization (if needed), transmission, and presidential assent. This can be compressed but usually requires strong executive/legislative prioritization.\n- Policy priority: The Tinubu administration’s tax-reform agenda is active, and credible reports (e.g., April 25, 2025 Nairametrics) indicate a bill under consideration to exempt real estate transactions from VAT. Alignment between the executive and National Assembly increases feasibility of fast-tracking, particularly if framed as supporting housing affordability.\n- Countervailing forces: VAT is a key non-oil revenue source; exemptions reduce near-term revenue unless offset elsewhere. Comprehensive tax packages often face negotiation delays. The omnibus nature of reforms can slow passage compared with a narrow, standalone fix.\n- Base rate/status quo: Many Nigerian tax/finance bills slip timelines; absent clear signs of fast-tracking, the default within a sub-2-month window is no enactment by the deadline.\n- Why not higher: Limited time, potential fiscal pushback, and typical legislative friction argue against >50%.\n- Why not lower: Executive backing, public signaling of the reform, and the assembly’s capacity to move priority bills quickly keep the chance meaningfully above a long-shot.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of (a) passage in either chamber and scheduled concurrence in the other; (b) committee reports already filed and leadership designating the bill as priority; (c) credible reporting that the VAT exemption language will remain intact through harmonization; (d) the measure being carved into a smaller, fast-track finance bill.\n- What would move me down: Reports of committee delays, significant opposition over revenue impact, bundling with contentious provisions, or an approaching recess/packed calendar that crowds out tax legislation.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information beyond the cited media reports; thus, the forecast leans on general legislative process dynamics and known executive priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
