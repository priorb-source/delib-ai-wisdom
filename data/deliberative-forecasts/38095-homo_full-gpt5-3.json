    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: an active clemency pipeline, very low threshold (>2), and explicit signals of more to come. They also rightly highlight the month-to-month lumpiness and a plausible July 4 clustering risk after the late‑May blitz. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point that this White House tends to publicize clemencies, lowering the risk that actions go uncounted. Forecaster 3 underscores that even a small, themed or blanket action would instantly clear the bar. I find their reasoning sound. The main incremental consideration they push is the strategic timing risk for a deliberate June lull in favor of an Independence Day package, which I slightly underweighted. One nuance I’d add is that the question requires grants in June but only requires that they be publicly disclosed at some point, which reduces the risk that actions granted in June fail to count merely due to announcement timing. Still, the July 4 timing risk is real enough to trim the probability modestly.",
    "rationale": "The baseline remains that the administration has both appetite and capacity for frequent clemency use, and we just need more than two individuals in June. Recent activity (a late‑May spree) shows the pipeline is hot. Personnel are in place to sustain throughput. Signals suggest more actions are in the queue. Against that, month‑specific timing risk is elevated immediately following a high‑profile batch; a purposeful pause to bunch for July 4 is plausible, and June in Trump’s first term saw no clemencies (though behavior this term differs markedly). Considering the added emphasis from peers on the July 4 clustering risk, I’m shading down slightly from my prior 86% while still keeping a strong Yes leaning given how low the threshold is and the current operational tempo.",
