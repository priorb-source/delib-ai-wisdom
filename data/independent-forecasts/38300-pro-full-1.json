  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The official data for May 2025 from FRED is scheduled for release around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The outcome would be 'Yes'. Year-over-year industrial production growth was positive and accelerating in the months leading up to May 2025, reaching +1.49% in April. A continuation of this trend would result in a positive reading.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if the persistent contraction in civil non-energy processing industries accelerates sharply in May. This, combined with softening domestic demand signaled by the recent large drop in the Leading Economic Index (LEI) and a decline in producer prices, leads to a significant month-over-month decrease in the total index, pulling the year-over-year growth figure below zero.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is realized as continued strength in oil extraction and a rebound in auto assemblies successfully counteract the weakness in other manufacturing sectors. The expansionary territory of the May ISM and S&P Global PMIs accurately reflects modest overall growth, ensuring the year-over-year calculation remains positive, building upon the solid +1.49% base from April.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant positive momentum leading into May 2025. The year-over-year (YoY) growth rate accelerated for four consecutive months, reaching a solid +1.49% in April. This creates a substantial buffer, meaning a large month-over-month contraction in May would be required to push the YoY figure into negative territory. Supporting a 'Yes' outcome are the positive May PMI readings from both ISM and S&P Global, which are contemporaneous indicators of manufacturing activity, as well as specific strength in the auto and energy sectors. However, I am tempering the probability due to significant headwinds. The Conference Board’s LEI saw its largest drop since March 2023, and the core PPI declined for the first time since 2020; both are strong leading indicators of a potential slowdown. Furthermore, there is persistent weakness in non-energy manufacturing and a slowing global economic environment. I weigh the existing momentum and positive contemporaneous PMIs more heavily for this single-month forecast than the more bearish, forward-looking indicators. My probability is not higher because the LEI and PPI drops are serious warning signs that cannot be dismissed and indicate growing fragility. It is not lower because the +1.49% YoY buffer from April is substantial, and positive PMIs make a sudden, sharp contraction in May less likely. I would update my forecast downwards on news of a major supply chain disruption or if prior months' data were revised significantly lower. Conversely, I would update upwards if other high-frequency data for May, like retail sales, showed unexpected strength.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April.
