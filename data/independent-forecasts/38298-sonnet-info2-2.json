  "information": "Several regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data approximately 2-3 weeks after month end. Since today is June 2, 2025, the May 2025 data should be available within approximately 1-2 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - May 2025 is not the hottest May on record. Historically, most months do not set global temperature records even during warming periods. The most likely outcome is that May 2025 ranks among the warmest Mays on record but falls short of the absolute record, likely set during the strong El Niño period of 2023-2024.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 does not break the record because the El Niño warming that boosted 2023-2024 temperatures has fully dissipated, transitioning toward neutral or La Niña conditions. Regional cooling events like the significant below-normal temperatures in India (3.3°C below normal) prove more widespread than initially apparent, offsetting hot spots in Europe and North America. The global average remains in the top 3-5 warmest Mays but below the recent record.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 sets a new record because the underlying warming trend from climate change alone is sufficient to exceed previous records even without El Niño. The European heat events (UK's warmest May 1st on record, Scottish heat records, French records) and unusual North American warmth (32°C in International Falls, Minnesota) represent broader global patterns. Ocean heat content remains elevated enough to push global temperatures past the May 2024 or May 2023 record.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for setting global monthly temperature records is inherently low - even during rapid warming, only a fraction of months achieve this. Recent years 2023-2024 saw exceptional warmth due to El Niño superimposed on baseline warming, and May 2024 (or possibly May 2023) likely holds the current record. By June 2025, El Niño conditions have likely transitioned toward neutral or La Niña, removing a significant warming factor that typically adds 0.1-0.2°C to global temperatures.\n\nThe research assistant's report presents mixed signals. Negative evidence includes Ahmedabad, India experiencing one of its coolest Mays in recent years, 3.3°C below normal due to record rainfall - this represents significant regional cooling in a populous area. Positive evidence includes multiple heat records: UK's warmest May 1st (28°C), Scotland's 25.4°C on May 13th, Brittany's May record of 31.1°C on May 30th, and International Falls, Minnesota reaching 32°C in early May - notably anomalous for that location.\n\nHowever, these regional reports are inherently selective and may not represent global patterns. Setting a global record requires exceptional warmth across most of the planet, not just in cherry-picked locations. The significant Indian cooling suggests considerable regional variation rather than uniformly exceptional heat.\n\nI'm not forecasting higher because: (1) the base rate for records is low, (2) El Niño's boost has faded, (3) significant regional cooling occurred in major population centers, and (4) the regional heat reports, while notable, may not reflect global patterns. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) multiple independently-confirmed European records suggest real widespread warmth, (2) the baseline warming trend continues inexorably, (3) unusual heat in unexpected locations like International Falls indicates potentially broad warmth, and (4) we're only seeing limited regional samples.\n\nTo update higher, I would need evidence that ocean temperatures remained exceptionally elevated and that the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions experienced well-above-average warmth. To update lower, I would need evidence of widespread cooling in ocean temperatures or significant below-normal temperatures across multiple major regions beyond India.",
