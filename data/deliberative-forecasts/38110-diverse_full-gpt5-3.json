    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I used: security-driven closure, deteriorating threat picture (AFRICOM), compressed timeline, and poor base rates for ≤60‑day reopenings. They emphasize the remaining window (≈31 days) and treat the 20% “within 60 days” base rate as an anchor—Forecaster 2 comes close to treating it as a ceiling. I agree with the thrust, though I wouldn’t view 20% as a strict ceiling. The 2019–2020 Nigeria closure is a useful cautionary example but not fully analogous (that was a broad, domestically driven policy stance rather than a targeted security response). The mention of ECOWAS channels is fair, but ECOWAS’ diminished leverage after recent regional rifts tempers that upside. Net, I didn’t see new factual evidence, but the emphasis on the ultra-short runway and lack of any signaling for relief is persuasive and consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "Core drivers remain unfavorable: (1) explicit security rationale (arms smuggling, emergent militant group) typically implies longer closures; (2) AFRICOM’s late‑May note of deteriorating conditions argues against near‑term relaxation; (3) zero public signaling from either government of imminent reopening. Offsetting pressures include economic pain for border communities and seasonal trade (cashew season runs into June), which could motivate a limited, conditions‑based reopening of specific Kwara crossings with enhanced screening or joint patrols. ECOWAS facilitation is a theoretical channel, but current regional politics reduce odds of rapid, effective mediation. Geography also cuts both ways: Baruten/Taneru is less economically central than Sèmè‑Kraké, lowering Benin’s cost of keeping it shut, though Benin’s extension of security operations toward major corridors shows broad concern rather than de‑escalation. Given the short time left and requirement for credible reporting before July 1, the ‘Yes’ path would likely require a quick, visible, partial reopening tied to a joint security arrangement or holiday/seasonal trade carve‑out. I slightly nudge my estimate up from 14% to 15% to reflect seasonal economic pressure and the possibility of a narrowly scoped reopening, but the balance of evidence still favors ‘No.’",
