    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this question. We all identified the high degree of bureaucratic inertia in State Department travel advisories and the very short time frame until resolution (less than two months) as the primary factors favoring a 'No' outcome. We unanimously agree that a change to Level 3 would require a significant triggering event, such as a major terrorist attack or a sharp increase in violent crime targeting foreigners, for which there is currently no public evidence. Forecaster 2's point about the Tanzanian general election being scheduled for late 2025, after the resolution date, was a useful piece of information I hadn't explicitly considered. It strengthens the 'No' case by removing a potential source of near-term instability from the forecast window. The slight difference between my/Forecaster 3's 10% and Forecaster 2's 15% reflects a minor variance in estimating the tail risk of a sudden, severe incident, rather than a fundamental disagreement in analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial reasoning has been reinforced by the deliberation process. The consensus among the forecasters is strong: the combination of bureaucratic inertia and the very short time frame makes a change in the travel advisory highly unlikely. The arguments from the other forecasters, particularly the point from Forecaster 2 that the next general election—a potential catalyst for instability—is scheduled for after the resolution date, strengthens my conviction in my initial forecast. The existing Level 2 advisory already accounts for the known risks of crime and terrorism. For an upgrade to Level 3, the State Department would need to see a significant and sustained deterioration in security, or a single high-impact event that fundamentally changes the risk assessment for American travelers. With no indicators of such a change, the probability remains low. I am maintaining my forecast at 10%, as this appropriately captures the high likelihood of the status quo prevailing while still acknowledging the non-zero chance of an unforeseen, severe security incident.",
