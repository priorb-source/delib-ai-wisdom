  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until end of May 4, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no candidacy announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han remains caretaker/acting president, emphasizes governance and ongoing negotiations, PPP moves forward without him, he does not resign by May 4 and makes no candidacy declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid late draft: PPP leadership reverses course and waives primary rules to anoint him, or he declares as an independent. He issues a public statement/press conference explicitly announcing his presidential candidacy before May 5, likely paired with a resignation by May 4 to maintain eligibility.",
    "rationale": "The window is very short, and the default path points to no announcement. Constraints: (1) Legal/eligibility clock — he must resign by May 4; (2) Party process — he missed the April 15 PPP primary registration and leadership has said he won’t be included; (3) Norms — caretaker heads of state running is discouraged; (4) Politics — weak polling (2%–12%) and 66% finding his candidacy unacceptable; (5) Operations — no visible campaign infrastructure. These all raise the cost of announcing and make a viable path unclear. Supporting a non-zero chance: a sizable PPP faction (reports of 50+ lawmakers and a support committee) is pushing a draft, and Korean parties can be procedurally flexible under time pressure. Han has kept the option open publicly (“not yet decided”), and the May 4 resignation deadline creates a forcing function that could trigger a last-minute move if intra-party dynamics shift. Why not higher: party leadership opposition, missed primary deadline, low public support, and the reputational/governance costs of resigning from an acting presidency without a clear path all weigh heavily against a late candidacy. Why not lower: visible draft efforts and residual option value mean a last-minute announcement is plausible, especially if PPP sees him as a unity or emergency choice. Upward updates: credible reports that PPP will change rules or adopt a draft mechanism; endorsements from key party leaders; sudden polling improvement; formation of a campaign team; scheduling of a resignation press conference. Downward updates: PPP finalizes/locks its nominee and rules; Han explicitly rules out running; continued negative polling or elite pushback; no preparatory moves as May 4 approaches.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
