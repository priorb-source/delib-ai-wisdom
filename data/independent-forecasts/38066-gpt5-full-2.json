  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "≈20 days until the event window opens (Jun 16, 7:59 AM PDT); ≈22 days until it closes (Jun 18, 00:00 PDT). If evidence remains unclear, resolution by Jul 1.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both deliver separate keynotes/fireside chats with no overlap; Musk appears remotely; or Musk cancels/arrives late, resulting in no moment where both are physically on the stage together.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/debate; an opening/closing plenary or panel includes both; or one briefly joins to introduce/hand off to the other, creating a simultaneous on-stage overlap.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Even when two headline speakers are booked at the same conference, it’s uncommon that they share a stage unless the organizer explicitly programs a joint session. Given their public rivalry, the status quo outcome is that they appear separately.   Evidence pushing probability up: - YC has announced both Sam Altman and Elon Musk as headline speakers, creating a rare opportunity and strong PR incentive for a joint moment. - The research assistant notes conciliatory gestures from Altman in May 2025, including an “olive branch” inviting collaboration on AGI and some informal team contacts. If relations are thawing, a joint stage moment would be a powerful symbolic signal to the AI community and the press.   Evidence pushing probability down: - The Altman–Musk relationship has been adversarial (e.g., lawsuit history and, per the assistant, a hostile bid for OpenAI), making agreement on a joint appearance nontrivial. - Musk’s attendance risk: he is known for last‑minute schedule changes and sometimes cancels or opts for remote participation, any of which would kill the chance of a joint on-stage moment under the question’s criteria. - Event logistics: YC can capture value by giving each a dedicated slot without the risks of a confrontation overshadowing the program. Unless YC explicitly engineers a joint session, default scheduling likely avoids overlap.   Rough decomposition (illustrative): - P(Musk attends in person) ~ 60–70% - P(Altman attends in person) ~ 90%+ - P(shared stage | both attend) ~ 25–40% (requires YC to program it or allow a deliberate handoff/photo op) Multiplying midpoints points to a low‑to‑mid 20s percentage overall.   Why not higher? No public joint session announced yet; adversarial history; meaningful chance of Musk not appearing in person; organizers may prefer separate appearances.   Why not lower? Both are confirmed headliners at a two‑day event, creating multiple coordination opportunities; YC has strong incentives to produce a marquee moment; the reported olive branch marginally increases cooperation likelihood.   What would move me up: - Official agenda showing a joint session, panel, or opening/closing plenary with both; - Public hints from YC, Altman, or Musk about a conversation/debate; - News of a détente (e.g., co-written note, joint meeting) ahead of the event.   What would move me down: - Published schedule showing strictly separate talks with no shared sessions; - Confirmation that Musk will appear remotely or is skipping; - Renewed public hostilities or legal escalation close to the event; - YC communications emphasizing separate appearances or security-driven stage management to keep them apart.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
