  "information": "Starlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days, from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently Lesotho has been granted a Starlink license but does not appear as 'Available' on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving a license on April 14, 2025, Starlink faces unexpected delays in launching service in Lesotho. These could include infrastructure challenges, prioritization of other markets, or additional regulatory steps. The company doesn't update its availability map before the July 1 deadline, and the question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes its service setup in Lesotho and updates its availability map to show the country as 'Available' within the next 8 weeks. This follows a pattern similar to DRC where the company moved quickly from license approval to service announcement. With 55 days remaining, there is ample time for Starlink to activate service.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between the promising DRC precedent and the concerning delay already observed. The DRC received a license around May 3-5 and had service availability announced by May 5 - essentially a 2-day turnaround. However, Lesotho granted its license on April 14, and we're now 23 days later with no service announcement. This delay is significant and suggests either specific complications in Lesotho or deprioritization compared to other markets. Against this, there are strong positive factors: (1) The license has been granted, which is the major regulatory hurdle; (2) There are still 55 days until the deadline - plenty of time for activation; (3) Starlink is actively expanding in Africa and has demonstrated capability to launch quickly; (4) Lesotho is small and landlocked, but this hasn't prevented service in similar contexts. The delay makes me cautious about placing probability too high - if it were as straightforward as DRC, we'd likely have seen movement by now. However, the substantial time remaining and cleared regulatory path prevent the probability from going too low. I'm not going higher because the 23-day delay with no news is unexplained and concerning. I'm not going lower because 55 days is a long runway and the hardest step (licensing) is complete. To update higher, I'd need to see any official announcement of imminent launch or evidence of preparatory activity. To update lower, another 2-3 weeks passing without news would be very concerning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied.

The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
