    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - as of May 20, 2025, President Trump has not yet issued a presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa program during his second term",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues focusing on other immigration priorities (border security, enforcement, etc.) without issuing a specific presidential action that mentions the Diversity Visa program by name. Any immigration-related actions in the next 6 weeks either don't address this program or use different terminology that doesn't include the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa'",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or proclamation attempting to suspend, terminate, or reform the Diversity Visa lottery program, explicitly using the term 'Diversity Visa' in the text. This could be triggered by recent DV-2026 lottery results or as part of a broader immigration policy push. The action is published on the White House presidential actions page before July 1",
    "rationale": "Trump has historically opposed the Diversity Visa program and called for its elimination during his first term. The background articles confirm this stance. However, several factors weigh against a Yes outcome: (1) Trump has already been in office for approximately 4 months (since January 20, 2025) without issuing such an action, suggesting it's not among his immediate priorities; (2) The timeframe remaining is relatively short at only 42 days; (3) The requirement is very specific - must use the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' and must be a formal presidential action on whitehouse.gov, not just a social media post or verbal statement; (4) Immigration actions so far have likely focused on border security and enforcement rather than visa lottery programs. The base rate principle suggests the status quo (no action) is most likely since nothing has happened yet. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence that Trump is actively working on Diversity Visa policy (leaks, statements from administration officials, or draft orders). For it to move lower, evidence that his immigration focus is entirely elsewhere or that legal/political constraints prevent such action. My forecast balances Trump's known opposition and capability to act quickly against the momentum of the status quo and the short remaining timeframe",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
