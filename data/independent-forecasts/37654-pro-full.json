  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective is currently marked 'In progress'. If no formal action is taken to change this status, it will resolve as 'No' on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to weaken NOAA through budget cuts and program cancellations, actions which are reflected by the 'In progress' status. However, no formal executive order or legislation to 'break up' the agency is signed before the July 1, 2025 deadline, so the tracker's status remains unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Citing the need for governmental efficiency, the administration fast-tracks an executive reorganization plan that was already in development. An Executive Order is signed in late June 2025 that formally dissolves NOAA and transfers its core functions to other departments, such as the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense. The moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker update the objective's status to 'Complete' in response to this formal action.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is 15%. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the extremely short timeline of approximately 1.5 months. Formally breaking up a federal agency like NOAA is a complex process. Historical data indicates that even executive reorganizations, the faster of the two possible paths, typically take a minimum of two months to be finalized and signed. The legislative path is not viable within this timeframe. Furthermore, the resolution criteria are stringent, requiring a formal action such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute for the tracker's status to be changed to 'Complete'. The actions taken to date, such as discontinuing the Billion-Dollar Disasters database and proposing budget cuts, are significant and justify the current 'In progress' status, but they do not meet the high bar for completion. The low base rate of other objectives on the tracker moving from 'In progress' to 'Complete' (5 of 41 in 4.5 months) also supports a low probability. The probability is not lower than 15% because the administration has demonstrated clear momentum and intent. The recent discontinuation of a major database signals that this is a high-priority item, and it is possible that an executive order has been in development for some time and could be fast-tracked. The probability is not higher because the procedural and legal hurdles to a formal agency reorganization are substantial. With only 46 days remaining, the status quo is the most likely outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
