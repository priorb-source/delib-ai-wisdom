    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key drivers of this question, resulting in very similar forecasts (15%, 18%, 15%). We all identify the recently extended temporary restraining order (TRO) and the short timeline (~7 weeks) as the primary factors favoring a 'No' outcome. We also all acknowledge the significant political pressure from the Trump administration as the main argument for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly insightful, adding legal nuance that I had not fully considered. They highlighted the high probability of further delays from appeals, such as securing an 'administrative stay' from the Third Circuit even if the district court lifts the TRO, and the non-instantaneous logistical hurdles ICE would face (e.g., securing travel documents). This 'cascade' of necessary government victories reinforces the low probability of deportation by the deadline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. My initial reasoning—that the procedural hurdles of the U.S. legal system are likely to outlast the short 47-day timeline despite strong political pressure for deportation—has been reinforced, not altered. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of the legal process strengthens my conviction. For a 'Yes' outcome, not only must the district court quickly dissolve the TRO against a claim it just days ago called 'plausible,' but Khalil's legal team would also have to fail to secure an administrative stay from the appellate court, and ICE would need to have all logistical arrangements prepared for immediate action. The probability of this entire sequence occurring before July 1 is low. While Forecaster 2's slightly higher number (18%) is reasonable and reflects a greater weighting of the administration's political will, the additional procedural roadblocks detailed by Forecaster 3 persuade me that my initial, more conservative estimate remains the most accurate. The deliberation has not changed my forecast but has increased my confidence in the reasoning behind it.",
