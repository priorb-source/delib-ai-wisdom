    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6.5 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement of a specific date for a general (parliamentary) election before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling SNS-led majority swiftly nominates and confirms a new prime minister and cabinet, avoiding dissolution. Government communications emphasize continuity and legislative priorities; any talk of elections is pushed to an undefined future, with no formal decree setting an election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the prime minister’s resignation, coalition negotiations stall or the president opts to dissolve the assembly for strategic reasons. The presidency or relevant electoral authority issues an official decree naming a specific date (likely in late summer or autumn 2025) before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time window: Only ~6.5 weeks remain for an official announcement. Even if leaders intend an autumn election, Serbia typically announces snap polls closer to the vote (e.g., 6–10 weeks lead), making a pre–July 1 announcement possible but not necessary.\n- Status quo weight: Serbia held parliamentary elections in Dec 2023. The SNS-led bloc has repeatedly demonstrated capacity to form governments without resorting to immediate new elections. Barring a coalition breakdown, the default is to appoint a new PM rather than dissolve parliament.\n- Institutional mechanics: A PM’s resignation raises the hazard of a snap election, but the constitution allows the president to nominate a PM-designate; if a majority exists (as is typical for SNS and allied parties), a new government can be confirmed. Only failure to form a cabinet within the constitutional window pushes toward dissolution.\n- Base rates and leadership strategy: Serbia has a history of frequent snap elections, which keeps the probability non-trivial. However, with a relatively fresh mandate (Dec 2023) and a functioning majority, the near-term incentive to announce another general election in the next 6.5 weeks is limited unless leadership seeks to preempt worsening conditions or capitalize on favorable polling.\n- Why not higher: Short time left; a viable parliamentary majority can likely install a new PM; leadership tends to time announcements tactically and may aim for a later window. If they target autumn 2025, an announcement might come after July 1.\n- Why not lower: Confirmed PM resignation (per the background article) increases the chance of snap elections versus a normal period. Serbia’s leadership has used snap polls as a tool repeatedly, so a sudden decision remains plausible.\n- What would move me up: Clear signs of coalition rupture; president indicating intent to dissolve the assembly; failure to agree on a PM-designate; scheduling of dissolution votes; credible reports of an imminent decree with a proposed election date.\n- What would move me down: Rapid nomination and parliamentary confirmation of a new PM; public commitments to governing out the term; parliamentary calendar focused on regular legislation; credible leadership statements ruling out snap elections before summer.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the background note; no additional new information provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
