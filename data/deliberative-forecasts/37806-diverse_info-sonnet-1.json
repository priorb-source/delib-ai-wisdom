    "review": "Both forecasters raise valuable points. Forecaster 3's observation about official documents typically using 'Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) program' rather than the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' is particularly compelling and represents a constraint I underweighted. This phraseology issue could cause a miss even if Trump addresses the program. Forecaster 2's point about the SAFE for America Act providing a legislative path is also important - the administration might prefer permanent Congressional action over vulnerable executive measures. However, Forecaster 2's 30% seems too optimistic given the 5-month track record of inaction and only 42 days remaining. Both correctly emphasize competing priorities (border, asylum, parole) that have dominated the immigration agenda. The 'catalyst event' scenario (high-profile crime) is plausible but speculative without evidence. The spread from 14% to 30% reflects genuine uncertainty, but the exact phrase requirement and sustained inaction pattern favor the lower end.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating downward from 18% to 16%, primarily driven by Forecaster 3's excellent point about official nomenclature. Government documents consistently use 'Diversity Immigrant Visa' or 'DV program' rather than the bare phrase 'Diversity Visa.' Even if Trump issues an action targeting this program, the resolution criteria's strict requirement creates an additional hurdle beyond policy intent. The 5-month inaction pattern remains the strongest evidence - if this were a priority, the administration had ample opportunity. With only 42 days left and immigration bandwidth focused on border/enforcement/parole issues, the window is narrow. I'm not going as low as 14% because Trump's documented opposition and prolific use of immigration actions maintains some probability, and the phrase 'Diversity Visa' does appear in some contexts. I'm not staying at 18% or going to 30% because the phraseology constraint and time constraints are more binding than I initially assessed.",
