    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize governance cadence and the short time window, which I agree are the dominant factors. Forecaster 2’s point about decisions often clustering around congresses/events later in the year strengthens the base-rate case for no announcement by July 1. Forecaster 3 adds a new and important wrinkle I hadn’t explicitly considered: event-name ambiguity (“World Cup” vs “World Championship”), which could lead to announcements that don’t meet the resolution criteria—this lowers odds. I share their view that small federations can act quickly and that Egypt’s capability plus the April 29 meeting keep a non-trivial path to Yes alive. Overall, I find their reasoning largely convincing and incrementally bearish relative to my prior, mainly due to the naming/criteria risk and the lack of any sign of an imminent ITKF decision meeting.",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: About 7 weeks remain (as of May 8, 2025) for an ITKF announcement before the July 1 deadline.\nb) Status quo outcome: No announcement yet on ITKF channels; absent new signals, inertia favors No by the deadline.\nc) No scenario: ITKF defers 2026 host selection to a later-2025 congress; or selects another host; or issues an Egyptian announcement about a different event (e.g., “World Cup”) that doesn’t satisfy the “World Championship” criterion; or continued silence through June.\nd) Yes scenario: ITKF Executive Council/Board meets in late May/June and formally awards 2026 to Egypt, followed by an official ITKF press release or website post naming Egypt as the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship host.\ne) Rationale: The April 29 high-level meeting and Egypt’s strong recent hosting record create a plausible fast-track. Lack of visible competing bids also helps. However, historical patterns suggest hosts are usually announced earlier, and small federations often batch such decisions around mid/late-year assemblies—tilting toward delay beyond July 1. Critically, the resolution requires an explicit ITKF announcement of the World Championship host; the referenced article’s “World Cup” wording introduces a non-trivial mislabeling risk. With no signs of an imminent ITKF decision or agenda items, the balance of evidence is modestly negative for a pre-July 1 announcement.\nChange from prior: I’m nudging down from 30% to 27% based on the added naming/criteria risk and reinforcing arguments about procedural timing without any new near-term meeting signals.",
