    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two crucial pieces of new evidence that I had not considered. Forecaster 2 highlighted a very recent (May 2025) $450M Series G funding round and a $200M tender offer. Forecaster 3 provided direct quotes from CEO Parker Conrad, also from May 2025, stating the company has 'no specific plans to go public' and an IPO is 'not imminent.' Their reasoning is extremely convincing. This evidence, both the company's actions (raising private capital, offering a tender) and the CEO's explicit words, provides a much stronger and more specific basis for a forecast than my initial analysis, which relied on more general factors like the legal battle and market conditions. The combination of these points makes a 'No' outcome overwhelmingly likely.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the new, dispositive evidence presented by the other forecasters. My initial forecast of 12% was based on the short timeline and the distraction of the Deel lawsuit, but I critically lacked information on Rippling's recent financing and public statements. The new evidence shows that in May 2025, Rippling both raised a large private round and received a direct, public denial from its CEO about imminent IPO plans. A company that has just secured $450M in private capital and is providing employee liquidity via a tender offer has minimal financial or internal pressure to rush to an IPO in the next 39 days. More importantly, the CEO's unambiguous statements that an IPO is 'not imminent' and that there are 'no specific plans' are the strongest possible arguments against a 'Yes' resolution. While CEOs can engage in strategic misdirection, making such a strong denial just to announce an IPO weeks later would be highly unusual. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 12% to 4%. The remaining probability accounts for the very slim tail risk of a surprise strategic reversal.",
