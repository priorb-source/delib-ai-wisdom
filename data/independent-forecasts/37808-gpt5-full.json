  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes and the President signs a law terminating the DV program before July 1, prompting State to rapidly remove DV entry instruction pages; or State/Travel.state.gov reorganizes the DV section and retires/moves the specific URL so it returns a 404/non-instruction page; or an agency directive leads to removal of “Diversity Visa” pages; or an outage occurs exactly when Metaculus attempts access and the page is unavailable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains online at the same URL, likely stating that the entry period is closed and providing general instructions and warnings, pending the next entry window in October/November 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: The DV program is statutory (Immigration Act of 1990). The DV-2026 results were released in May 2025 and processing continues through FY2026. Historically, the State Department keeps evergreen DV instruction pages up year-round and updates them around the fall entry period. Under the prior Trump administration, the program was criticized but not removed, and the webpages remained accessible.\n- Political/administrative risk: A House bill to terminate the DV program was introduced in April 2025, and the administration is skeptical of DV. However, passage by both chambers and enactment before July 1 is unlikely on this short timeline. DEI-related website directives are adjacent rather than directly applicable to a statutory immigration program page, making abrupt removal less likely.\n- Technical/website risk: travel.state.gov occasionally reorganizes content. A URL change or depublication could occur, or a redirect might fail the literal criterion if Metaculus requires the page to be at that exact location. Short-lived outages are possible but uncommon.\n- Assistant’s info incorporated: DV-2026 results posted in early May 2025; DV-2025 results posted May 3, 2025; registration was Oct–Nov 2024; dvprogram.state.gov is the official results portal. These indicate the program is actively in use and State has reason to keep instructions visible between cycles.\n- Why not higher: Non-trivial risks include a rapid legislative/administrative move to end DV and remove entry instructions, a web content migration breaking the exact URL, or a misinterpreted compliance step leading to removal/renaming. Also, resolution hinges on that specific URL hosting instructions on/after July 1.\n- Why not lower: The program’s statutory basis and ongoing processing create strong inertia to keep information pages online. Large federal website changes typically take time and use redirects. Similar pages have historically persisted outside the entry window.\n- Updates: I would raise the forecast if there’s confirmation of site content freeze/continuity, explicit State messaging about the fall DV-2027 entry period, or if the Federal Register/State’s newsroom shows routine DV communications. I would lower it if the House bill advances rapidly with Senate momentum and White House backing for immediate termination, if State posts a notice pausing DV or removing “Submit an Entry” guidance, or if travel.state.gov announces a content replatform that retires legacy URLs without guaranteed redirects.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
