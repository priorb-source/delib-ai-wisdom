    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation and verification process extends beyond July 1, 2025. This could occur if Johnsonville faces delays in completing corrective actions, if FSIS requires additional verification of product removal from commerce, or if complications arise during the effectiveness checks. The recall remains Active past the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville successfully completes all required corrective actions within the next 53 days, removes all affected product from distribution channels, implements preventive measures, and FSIS conducts and completes its verification activities. The agency determines all requirements are satisfied and changes the recall status to Closed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This recall was issued 34 days ago (April 5, 2025), leaving 53 days until the resolution date. The total window of approximately 87 days (about 2.9 months) represents a moderately tight but not unreasonable timeframe for recall closure. Factors supporting closure: The recall involves only 22,000 pounds, which is relatively small in scale; foreign matter contamination may be simpler to address than bacterial contamination; and companies are typically motivated to resolve recalls quickly. Factors against closure: The recall has already been active for over a month with no indication of imminent closure; USDA/FSIS recall closure requires thorough verification that all affected product has been removed from commerce and that effective corrective actions are in place; many food recalls remain open for 3-6 months or longer. Without specific information about Johnsonville's progress on corrective actions or FSIS verification activities, I must rely on base rates for similar recalls. The fact that 34 days have elapsed without closure suggests this may be following a standard timeline rather than an expedited one. Given the status quo bias (recalls remain active unless actively closed), the lack of information about progress, and typical recall durations, I estimate a moderate but below-even probability. My forecast would be higher if there were reports of imminent corrective action completion or FSIS verification activities nearing completion. It would be lower if the recall scope expanded or if additional complications were reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
