  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The harmonized tariff schedule will continue to list the 31% tariff rate for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60, marked as suspended, resulting in a YES outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. administration removes the tariff entry from the HTS entirely before June 1, or changes the rate to something other than 31%, possibly as a result of early conclusion of negotiations with Switzerland or a policy reversal",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS continues to list the 31% rate for Switzerland on June 1, regardless of whether it remains suspended. Since the 90-day suspension runs until July 9, the existing listing would simply remain in place through June 1",
    "rationale": "The critical detail is that the resolution criteria explicitly states that 'whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.' Currently, the HTS lists a 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products under subheading 9903.01.60, marked as suspended. The suspension period runs from April 10 through July 9, 2025, which fully encompasses the June 1 resolution date. Given that the status quo is that the 31% rate is already actively listed in the HTS (albeit suspended), and the suspension period extends well beyond June 1, the most likely outcome is that nothing changes before the resolution date. For a NO outcome, the administration would need to proactively remove or modify this HTS entry before June 1, which seems unlikely given: (1) the suspension was just announced on April 10, only 2 weeks ago; (2) the stated purpose is to allow time for negotiations, which typically take months; (3) governments generally move slowly on such changes; and (4) there's no indication of plans for early modification. The primary risk to a YES outcome would be an unexpectedly rapid conclusion to negotiations or a sudden policy reversal, but with 38 days remaining and ongoing negotiations, maintaining the current HTS listing (even if suspended) is the path of least resistance. I would increase my forecast if there were signs of imminent negotiations conclusion or policy changes, and decrease it if the administration explicitly announced plans to maintain the suspension status through its full term without modification to the HTS listing itself.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
