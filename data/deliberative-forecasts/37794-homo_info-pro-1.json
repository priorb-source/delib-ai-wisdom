    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable perspectives. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrored my own, focusing on the tension between strong regression to the mean and the very short timeframe, which gives me confidence in my core model of the problem. Forecaster 2's analysis operated from a different factual premise—that no player was currently at .400—which is inconsistent with the information I was provided about Aaron Judge. This discrepancy makes their low 15% forecast difficult to directly integrate. However, Forecaster 2 made an excellent point I had not fully considered: a 'Yes' outcome could occur via a player with very few at-bats, such as a recently called-up prospect, as the resolution criteria do not specify a minimum number of plate appearances.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast from 35% to 40%. My initial rationale remains the primary driver of my forecast: Aaron Judge is currently over the .400 threshold, but statistical regression over the remaining ~12 games makes it more likely than not that his average will drop below that mark. However, the deliberation raised two points that warrant an upward adjustment. First, Forecaster 3's similar reasoning resulted in a slightly higher probability, which suggests my initial forecast may have been too conservative about the chances of a superstar maintaining a hot streak over a short two-week period. Second, Forecaster 2 introduced a valid, albeit low-probability, alternative path to a 'Yes' outcome through an unqualified batter (e.g., a prospect on a hot start). This new scenario, while unlikely on its own, adds a few percentage points of possibility to the 'Yes' side. Therefore, I'm adjusting my forecast up by 5 percentage points to account for these factors.",
