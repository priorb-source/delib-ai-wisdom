  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (until June 30, 2025, since the question is “before July 1”).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the closures remain in place through June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security operations persist along the Benin–Nigeria frontier, with Benin citing ongoing risks from arms smuggling and the ‘Mahmuda’ group. No bilateral deal materializes, and authorities prefer to keep the Taberu–Tanu and other Kwara crossings shut pending further assessments. No credible report of reopening appears before June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Nigerian–Beninese talks in early-to-mid June yield a compromise: controlled or partial reopening of the Kwara crossings (e.g., Taberu–Tanu) with tighter checks and joint patrols. Benin’s government or reputable media report gates reopened and traffic resuming under new protocols before June 30.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Security-motivated border closures in ECOWAS are often protracted. The assistant’s review of 15 cases since 2015 suggests only about 20% reopen within 60 days, with faster reopenings more typical for purely commercial/administrative closures. Our window here is roughly 53 days from the early-May closure to June 30, so the raw base rate is already modest.\n\nCurrent signals lean against a quick reopening. The reported reasons include arms smuggling and an emergent militant group (‘Mahmuda’), and on May 30 an AFRICOM briefing flagged a deteriorating threat environment along the Benin–Nigeria frontier. As of late May there were no public indications from Cotonou or Abuja that reopening was imminent, and Benin reportedly extended security measures to additional border areas (e.g., Sèmè/Owode), suggesting a broadening of concern rather than de-escalation. These factors push the probability below the 60‑day base rate.\n\nCountervailing pressures exist. The Nigerian House of Representatives urged engagement on May 14, and seasonal trade disruptions affect livelihoods in border communities, creating incentives to restore controlled flows. The closure is geographically specific (Kwara crossings), which might allow for a targeted, conditions-based reopening if both sides agree to enhanced screening and joint patrols. Such a pathway keeps the probability from falling too low.\n\nWhy not higher: Security-driven closures rarely reverse within a month, and recent signals point to caution rather than relaxation. We also need credible reporting of reopening before June 30, further reducing odds.\n\nWhy not lower: The crossing(s) are economically salient to local communities; a partial, monitored reopening is feasible if talks progress and Benin judges the near-term threat manageable.\n\nWhat would move me up: A joint communiqué announcing imminent reopening steps; reports of successful interdictions and a declared reduction in threat; ECOWAS-facilitated security coordination; visible reopening at adjacent crossings. What would move me down: New attacks or arms seizures linked to the corridor; official statements extending or tightening closures; reports of spillover violence in northern Benin or adjacent Nigerian areas.\n",
