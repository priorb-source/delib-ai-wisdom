    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 both correctly identify the strong status quo and short timeline as key factors supporting a 'Yes' resolution. Forecaster 2's reasoning for a significantly lower forecast of 87% seems to rely on an assumption of 'significant NOAA cuts including mass layoffs,' which is not supported by the evidence provided to me; my evidence is a specific NOAA statement refuting service interruptions. Therefore, I find their forecast unconvincingly low. Forecaster 3 provides a more nuanced and convincing analysis. Their two key points were highly influential: 1) The example of another database being 'archived' rather than taken offline provides a strong model for how the administration handles data curation, which reduces the risk of a complete shutdown. 2) They explicitly identified the technical tail risk associated with the resolution criteria (a momentary outage or a failure of the checking tool at the precise time of resolution), which is a concrete failure path I had not adequately considered.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast slightly downward from 98% to 96%. My initial forecast was based heavily on the explicit NOAA statement guaranteeing service continuity, which I still consider the most important piece of evidence. The input from the other forecasters caused me to refine my thinking in two opposing directions. On one hand, Forecaster 3's point about the practice of archiving data rather than deleting domains strengthens my belief that a politically motivated shutdown is extremely unlikely, pushing my estimate upwards. On the other hand, Forecaster 3's excellent point about the non-political technical risks—a transient outage, a TLS certificate lapse, or an issue with the specific IsItDownRightNow monitoring tool at the moment of resolution—is a concrete failure mode I had previously bundled into a generic 'black swan' category. I now believe this mundane technical risk is more probable than the political risk and accounts for most of the remaining uncertainty. I am lowering my forecast by 2 percentage points to better reflect this specific, non-zero technical risk, which I now estimate at around 3%, while keeping the probability of a deliberate policy reversal at around 1%.",
