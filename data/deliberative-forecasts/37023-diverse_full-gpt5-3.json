    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize momentum, breadth of weakness, and the unusually high inflation expectations (6.7%)—all consistent with persistent downside pressure. Their point that “absence of new bad news is insufficient” is a useful correction to my prior weighting of mean reversion. They also stress that tariff pass-through is an ongoing process, not a one-off shock, which likely keeps sentiment headwinds in place through early/mid-May. I didn’t see materially new datapoints beyond what I had, but their calibration toward the low- to mid-20s highlights that I likely over-weighted noise/mean-reversion given how extreme the drivers are and how salient they are to consumers.",
    "rationale": "I’m nudging my probability down to reflect stronger persistence of the drivers: inflation expectations at a multi-decade high, rising unemployment fears, and visible price hikes linked to tariffs. These tend to depress sentiment for more than a single month, and the April drop was broad-based across demographics, suggesting stickiness. The bar to beat (just >50.8) is low, and month-to-month volatility/partial mean reversion still matters, so I won’t go as low as 25%. But with continued policy/price uncertainty and limited time for a clear positive catalyst before the preliminary May release, the balance of probabilities tilts to No. Update from 41% to 33% to better reflect momentum and catalyst asymmetry while retaining some weight on a small technical bounce.",
