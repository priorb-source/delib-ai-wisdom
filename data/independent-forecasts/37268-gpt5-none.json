    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 59 days (≈2 months) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Sadrist movement maintains its boycott posture and makes no announcement to field candidates before July 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sadr continues to signal rejection of the electoral process (as he did for the 2023 provincial elections and in later statements), keeps political offices dormant, and allows filing deadlines to approach without an explicit participation announcement. Any re-entry decision is deferred until after July 1 or tied to contingencies not yet met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sadr executes a late reversal, announcing that his movement (under any label consistent with the Saairun/Sadrist brand) will field candidates, possibly after extracting concessions on election administration or law, capitalizing on a political opening, or responding to intra-Shia rival fractures. Announcement could come via Sadr’s official channels or senior aides and be picked up by Iraqi media and IHEC-related steps.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: There are roughly two months left. If the 2025 vote is slated for late 2025, Sadr could, in principle, wait beyond July 1 to announce, as he did in 2021 (withdrew, then reversed about two months before the October election). That timing pattern makes an announcement before July 1 less likely even if eventual participation is plausible.\n- Status quo: Since 2022 Sadr has removed his bloc from parliament and has repeatedly reaffirmed election boycotts, including rejecting appeals to participate (per the BasNews headline cited). He also boycotted the December 2023 provincial elections. With no fresh indications of reactivation, the default is continued boycott through July 1.\n- Reasons for a potential reversal: Sadr is highly tactical and has a precedent of abrupt U-turns (2021). If he perceives a favorable shift—e.g., an election-law tweak, a credible deal limiting rival dominance, public momentum he can harness, or fissures within the Coordination Framework—he could announce quickly and mobilize candidates on short notice.\n- Why not higher: The combination of (a) a short window, (b) consistent boycott signaling since 2022, and (c) his 2021 timing pattern (late re-entry closer to the vote) weighs against a pre–July 1 announcement.\n- Why not lower: Sadr’s capacity for rapid, dramatic course changes is well-documented; he can re-enter without long lead times, and the resolution counts any Sadr-led vehicle (name changes do not affect resolution).\n- What would move me up: Credible Iraqi media quoting senior Sadr aides about participation; reopening/activating Sadrist political offices; visible coordination with IHEC or candidate vetting; public rapprochement with former Saairun allies; signs of an imminent deal on election rules.\n- What would move me down: A fresh categorical boycott statement from Sadr; missed or closed candidate-registration milestones with no Sadrist activity; escalating security tensions that make participation less attractive.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was provided; forecast leans on known historical behavior and current public stance.\n",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
