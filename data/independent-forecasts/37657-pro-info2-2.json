  "information": "As of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Global health surveillance systems continue their operations without detecting any human cases of HKU5-CoV-2. The virus remains confined to its animal reservoir, or any isolated spillover events that might occur are not detected and reported by credible global health organizations before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover event occurs, infecting at least one person. Due to post-COVID enhanced surveillance protocols, such as the metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases, the novel virus is identified in a human sample and subsequently reported by a major health body like the WHO or CDC.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence of the status quo and the short time remaining until the resolution date. The research report confirms that, as of today, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been detected despite enhanced global surveillance systems. Zoonotic spillover events are, by nature, exceedingly rare for any specific virus. The probability of such a specific, rare event occurring and being detected and reported by credible sources within the next 45 days is very low. My forecast is not lower than 2% because these enhanced surveillance systems significantly increase the probability of *detecting* a case if a spillover were to happen, compared to the pre-2020 era. A single reported case is all that is needed to resolve this question as 'Yes.' My forecast is not higher because the 45-day timeframe is extremely restrictive. For a 'Yes' outcome, a chain of low-probability events must occur consecutively: a spillover, symptoms severe enough to warrant testing, sample sequencing, identification, and official reporting by a credible source. The likelihood of this entire cascade completing before the deadline is minimal. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of an unusual cluster of respiratory illness in a relevant geographic area. I would lower it as the deadline approaches with no such signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
