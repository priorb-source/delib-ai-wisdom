    "review": "My initial analysis was critically flawed. I incorrectly dismissed the primary evidence provided—the AP article—and assumed the 50% tariff figure was a misinterpretation of the 25% steel tariffs. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 correctly based their analysis on the premise that the anomalous 50% tariff listing for Lesotho is the factual status quo. Their reasoning, centered on bureaucratic inertia and the short timeframe for change, is compelling. Forecaster 3 provided an exceptionally valuable insight that I had missed: the resolution criteria stipulating that a 'suspended' status still resolves as 'Yes'. This significantly strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome, as suspension is often an easier administrative action than outright textual removal from a legal document like the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Their analyses have convinced me to completely re-evaluate my position.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast from 1% to 80%. My initial forecast was based on the incorrect assumption that the 50% tariff did not exist and would need to be created. Based on the deliberation, I now accept the core premise shared by the other forecasters: an erroneous 50% tariff for Lesotho is currently listed in the HTS, as detailed in the 2020 AP article.\n\nThe key question is therefore not whether a tariff will be added, but whether this long-standing error will be removed within the next five weeks. The arguments for the listing persisting are very strong:\n\n1.  **Bureaucratic Inertia:** The fact that this error has existed for over four years since the AP article highlighted it is powerful evidence that the U.S. government process for correcting the HTS is slow and that this issue is of low priority.\n2.  **Short Timeframe:** Five weeks is a very short period to expect a legal document like the HTS to be formally amended, published (e.g., in the Federal Register), and updated in the live online schedule.\n3.  **Resolution Criteria:** Forecaster 3's point is critical. The easiest and most likely administrative 'fix' would be to issue a notice suspending the application of the tariff. However, per the resolution criteria, if the text listing the '+ 50%' duty remains in the subheading—even if marked 'suspended'—the question resolves 'Yes'. This creates a high bar for a 'No' resolution, which would require the complete removal of the text.\n\nI am setting my forecast at 80%, not higher, to account for the possibility that a correction process is already underway or that the (hypothetical) renewed attention on this issue could expedite a technical correction before June 1. However, the combination of powerful inertia and the specific resolution criteria makes the persistence of the listing the most likely outcome.",
