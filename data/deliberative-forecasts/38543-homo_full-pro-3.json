    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the extreme logistical difficulty and short timeframe as the primary drivers for a low probability. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own original reasoning. However, Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial points I had not sufficiently weighed: 1) President Xi Jinping's own international travel schedule (a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18), which further constricts an already narrow window for a meeting, and 2) the interpretation of the diplomatic language 'date and location to be announced later' as strong positive evidence that a meeting is *not* imminent. This reasoning is highly convincing, as it adds specific, concrete obstacles to the general logistical concerns.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward based on the compelling arguments made by Forecaster 3. My initial 10% probability did not adequately account for President Xi's conflicting schedule. With both leaders occupied with international summits until June 18th, the window for a visit to China before July 1st becomes vanishingly small. Furthermore, the argument that the official announcement's language actively signals a *non-imminent* meeting is a strong counterpoint to the possibility of a surprise visit. While the political incentive to sign a trade deal before the July tariff deadline exists, and Trump's penchant for unconventional diplomacy remains a factor, the combined logistical and scheduling impossibilities are more severe than I first assessed. These new constraints make the 'Yes' scenario substantially less likely. Therefore, I am significantly reducing my forecast from 10% to 3% to reflect this heightened improbability.",
