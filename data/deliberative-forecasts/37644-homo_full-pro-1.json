    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are in strong alignment with my own, creating a solid consensus. We all identify the same key drivers for a 'No' outcome: Anthropic's ample private funding, the extremely short timeframe until the resolution date, and the complete absence of typical pre-IPO signals like media leaks about hiring underwriters. Forecaster 3 made a useful point by explicitly highlighting that the resolution only requires an *announcement*, not the IPO itself, which technically lowers the bar for a 'Yes' resolution. However, I believe this was an implicit consideration in my original 'surprise scenario' analysis. The reasoning from both forecasters is highly convincing and serves primarily to reinforce my confidence in the initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert forecasts, I am maintaining my initial probability. The arguments presented strongly reinforce my original reasoning rather than challenging it. The core factors remain unchanged: \n1) **Capital-Rich:** Anthropic recently raised substantial funds and has access to billions more from strategic partners like Amazon and Google, eliminating any urgent financial need to go public.\n2) **Short Timeline:** With only about six weeks until July 1, 2025, the window for a company of this scale to complete the necessary preparations and make an announcement is vanishingly small. \n3) **No Signals:** There is a complete lack of public evidence or credible leaks to financial media that any IPO preparations are underway. This absence of signals is the most compelling piece of evidence. \nWhile Forecaster 3's point about the low resolution bar (announcement only) is valid, my 2% forecast was already predicated on this being the only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. A surprise S-1 filing announcement is the primary scenario that could lead to a 'Yes' resolution, and I believe my 2% estimate accurately reflects the low, but non-zero, probability of such an event occurring in secrecy and being announced within the given timeframe. The consensus reinforces my view that an IPO announcement is a very low probability event.",
