  "information": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' or another status other than 'complete', resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Project 2025 Tracker continues to mark the objective as 'in progress' or changes it to another non-complete status when checked on July 1, 2025. This occurs because the CPB lawsuit continues, Congressional appropriations protect funding through September 30, 2027, and the maintainers don't consider the executive order alone sufficient to mark the objective as complete without actual cessation of funding.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The spreadsheet marks the objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025. This could occur if the Tracker maintainers decide the executive order itself satisfies their completion criteria regardless of actual funding status, or if there's an unexpectedly rapid legal resolution that actually stops the funding flow, or if the maintainers interpret some interim action as sufficiently completing the objective.",
    "rationale": "The baseline strongly favors No resolution. The objective is currently marked 'in progress' despite an executive order already being issued, suggesting the maintainers are waiting for actual implementation rather than just policy declarations. My research assistant notes that CPB has $535 million allocated through September 30, 2027 via Congressional appropriation, and has filed a lawsuit asserting it's a private nonprofit not subject to executive control. With only 6 weeks until the resolution date, there's insufficient time for: (1) the lawsuit to be fully resolved, (2) Congressional funding to be actually stopped, or (3) a clear defunding action that the maintainers would recognize as 'complete.' The key uncertainty is the Tracker maintainers' completion criteria. If they require actual cessation of funding, that's nearly impossible in 6 weeks given legal and Congressional protections. If they accept the executive order as sufficient, they would likely have already marked it complete. The fact they haven't suggests a higher bar. I'm not going lower because there's some chance the maintainers could proactively change their criteria or interpret developments more broadly. I'm not going higher because the legal, Congressional, and temporal barriers to actual defunding in 6 weeks are substantial, and the current 'in progress' status indicates the maintainers are waiting for concrete implementation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
