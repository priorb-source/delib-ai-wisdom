    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 15, 2025, the Starlink Availability Map does not list any part of Somalia as \"Available.\" The current status is the equivalent of a waitlist or pending service.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The existing regulatory, logistical, or ground-infrastructure hurdles that have prevented the service from launching since the license was announced in late 2023 are not resolved by the deadline. SpaceX keeps Somalia's status as pending, and the map is not updated to \"Available\" before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX completes the final steps for service activation in Somalia, which could include ground station deployment and final operational approvals. The company updates its official availability map to show Somalia as \"Available\" in a last-minute push before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily influenced by the conflict between a strong signal of intent and the significant passage of time. The key positive indicator is the official announcement in November 2023 that Starlink secured a license for Somalia. This typically precedes a service launch. However, the status quo is a powerful force, and over 18 months have passed since that announcement without the service going live. This long delay, despite the initial approval, suggests that non-trivial obstacles remain. With only 47 days left until the deadline, the probability of resolving these issues decreases with each passing day. My probability is not lower than 35% because securing the license is a major milestone, and SpaceX is known for activating services in new countries with little advance notice. The technical and logistical groundwork might be nearly complete, pending a final green light. My probability is not higher than 35% because the extended delay is a strong negative signal. If the rollout were straightforward, it would likely be active by now. The most probable explanation for the current situation is a persistent issue that is unlikely to be resolved within the short remaining timeframe. To update my forecast higher, I would look for tangible signs of an imminent launch, such as shipping confirmations for Starlink kits to Somalia or reports of active ground stations. To update lower, I would look for official statements from either SpaceX or the Somali government indicating further delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
