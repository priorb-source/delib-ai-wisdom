    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10 days (election May 1, results likely by May 2, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party on Kent County Council (possibly with no overall control), i.e., Reform UK does not win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK polls well but splits the right-leaning vote with Conservatives. Labour, Lib Dems, and Greens pick up divisions where the right is divided, while Conservatives still top the seat count thanks to incumbency, better candidate coverage, and vote efficiency. Result: Conservatives largest; council possibly under no overall control.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform fields a near-full slate of candidates and converts strong coastal and small-town support (e.g., Thanet, Dover, Swale, Folkestone & Hythe, parts of Gravesham/Shepway) into a plurality of first-place finishes. Conservative vote collapses uniformly, Labour underperforms outside core urban areas (and Medway isn’t in KCC), turnout skews toward Reform-leaning voters, and tactical anti-Tory voting doesn’t coalesce against Reform. Result: Reform wins the most seats.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Kent County Council has long been Conservative-led and, absent Medway (a Labour-leaning unitary authority not part of KCC), the geography structurally favors Conservatives or at least keeps Labour from easily becoming largest. In 2021 the Conservatives held a large majority. Even with the post-2024 Conservative slump and Reform’s national rise, flipping the largest-party status to Reform in a first-past-the-post county contest within one cycle is a high bar.\n\nKey considerations:\n- First-past-the-post dynamics: Reform’s vote share tends to be inefficiently distributed and often produces many seconds rather than wins. A split right can hand seats to Labour/Lib Dems rather than to Reform, making it harder for Reform to top the seat tally even if they score high votes.\n- Organization and incumbency: Conservatives, Labour, and Lib Dems have deeper local infrastructures, incumbents, and name recognition. Reform’s local ground game and councillor base remain limited, which typically depresses seat conversion in local elections.\n- Candidate coverage constraint: If Reform does not field candidates in all (or nearly all) divisions, their ceiling for seats is capped below what’s needed to be largest.\n- Geography: Kent outside Medway contains many Conservative-inclined rural and suburban divisions. Labour is competitive in some towns (e.g., Canterbury city, coastal urban pockets), but its strength is less efficiently spread for county divisions. This backdrop favors a Conservative plurality or a fragmented NOC more than a Reform plurality.\n- Poll/story weight: The cited KentOnline piece referencing an Electoral Calculus projection indicating Reform could take control increases the upper tail risk but is a single-source model-based signal. MRP/model-based local projections can overstate new-party seat wins where local organization and incumbency effects are strong. I treat it as a reason not to put the probability near-zero, but still low.\n\nWhy not higher: Structural FPTP hurdles, organizational deficits for Reform, and the historical baseline all work against them becoming the largest party within weeks. Why not lower: Kent has demographics favorable to Reform (Brexit-leaning coastal areas), national polls place Reform in high-teens/low-20s and sometimes higher in the South East, and a Conservative collapse could create an unusual path for Reform to top the seat count if they have a full slate and concentrated strength in key divisions.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that Reform is running a near-full slate across KCC; reputable local polling or ward-level evidence showing Reform leading in many divisions; visible ground operation momentum; signs of very low Conservative turnout and limited tactical coalescence for Labour/Lib Dems. What would move me down: Evidence of incomplete Reform slates; local polling showing Conservatives (or Labour) clearly ahead in seat-rich areas; reports of strong tactical voting against Reform; indications that Reform’s support is broad-but-thin rather than concentrated in winnable divisions.\n\nResearch assistant input: None beyond the provided article reference; therefore I weight structural priors and known electoral dynamics more heavily.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
