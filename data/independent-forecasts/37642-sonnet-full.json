  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. The outcome will be determined by any FOMC announcements made before that date, with likely one scheduled FOMC meeting in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate range through June 2025, continuing its patient approach as officials have indicated they are 'not in a hurry' to cut rates.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed holds rates steady at its June FOMC meeting, citing persistent inflation at 2.7% (above the 2% target), strong labor market conditions with 4.2% unemployment, and their stated need to see 'more consistent improvement' in inflation before beginning an easing cycle. This aligns with the current consensus among major financial institutions projecting the first cut in July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected economic shock occurs, such as a sudden financial market crisis, sharp deterioration in economic data, or faster-than-expected disinflation, prompting the Fed to cut rates at an emergency meeting or at the June FOMC meeting. Alternatively, Chair Powell signals a shift in stance at the June meeting with an immediate rate reduction.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no rate cut before July 1. Multiple factors support this: (1) Fed officials have explicitly stated they are 'not in a hurry' and will take a 'wait-and-see' approach, (2) major institutions have pushed back rate cut expectations - Goldman Sachs now forecasts December, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley project July, (3) the CME FedWatch tool shows low probability for a June cut with market participants viewing September or later as more probable, (4) current economic conditions don't urgently demand cuts - inflation remains elevated at 2.7% above the Fed's 2% target and the labor market remains strong with 4.2% unemployment. With only approximately 6.5 weeks remaining and likely just one FOMC meeting scheduled before the deadline, there is limited opportunity for a rate cut announcement. The Fed's March 2025 projection of two cuts during the year didn't specify early timing. My forecast is not higher (closer to certainty of No) because unexpected economic shocks can occur, and the Fed could theoretically make an emergency cut if conditions deteriorate rapidly. However, such scenarios historically are rare. My forecast is not lower (closer to Yes) because all available evidence points decisively toward July or later: explicit Fed communication, consensus institutional forecasts, market pricing, and economic fundamentals all support continued patience. For me to increase the probability significantly, I would need to see: a sudden spike in unemployment, a sharp unexpected drop in inflation, financial market stress signals, or explicit Fed communication of an imminent policy shift. For me to decrease it further, I would need more explicit Fed guidance ruling out June action, though the current messaging already strongly suggests this.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
