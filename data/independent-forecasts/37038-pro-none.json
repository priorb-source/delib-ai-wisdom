    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The United States and Israel have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has been in effect since 1985, making most goods traded between them duty-free. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule does not currently list a 17% tariff for Israel.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US-Israel Free Trade Agreement remains in effect without major changes. The US administration, despite any political disagreements, does not take the significant and rapid executive or legislative action needed to impose a broad 17% tariff on Israeli goods by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration takes a drastic and unprecedented step, likely via an executive order citing national security or foreign policy reasons, to unilaterally impose a 17% tariff on a wide range of Israeli goods. This action is implemented quickly and reflected in the official tariff schedule by June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong inertia of existing US trade policy. The US-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is a long-standing, congressionally-approved agreement that forms a cornerstone of the bilateral economic relationship. Overriding or suspending such an agreement would be a major diplomatic and economic step with significant political and legal hurdles. The status quo is that Israeli goods are generally duty-free, making 'No' the strong default outcome. The resolution date is just over a month away, which is an extremely short time frame for such a substantial change in trade policy to be debated, enacted, and implemented. While the provided article from over a year ago indicates that tariffs have been a topic of discussion due to political tensions, and friction between the two governments has persisted, a broad 17% tariff would be a radical escalation. Such a move would face intense opposition within the US from various political and business Caucuses. My probability is not lower than 3% because the current political climate is volatile, and the possibility of an unforeseen executive action in response to events in the Middle East cannot be entirely dismissed. However, the probability is not higher because there is no current, public evidence of an active proposal, draft legislation, or executive order to implement this specific 17% tariff. I would raise my forecast if credible reports emerged of a specific executive order being drafted or key administration officials publicly advocating for this measure. Conversely, I would lower it if senior officials explicitly reaffirm the FTA's status before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
