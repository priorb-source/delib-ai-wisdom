    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial forecast. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I had not fully considered: the resolution mechanics strongly favor the S-1 filing path over a blog announcement. Companies rarely pre-announce IPO plans on their website due to quiet period regulations and SEC restrictions. This effectively means we're forecasting a surprise S-1 filing within 40 days with zero current signals - a narrower and less likely scenario than I initially modeled. Forecaster 3's seasonality observation is also well-taken: late spring/early summer is not prime IPO season, with fall windows being more typical. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'complete lack of affirmative evidence' is stark and important - we have literally no signals that would typically precede an IPO announcement (no banker rumors, no confidential filing reports, no leadership hints). All three of us cluster between 5-9%, suggesting broad consensus on the low probability. The main disagreement is whether to weight the theoretical possibility (mature company could move quickly, improved IPO market) more heavily versus the practical reality (no signals, poor timing, narrow resolution path).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast downward from 8% to 6%. The key driver of this update is Forecaster 3's insight about resolution mechanics - the blog announcement path is practically unrealistic due to quiet period considerations, meaning we're really forecasting only an S-1 filing within 40 days. This narrows the viable scenario significantly. Combined with the seasonality concerns (summer is not prime IPO season) and the complete absence of any preparatory signals that typically precede IPO announcements (leaked banker mandates, confidential filing reports, executive statements), the probability should be lower than my initial estimate. I'm not going as low as 5% because: (1) the IPO market has improved relative to 2022-2023, making the window more viable than in recent years, (2) Rippling is a mature, scaled company that theoretically could have been preparing quietly, and (3) 40 days, while short, is technically sufficient for a well-prepared company to file an S-1. However, the weight of evidence - or rather, the complete lack thereof - combined with the structural constraints identified by the other forecasters justifies moving down to 6%.",
