    "review": "All three of us converged on remarkably similar analyses despite working independently, landing in a narrow 30-45% range. This convergence is reassuring and suggests our uncertainty quantification is well-calibrated given the severe information constraints. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'status quo principle' - being cautious about predicting wins without evidence - is a valid epistemic stance that I hadn't explicitly articulated. Forecaster 3's observation about Jones having Wikipedia coverage and warranting WaPo attention as credibility signals is also reasonable. However, none of us provided new hard information about the race dynamics, polling, or competitive field. We're all essentially reasoning from the same minimal priors: Jones is a credible former elected official actively campaigning, but we have no information about his relative strength versus opponents. The base rate reasoning (25-50% depending on field size of 2-4 candidates) that Forecaster 3 articulated is sound, though we don't know the actual field size. The differences in our forecasts (30% vs 40% vs 45%) reflect slightly different weightings of the same uncertainty rather than fundamentally different analyses.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' reasoning, I'm slightly adjusting my forecast downward from 40% to 38%. This reflects giving more weight to Forecaster 2's status quo principle - without evidence that Jones is the frontrunner (polling, endorsements, news of momentum), I should be marginally more conservative about predicting his victory. However, I'm not moving all the way to 30% because Jones's credibility signals (former delegate, active campaign, WaPo coverage) still justify staying in the middle of our collective 30-45% range. The narrow spread across all three forecasts suggests we've appropriately bounded the uncertainty. In an information vacuum with 14 days until voting, assuming a multi-candidate field where Jones is credible but not demonstrably leading, 38% balances acknowledging his viability while respecting that we lack evidence he's the favorite. This would increase substantially with any polling showing him ahead or information about a weak field, and would decrease with evidence of strong opposition or poor positioning.",
