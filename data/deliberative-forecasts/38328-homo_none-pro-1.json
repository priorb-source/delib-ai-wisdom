    "review": "The other two forecasters both arrived at a similar probability range (30-35%), substantially lower than my initial 55%. Their reasoning was convergent, focusing on two key points I had underweighted: 1) The strong tendency for politicians to resist resignation and attempt to 'ride out' scandals, and 2) The very narrow 22-day resolution window, which makes a forced resignation less likely as investigative and political processes often take longer. I found their arguments convincing, particularly the emphasis on the short timeframe. They correctly pointed out that even a potent scandal might not lead to a resignation within this specific, brief period. Their analysis effectively challenged my assumption that the scandal would force a quick resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast down significantly from 55% to 40%. Their arguments have convinced me that my initial assessment was too aggressive. I had overweighted the catalytic effect of the scandal and the 'clean slate' post-election timing, while underestimating the powerful inertia that protects incumbent politicians and the high probability that any resolution would fall outside the very narrow 22-day window. While I still believe the post-election timing creates a uniquely potent pressure point for a party to force out a damaged member (which is why my forecast remains slightly higher than the 30-35% of my peers), I now agree that the 'No' outcome is the more probable one. The combination of a low base rate for resignations and the common political strategy of delaying and weathering storms makes it more likely than not that any implicated MEP will either hold on to their post past the July 1 deadline or that the process to remove them will take longer to unfold.",
