    "review": "The convergence of all three forecasts to 12-15% is striking and reinforces confidence in this range. Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 raised some valuable framing points I hadn't explicitly emphasized. Forecaster 3's observation that 'intermeeting cuts are rare absent acute stress' is particularly important - it underscores that we effectively have only one decision point (June 17-18 FOMC), not multiple opportunities. Forecaster 2's emphasis on 'inertia in monetary policy' nicely captures the institutional momentum working against a June cut. Both forecasters helpfully identified specific data releases (May CPI, jobs reports) and thresholds (unemployment rising to 4.4%+, widening credit spreads) that would trigger updates. However, none of the forecasters presented fundamentally new evidence or arguments that materially changes the analysis. We all identified the same core constraints: limited time, explicit Fed patience, institutional consensus pointing to July or later, and current economic conditions not warranting urgency. The fact that three independent analyses converged so tightly (12%, 12%, 15%) actually increases my confidence that this range is well-calibrated rather than suggesting I should update significantly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I remain convinced that 12% is the appropriate forecast. The convergence of three independent forecasters to 12-15% validates the reasoning framework. The key factors remain unchanged: (1) Only one FOMC meeting before July 1st, with intermeeting cuts historically rare absent crisis conditions, (2) Explicit and consistent Fed communication emphasizing patience and a data-dependent approach, (3) Strong institutional consensus (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley) expecting July or later, (4) Current economic fundamentals - inflation at 2.7% above target and unemployment at 4.2% - do not scream urgency for easing, (5) Market pricing via CME FedWatch showing low probability for June. The 12% probability appropriately accounts for tail risks: unexpected economic deterioration, financial stress, or a dramatic shift in inflation data over the next month. But absent such shocks, the Fed's stated position and the institutional consensus make a pre-July cut unlikely. I see no compelling reason to adjust from my initial 12% forecast.",
