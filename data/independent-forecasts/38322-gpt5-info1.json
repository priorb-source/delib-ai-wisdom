  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until Fri, Jun 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — May final was 52.2, below 54.0, so carrying forward implies <54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A modest rebound in June sentiment (≥54.0), driven by a benign May CPI print (released Jun 12), easing gasoline prices, a solid June payrolls report/stock market strength, and improved inflation expectations in the late-month sample pushing the final reading up by ~2+ points from May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Continued consumer caution tied to tariff/inflation worries, soft ISM readings, and high perceived prices keep sentiment depressed. The preliminary mid-June read prints near low-50s and the final stays sub-54 (typical revision only ±1–2 points).",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index fell to 52.2 in May (final), down notably from earlier 2025 levels. The research assistant also notes: May prelim was 50.8; the final improved to 52.2; Current Conditions slipped, Expectations barely improved; ISM services (49.9) and manufacturing (48.5) are soft. The Conference Board’s confidence rebounded to 98, but that survey often diverges from Michigan and has different sensitivities (jobs vs. prices).\n- Threshold math: To resolve No, June final must be ≥54.0. From May’s 52.2, that requires roughly a +1.8 point m/m gain—well within typical monthly volatility (often 2–4 points), but not automatic.\n- Baseline/status quo: World changes slowly; the most recent realized level is 52.2. With tariffs/inflation salience elevated and soft activity signals, the base case is that sentiment remains subdued. That argues for a Yes tilt (<54.0).\n- Countervailing forces: A cooling May CPI (Jun 12) and any visible easing in gas prices could lift inflation expectations and sentiment. Equity strength and a solid June jobs report could also nudge the index up a couple of points—enough to clear 54. The sharp rebound in the Conference Board survey hints at some upside risk.\n- Preliminary vs. final dynamics: Michigan’s preliminary mid-month read is a key leading signal; final revisions are usually small (±1–2 points). If prelim lands near/under 53, final <54 becomes quite likely. If prelim is 55+, the No outcome becomes favored.\n- Why not higher than ~62%: It doesn’t take a large move to reach 54.0, and there are plausible near-term catalysts for improvement (CPI, gas prices, stocks, jobs). Also, after sharp declines, sentiment sometimes mean-reverts.\n- Why not lower than ~62%: The latest hard/soft data skew cautious (ISM <50), tariff/inflation narratives remain prominent, and the most recent Michigan print is already below the threshold. The status quo deserves weight.\n- What would move me up (toward No): A benign May CPI and drop in gasoline prices; a strong jobs report and stock market rally; a June preliminary reading ≥55.\n- What would move me down (toward Yes): Hot CPI or renewed gas price pressure; weak labor data or market drawdown; a June preliminary at ≤53 (especially ≤52), given typically small final revisions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
