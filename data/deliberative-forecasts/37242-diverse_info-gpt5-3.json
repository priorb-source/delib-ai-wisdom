    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete evidence of spring 2025 seat growth (Jet2, Vueling, Air Nostrum +7–10%), which I hadn’t explicitly cited. That’s a strong, costly signal supporting a No outcome. Their downside points (protests, macro softness) are plausible but likely modest relative to capacity and seasonal tailwinds. Forecaster 3 introduces a new, specific negative shock: the April 28 power outage with several hundred flight cancellations. Their quantification (likely 1–2% impact on monthly arrivals) is reasonable and important. Both largely downplay the US-policy angle, which matches my view given the small US share. Neither fully leans into the Easter-in-April calendar shift as a major positive, which I consider a key driver toward No.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: April 2025 should be buoyed by the Easter calendar shift (in April 2025 vs. late March 2024), ongoing YoY momentum into Q1 (+3.6% for the quarter; Feb/Mar both +2.2% YoY), and airline capacity increases. These factors point to April 2025 ≥ April 2024. New information warrants a slight upward adjustment to the chance of a decline: the late-April power outage likely trimmed arrivals by roughly 1–2% of the monthly total, and high-profile protests may have had a small marginal effect. However, the Easter effect and added capacity likely outweigh these negatives. Net, I nudge my probability of a YoY decline up modestly from 15% to 18%, primarily to incorporate the outage risk now that the month has concluded.",
