    "no_outcome_scenario": "The underlying security and economic issues that led to the border closure are not resolved within the short, one-month timeframe. Diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria either do not occur or fail to produce a breakthrough. The government of Benin continues to prioritize its security concerns over the economic impact of the closure, and the border remains closed as of July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "High-level diplomatic intervention from Nigeria's federal government, possibly coupled with pressure from ECOWAS, leads to urgent negotiations. Nigeria offers concrete security cooperation to address Benin's concerns about the 'Mahmuda' group and arms smuggling. An agreement is reached, and in a gesture of goodwill and to alleviate economic pressure on local populations, Benin reopens the border crossings in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the assessment that the one-month timeframe until July 1, 2025, is exceptionally short for resolving the complex issues that prompted Benin to close its border. The status quo is that the border is closed, and significant diplomatic and security efforts would be needed to change this.\n\nThe reasons cited for the closure are severe: a new terror group, arms smuggling, and illegal exportation of agricultural products. Security-related border closures, especially those involving non-state armed groups, are typically not resolved quickly. They require intelligence sharing, coordinated military action, and confidence-building measures, processes that usually take months, not weeks. Historical precedents in the region, such as Nigeria's own extensive border closure from 2019-2021, demonstrate that such measures can be long-lasting.\n\nThe primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome would be intense diplomatic pressure and the economic pain felt by border communities, which could compel a faster resolution. Nigeria is a regional power, and Benin has an incentive to maintain a functional relationship. A swift, high-level agreement could override the on-the-ground realities.\n\nHowever, I am assigning a low probability because the security rationale provides a powerful justification for Benin to maintain the closure until it feels the threat has been tangibly addressed. The risk of terrorism and arms smuggling is likely to outweigh the short-term economic costs of the closure from the perspective of Benin's government.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% because a rapid political resolution, while difficult, is not impossible. The closure could be a form of political leverage by Benin to force Nigeria into action, and once that action is promised, the border could reopen quickly. I would raise my forecast significantly if there were credible reports of high-level talks between the presidents of both nations or joint security meetings taking place in the first half of June. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 20% because there is currently no information to suggest such a rapid resolution is underway. The default expectation for resolving a multi-faceted international border dispute involving a named security threat is a timeline stretching several months, far beyond the question's deadline. I would lower my forecast if there were reports of cross-border security incidents or if rhetoric from either government became more hostile.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
