  "information": "In January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months until July 1, 2025 (60 days from May 2, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No ban announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The most likely scenario is that either the motion fails to gain sufficient support in the Bundestag to proceed to the Federal Constitutional Court, or if it does proceed, the Constitutional Court does not complete its deliberations and issue a ban within the remaining 2-month timeframe. German party ban procedures historically take years, not months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bundestag votes to refer the case to the Federal Constitutional Court, which then accepts the case and conducts an extraordinarily expedited review process, ultimately announcing an official ban on the AfD before July 1, 2025. This would require an unprecedented acceleration of German constitutional procedures.",
    "rationale": "Based on the research assistant's report, a cross-party motion was submitted in January 2025 and debated on January 30, but reportedly lacked majority support with no immediate decisions expected. We are now in early May 2025 with only 2 months remaining until the resolution date. The critical constraint is time. German party ban procedures are deliberately thorough and slow - historically taking years to complete. Germany has only successfully banned two parties in its post-war history (1952 and 1956), and a previous attempt to ban the NPD took years before ultimately failing in 2017. The question requires an actual official announcement of a ban by the Federal Constitutional Court, not merely the initiation of proceedings. For a Yes outcome, the following would need to occur within 60 days: (1) the Bundestag would need to vote with sufficient majority to refer the case, (2) the Constitutional Court would need to accept it, and (3) the Court would need to complete its review and announce a ban. This timeline would be unprecedented in German constitutional law. Why not lower (1-2%): There is genuine cross-party support (124 lawmakers), constitutional law expert backing, and technically extraordinary circumstances could lead to accelerated procedures. Why not higher (8-10%+): The fundamental barrier is the 2-month timeframe combined with reports of lacking majority support, the absence of any news suggesting accelerated proceedings since January, and the strong historical precedent that these processes take years. An update toward higher probability would require evidence of: imminent Bundestag vote with likely majority support, or extraordinary political consensus to fast-track the process. An update toward lower probability would require: explicit rejection of the motion or statements from court officials about timeline impossibility.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
