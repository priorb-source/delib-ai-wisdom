    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint does not file for bankruptcy. The default outcome for any company is to continue operations, and corporate bankruptcies are relatively rare events, especially within such a short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues normal operations through July 1, 2025. The company manages its cash position adequately, maintains access to credit facilities, successfully negotiates with creditors if needed, or secures additional financing through equity raises, debt restructuring, or strategic partnerships. Even if facing financial challenges, they have sufficient liquidity to avoid an immediate bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint experiences a severe and rapid liquidity crisis over the next two months. Critical factors could include: inability to meet debt obligations, major customers defaulting or canceling contracts, key creditors demanding immediate repayment, failure to secure emergency financing, or discovery of accounting issues that spook investors and lenders. The company's board determines bankruptcy protection is the only viable option to restructure or wind down operations.",
    "rationale": "With approximately 57 days until the resolution date, this is an extremely short time horizon for forecasting a major corporate event like bankruptcy. The status quo strongly favors 'No' for several reasons: First, corporate bankruptcies are rare events with low base rates, particularly for publicly traded companies. Second, even companies in financial distress typically exhaust multiple alternatives (asset sales, debt renegotiation, emergency financing, strategic sales) before filing for bankruptcy protection. Third, the bankruptcy filing process itself usually involves considerable preparation and deliberation. My research assistant provided no additional information beyond the link to ChargePoint's Q4 and FY2025 financial results, which means I lack specific evidence of an imminent liquidity crisis, going concern warnings, or other acute distress signals. While ChargePoint operates in the competitive EV charging space and may face business challenges typical of growth-stage infrastructure companies, the absence of specific alarm signals and the extremely short time window strongly support a low probability. My forecast is not higher because there's no concrete evidence of imminent bankruptcy (no reported liquidity crisis, no news of covenant breaches, no going concern warnings mentioned). My forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because: (1) bankruptcy can occasionally happen quickly when liquidity crises emerge suddenly, (2) the specific framing of this question suggests some level of concern may exist, and (3) I maintain appropriate epistemic humility about unknown information. To revise upward, I would need evidence of: acute liquidity problems, debt defaults, going concern opinions, emergency board meetings, or creditor actions. To revise downward, I would need evidence of: successful refinancing, strong cash positions, or positive operational momentum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
