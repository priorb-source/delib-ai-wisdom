    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force and the Verkhovna Rada and Central Election Commission refrain from setting a presidential election date, citing legal prohibitions on holding elections during martial law and ongoing security concerns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kyiv signals a pathway to suspend or phase out martial law in some or all of the country and the Verkhovna Rada passes a resolution setting a specific election date (even if months away), or another competent authority (e.g., CEC) issues an official calendar once legally enabled. This could follow a ceasefire, major diplomatic development, or a political decision to placate legitimacy concerns.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/legal context: Ukrainian law prohibits conducting elections under martial law. Historically, Ukraine has repeatedly extended martial law in 90-day blocks during the full-scale invasion, and has deferred both parliamentary and presidential elections. Setting a date typically requires Verkhovna Rada action; the CEC then administers the process. While an announcement could, in theory, name a future date contingent on improved conditions, Kyiv has favored flexibility over committing to dates during active conflict.\n- Current environment (May 16, 2025): Hostilities remain significant and there has been no widely reported move to lift martial law nationwide. With only ~6 weeks left to July 1, the window for a legal/political pivot is short. The status quo, therefore, strongly points to no announcement by the deadline.\n- Political incentives: The government balances legitimacy pressures against operational/security constraints. International partners have largely accepted the wartime postponement. Announcing a date prematurely would create risks if conditions don’t permit implementation, so incentives tilt against a firm date absent a clear path to execution.\n- Why not higher: To get to a Yes, we would likely need a ceasefire or a credible plan to suspend martial law in areas sufficient to run a national vote, plus rapid legislative action. That seems unlikely on a 46‑day horizon.\n- Why not lower: A tail scenario exists in which Kyiv announces a future election date (e.g., late 2025/early 2026) to address domestic legitimacy debates or meet signaling needs to allies, even if martial law remains for now. A sudden diplomatic breakthrough could also catalyze a quick legislative move.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an impending ceasefire; official statements from Zelensky, Rada leadership, or the CEC indicating intent to schedule; draft legislation circulating to enable elections under/after martial law; EU/US conditionality explicitly tied to naming a date.\n- What would move me down: Renewed large‑scale offensives, new extensions of martial law with firm statements that elections won’t be scheduled until further notice, or legal/executive guidance reiterating that no date will be set under current conditions.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available beyond general background; thus I lean heavily on the legal-status-quo and observed wartime practice.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
