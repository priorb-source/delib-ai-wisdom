    "review": "Both forecasters largely track my priors: they emphasize the Kremlin’s April 4 and May 5 signals (no near‑term plans; need for preparation) as the main drag, and they note upside from prior calls and potential catalysts. Forecaster 3’s explicit “cadence” framing (two calls in ~5 weeks implying a moderate base rate for another within a 32‑day window) is a useful quant anchor I hadn’t quantified as clearly. Neither addressed the acknowledgment-by-both-sides requirement, which I still see as a mild downward adjustment versus a generic “call happens.” Overall, their arguments are convincing for keeping the forecast in the low-to-mid 30s: Kremlin messaging argues against imminence, but the channel is active and leader calls can be arranged quickly if a need emerges.",
    "rationale": "Netting the inputs: \n- Negative signals: Kremlin twice downplayed near-term principals’ contact and stressed preparatory work; no concrete planning evident a week before the window opens. Baseline remains “no planned call.” \n- Positive signals: Two acknowledged calls already this year indicate an open channel and willingness; the geopolitical agenda (Ukraine) can create urgency; Trump’s mid‑May Gulf trip and early‑June SPIEF provide timing hooks. A phone call requires far less prep than a summit, so the “preparation” line is weaker as a constraint for a call than for a meeting. \n- Acknowledgment requirement: Slightly lowers odds; if a sensitive call occurs, one side might avoid confirming. That said, both sides acknowledged earlier calls, so the penalty is modest. \n- Cadence/base rate: Forecaster 3’s cadence lens supports staying above 30% over a 32‑day window absent strong contrary evidence. \nBalancing these, I make a small upward nudge from my prior to reflect the cadence argument while still heeding Kremlin messaging and the acknowledgment constraint.",
