    "review": "Both other forecasters provided excellent, structured reasoning that largely aligns with my own initial thoughts, focusing on the short timeframe and the status quo of no cases in North America. However, they introduced two key, somewhat conflicting points regarding the threshold for a CDC advisory. Forecaster 2 argued that the CDC requires 'sustained risk,' not just isolated cases, which would push the probability lower. Conversely, Forecaster 3 made a very persuasive case that a single confirmed human case or even a significant epizootic (animal die-off) in a border region like the Darién could be sufficient to trigger a precautionary CDC 'Watch' (Level 1), which would satisfy the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3's specific mention of the Darién Gap as a high-risk corridor for introduction from Colombia into Panama was a crucial geographic detail I had not sufficiently weighted.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward based on the deliberation. Initially, I forecasted a 5% probability, believing a lengthy chain of events (introduction, sustained transmission, accumulation of cases, advisory) was necessary. However, Forecaster 3's analysis convinced me of a more plausible, faster pathway to a 'Yes' resolution. The argument that a single sentinel event—such as a confirmed human case or, critically, a yellow fever-related monkey die-off discovered in the Darién region of Panama—could trigger a precautionary Level 1 Travel Health Notice from the CDC is highly compelling. This lowers the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome significantly. The unprecedented scale of the outbreak in neighboring Colombia, combined with the known vulnerability of the Darién Gap migration corridor, makes such a sentinel event a more salient risk than I had first estimated. While Panama's public health response is strong, the very short distance and a plausible, faster trigger for a CDC notice warrant a higher probability. I am therefore increasing my forecast from 5% to 8%, aligning with Forecaster 2 and acknowledging the increased risk highlighted by Forecaster 3.",
