    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the reported Total Public Debt Outstanding stays below $37T by June 27, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The debt ceiling remains binding through late June, with Treasury using extraordinary measures that keep Total Public Debt Outstanding roughly flat near its early‑January level; even if a deal is imminent, there isn’t enough time or catch‑up issuance to reach $37T by June 27.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress raises/suspends the debt limit well before June 27. Treasury rapidly restores deferred intragovernmental investments and conducts catch‑up issuance, plus ongoing deficit financing, pushing Total Public Debt Outstanding to or above $37T by June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Only 23 days remain. Large changes in gross debt over such a short window usually require a debt‑limit resolution and immediate catch‑up issuance. \n- Status quo: The debt limit was reinstated at the start of 2025. When the limit binds, Treasury uses extraordinary measures that keep Total Public Debt Outstanding (the Debt to the Penny series) near the reinstatement level until Congress acts. Historically (e.g., 2011, 2013, 2023), this produces a flat line in the gross debt series for months. That makes a ≥$37T reading by June 27 unlikely unless Congress passes a debt‑limit bill soon. \n- Magnitude needed: Even if the ceiling were lifted in mid‑June, the immediate jump from restoring suspended intragovernmental investments plus a few weeks of issuance would plausibly be several hundred billion dollars, not a full $1T, unless the starting level were already very near $37T. Given typical headroom sizes and issuance pace, reaching ≥$37T by June 27 would require both timely legislative action and a starting point already within a few hundred billion of $37T. \n- Base rate and recent trend: Without a binding ceiling, gross debt has risen quickly in recent years; however, under an active ceiling the reported gross debt tends to stagnate until resolution. I put extra weight on this status quo dynamic. \n- Why not higher: Because the most probable near‑term path is continued use of extraordinary measures with no immediate legislative fix before late June, and even a mid‑to‑late June fix may not produce enough catch‑up to cross $37T by June 27. \n- Why not lower: There is a non‑trivial chance Congress acts earlier than expected, or that current gross debt is already very close to $37T such that modest catch‑up issuance would tip it over by June 27. \n- What would change my view: (1) A confirmed, up‑to‑date Debt to the Penny level showing the total already ≥$36.7T; (2) credible whip counts or scheduled votes indicating a debt‑limit increase well before mid‑June; (3) Treasury guidance on the X‑date and planned size of catch‑up issuance and trust‑fund restorations once the limit is raised. \n- Research assistant input: None provided beyond the prompt; forecast relies on public institutional knowledge of debt‑limit mechanics and typical issuance patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
