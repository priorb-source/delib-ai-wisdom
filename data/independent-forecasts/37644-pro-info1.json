  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic is a well-funded private company and has not announced any plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic leverages its recent substantial private funding from strategic partners like Amazon and Google to continue its R&D and scaling efforts, feeling no immediate pressure to raise capital or provide liquidity through a public offering. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by pressure from early venture investors seeking an exit and a desire to capitalize on a perceived peak in market enthusiasm for AI stocks, Anthropic fast-tracks its IPO plans. The company files an S-1 with the SEC or posts an official announcement on its website before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is that Anthropic is a private company with no announced IPO plans. This forecast puts significant weight on this status quo, primarily due to the information provided by my research assistant. Anthropic's recent, massive ~$3.5 billion funding round in March 2025 at a ~$61.5 billion valuation drastically reduces its need for capital from public markets in the immediate future. Companies typically do not raise such a large private round only to announce an IPO within the following three months. The timeline is extremely short; preparing and announcing an IPO between now (May 15) and the July 1 deadline would be unusually fast, though not impossible.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because the AI market is exceptionally volatile, and strategic decisions can change quickly. There might be immense pressure from early financial investors (distinct from strategic partners like Google and Amazon) to provide liquidity, or a competitor's move could force Anthropic's hand to maintain a leadership narrative. The company could have been preparing for an IPO in secret.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the recent funding round is a powerful signal that the company is comfortable with its current capital structure and strategic partners. Staying private allows Anthropic to avoid the intense scrutiny and short-term earnings pressure of public markets, which is a significant advantage in a capital-intensive, long-term R&D race. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of Anthropic hiring IPO advisors or a confidential S-1 filing. I would decrease it if executives publicly state they are focused on their long-term private partnerships.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
