  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Colombia remains at Level 2 Travel Health Notice status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak stabilizes or declines due to the mass vaccination campaign. The disease remains contained to rural/endemic areas without spreading to major urban centers or tourist destinations. CDC continues to view Level 2 (Enhanced Precautions) as appropriate risk communication.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak rapidly escalates with cases doubling or tripling in the next month. Urban transmission begins in major cities like Bogotá or Medellín. The vaccination campaign fails to control spread quickly enough. CDC determines the risk warrants escalating to Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) or Level 4.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The CDC has been monitoring Colombia's yellow fever situation since at least September 2024 (when cases began) and has maintained it at Level 2 despite the emergency declaration. Key factors: (1) The CDC typically reserves Level 3/4 for catastrophic situations - major pandemics, widespread Ebola outbreaks, war zones. (2) While 79 cases with a 45-50% fatality rate is serious, this represents growth over 7 months, not an explosive epidemic. (3) Yellow fever is vaccine-preventable and Colombia has initiated mass vaccination. (4) With only 39 days remaining, there's limited time for conditions to deteriorate sufficiently to trigger an escalation. (5) The outbreak appears contained to the 400+ high-risk municipalities, likely rural/endemic areas rather than major tourist destinations. Historical precedent shows CDC rarely escalates to Level 3 for yellow fever outbreaks unless they become massive urban epidemics. The fact that CDC has observed this situation for months without escalating suggests their risk assessment framework doesn't currently justify Level 3. For me to forecast higher, I'd need evidence of: explosive case growth, urban transmission, vaccine campaign failure, or international spread. For me to forecast lower, I'd need confirmation that cases are declining or that vaccination coverage is rapidly expanding. The 18% probability accounts for the tail risk of rapid deterioration but strongly weights the status quo persistence that characterizes most forecasting situations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nColombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
