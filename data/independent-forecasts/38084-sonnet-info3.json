  "information": "A late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days (resolution on June 28, 2025, current date is May 29, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - drought conditions persist with 20 million or more residents affected",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tropical Storm Alvin and subsequent weather systems bring substantial rainfall across California's major population centers in early June. The combination of tropical moisture and the Canadian low-pressure trough delivers widespread precipitation that significantly improves drought conditions, reducing the number of residents in drought-affected areas below 20 million by June 28.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions persist through June despite any rainfall. The tropical storm either dissipates, tracks away from California, or brings insufficient precipitation to major population centers. The dry summer pattern dominates, and 20 million or more residents remain in drought-designated areas when measured on June 28.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests a 'Yes' outcome. The SF Gate article indicates California's drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad' as of late May, suggesting substantial portions of the population are currently affected. With California's total population around 39 million, the 20 million threshold represents approximately 51% of residents.\n\nKey factors favoring 'Yes': (1) Only 30 days remain until resolution - too short for dramatic drought recovery without exceptional rainfall. (2) We're entering California's dry season (summer), when conditions typically worsen. (3) Drought Monitor classifications reflect longer-term precipitation deficits, not just recent rainfall. (4) The current baseline appears to already be at concerning levels.\n\nFactors creating uncertainty: The research assistant's report mentions potential for significant precipitation from Tropical Storm Alvin interacting with weather systems. However, this is highly uncertain - tropical storms tracking to California are relatively rare, their timing and trajectory are unpredictable, and even substantial rainfall might not remove drought designations within 30 days.\n\nMy forecast isn't higher (e.g., 85%) because: (1) There is genuine potential for rainfall events that could impact the numbers. (2) We lack current precise data on how many residents are affected now. (3) Unexpected weather patterns could develop.\n\nMy forecast isn't lower (e.g., 45%) because: (1) The status quo (drought persistence) deserves significant weight given the short timeframe. (2) One month of potential rainfall rarely eliminates drought conditions entirely. (3) Summer dry patterns typically dominate.\n\nI would update higher if: current data showed 25+ million already affected, or if weather forecasts showed persistent high pressure blocking any rainfall. I would update lower if: multiple major storm systems were confirmed tracking toward California, or if current data showed numbers closer to 15 million.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
