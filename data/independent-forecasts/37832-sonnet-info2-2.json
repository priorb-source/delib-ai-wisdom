  "information": "Databricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025 (about 5-6 weeks from today, May 22, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks does not announce IPO plans before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues its cautious approach to going public, with leadership deciding that market conditions or internal readiness don't warrant an announcement yet. The Data + AI Summit comes and goes without an IPO announcement, and the company defers any public offering plans to later in 2025 or 2026. No S-1 filing occurs and no announcement appears on their website before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks leverages its high-profile Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) as a strategic platform to announce IPO intentions, capitalizing on the presence of prominent CEOs from JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an announcement on the news section of its website before July 1, signaling readiness to go public later in 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between status quo bias and a clear catalyst event. We're already 5+ months into 2025 with no IPO announcement, despite the CEO mentioning 2025 as a possibility. This suggests that if an announcement were imminent in early 2025, we'd likely have seen signals by now. The CEO's previous characterization of 2024 as 'dumb' for IPOs indicates a cautious, market-timing approach.\n\nHowever, the Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) creates a natural focal point for such an announcement. The high-profile attendee list suggests this is a major event where significant announcements could be made. Major tech companies sometimes use their own conferences for strategic announcements.\n\nThat said, several factors argue for a lower probability: (1) IPO announcements often don't align with company conferences and follow their own timeline driven by market conditions and SEC readiness, (2) the short 40-day window means limited time for such a significant decision if not already in advanced planning, (3) the CEO's flexibility about timing ('2025 and 2026 as possibilities') suggests no hard deadline, and (4) most importantly, the absence of any announcements so far in 2025 follows the status quo pattern.\n\nFor my forecast to move higher, I'd need evidence of: preparation activities (hiring banks, auditor work), improved market conditions for tech IPOs, or direct signals from company leadership about imminent plans. For it to move lower, I'd need the summit to pass without announcement or statements from leadership indicating they're pushing to 2026.\n\nThe January report noting an IPO 'within a year wouldn't be a huge surprise' provides mild support but is already dated. Given that we're in late May with the summit as the main remaining catalyst before July 1, I estimate a modest but non-negligible probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
