    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days (from May 12 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's May 6 statement about wanting to step down is not acted upon within the 20-day window. The statement proves to be political posturing, requires more time for succession planning, or awaits Moscow's approval for a transition that extends beyond June 1. He continues in his official role through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following his May 6 statement, Kadyrov proceeds with a swift resignation or is formally removed from office. This could occur due to health reasons, a pre-planned succession already in motion, or urgent political circumstances requiring immediate transition. The change is officially announced and confirmed by credible sources before June 1.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between a significant recent signal (Kadyrov's public statement 6 days ago about wanting to step down) and the extremely short timeframe remaining (only 20 days). Political transitions in authoritarian contexts like Chechnya typically move slowly and require Kremlin approval, making rapid changes rare. While Kadyrov's statement is notable and cannot be dismissed, several factors suggest caution: (1) The 20-day window is very compressed for implementing such a major political change; (2) Political leaders often announce intentions to step down well before actual transitions occur; (3) No urgent crisis or health emergency has been reported that would force immediate action; (4) Such transitions require careful orchestration with Moscow. The status quo bias strongly favors continuation in office, especially over such a short period. However, the probability is not negligible because the statement was very recent and specific. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: active succession planning, specific transition dates announced, or urgent circumstances (health crisis, political crisis). For me to update lower, I would need Kadyrov or Kremlin officials to walk back the statement or clarify he will remain in position.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
