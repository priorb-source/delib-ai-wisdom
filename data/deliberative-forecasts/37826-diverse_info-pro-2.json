    "review": "My initial forecast was too low because I over-weighted the May 10 ceasefire as a signal of definitive de-escalation. Both other forecasters provided convincing arguments that the crisis is ongoing and the situation is more volatile than I assessed. Forecaster 2's point about the Indian Army Chief granting 'full authority' to Western Commanders for retaliation is crucial; this delegation lowers the threshold and shortens the decision-making loop for a kinetic response. Forecaster 3's identification of the recent strikes as part of a named 'Operation Sindoor' is a game-changer. It reframes events from a simple tit-for-tat exchange into a potential multi-phased campaign, making a follow-on strike in June far more plausible, even without a major new provocation. Forecaster 3 also made the excellent point that many Indian cross-border actions are limited to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and would not meet the resolution criteria, which is a key factor weighing against a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 10% to 25%. The combined arguments from the other forecasters convinced me that my initial assessment of a stable de-escalation was flawed. The situation is better understood as a tense pause within an ongoing crisis. The two key pieces of information driving my update are: 1) The delegation of retaliatory authority to local commanders, which increases the likelihood that a future ceasefire violation will trigger a swift, qualifying kinetic response. 2) The context of 'Operation Sindoor', which suggests Indian actions may be part of a pre-planned campaign rather than purely reactive, raising the probability of a further phase of strikes in June. My new forecast of 25% reflects this much higher baseline risk. I am not going higher, toward Forecaster 3's 33%, primarily because of the strong structural inhibitors: the immense risk of escalation between nuclear powers, intense international pressure for restraint, and the high likelihood that India would choose to retaliate in PoK (which would not resolve this question 'Yes') as a way to send a signal while managing escalation.",
