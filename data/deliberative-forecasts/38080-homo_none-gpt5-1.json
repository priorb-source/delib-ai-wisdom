    "review": "Both peers convincingly stress the status quo bias (revoked today ⇒ No unless something changes fast) and the twin risks of immigration/national‑security deference and an appellate stay even if a district court grants a TRO. They also surface two pathways I underweighted: (1) DHS’s possible use of “immediate withdrawal” authority within SEVP rules, which courts may be reluctant to second‑guess quickly; and (2) exhaustion/procedural defenses that could slow relief. Their timing caution is apt: getting not just a TRO but one that survives through July 1 is the bar. On the other hand, neither explicitly weighed venue (likely D. Mass./First Circuit), which could modestly increase the odds a TRO stands. Overall, their arguments justify shading down from my initial estimate, but not dramatically given the strong irreparable‑harm showing and APA mismatch concerns.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The dominant path to Yes remains a fast TRO/PI restoring certification (or enjoining the revocation) that is in effect on July 1. Harvard’s likelihood of securing emergency relief is material due to (a) acute, widespread irreparable harm to students and operations; (b) apparent mismatch between stated reasons (campus climate/CCP allegations) and SEVP’s regulatory criteria; and (c) the 2020 episode showing judicial and political sensitivity in this space. However, I increase weight on three downside factors: (1) if DHS invoked immediate‑withdrawal/national‑security authority, courts may defer more and be wary of compelling affirmative reinstatement on a short fuse; (2) government could promptly seek and obtain an appellate stay even after a favorable district ruling; and (3) procedural wrangling (exhaustion/administrative review) could slow implementation, making July 1 a tight target. Venue (Massachusetts/First Circuit) and the sheer scale of harm keep the odds near coin‑flip rather than clearly below. Net, I move down modestly from 65% to reflect elevated stay/deference risks within the short timeline.",
