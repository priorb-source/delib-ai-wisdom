    "review": "The other forecasters provide excellent, specific, bottom-up evidence that complements my more general, top-down base rate analysis. Forecaster 2 brings a compelling case for Mozambique's *removal*, citing a completed on-site visit. Forecaster 3 presents an equally strong case for the British Virgin Islands' *addition*, citing an expired remediation period and political non-opposition. Both lines of reasoning are convincing and add concrete evidence for a 'Yes' outcome. However, I believe their final probabilities of 85% and 75% are too low. They seem to anchor their forecasts on the success of a single one of these events, while discounting that only one of several potential changes needs to occur. The presence of both a strong removal candidate and a strong addition candidate makes a 'no change' outcome significantly less likely than if only one of these situations existed.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. My initial reasoning was based on the powerful historical base rate: 16 of the last 17 FATF plenaries have resulted in changes to the grey list. The specific country-level intelligence provided by the other forecasters has strengthened, not weakened, my conviction. We now have at least two distinct and highly plausible pathways to a 'Yes' resolution: the removal of Mozambique (which reportedly had a positive on-site visit in April) and the addition of the British Virgin Islands (whose grace period expired in February). For the question to resolve 'No', both of these high-probability events would need to fall through due to procedural or political issues, and no other country from the list of 25 would be removed, and no other jurisdiction would be added. The probability of all these potential changes failing to materialize simultaneously is very low. While I acknowledge the risk of procedural delays and political maneuvering cited by the other forecasters, which is why my forecast is not 99%, the existence of multiple, independent paths to a 'Yes' outcome reinforces my confidence at the 95% level.",
