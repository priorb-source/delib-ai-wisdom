  "information": "The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC rarely has active yellow fever Travel Health Notices for North American countries, and current elevated activity is centered in South America.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission continues largely in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru; no confirmed local transmission or notable epizootic is reported in any North American country (e.g., Panama, Caribbean). CDC keeps yellow fever notices focused on South American countries, so on June 1 no North American country appears on the Travel Health Notices page for yellow fever.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A spillover occurs into a North American country (most plausibly Panama, or less likely a Caribbean country such as Trinidad and Tobago), with confirmed human cases or significant nonhuman primate die-offs prompting CDC to post a Travel Health Notice titled “Yellow Fever in [Country],” which remains listed on or after June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: CDC Travel Health Notices for yellow fever in North America are uncommon; endemic risk in the region is limited (primarily parts of Panama), and CDC typically issues such notices in response to unusual events (outbreaks/epizootics), not routine background risk. The research assistant notes PAHO’s alert that Q1 2025 saw 131 cases and 53 deaths, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru—more than double all of 2024—indicating a significant regional upswing. That raises tail risk of northward spread, especially from Colombia toward Panama via the Darién region, where ecology (Haemagogus/Sabethes mosquitoes, primates) supports sylvatic transmission. However, two compounding events are needed within ~5–6 weeks: (1) confirmed local transmission or a notable epizootic in a North American country; and (2) CDC issuing a Travel Health Notice by June 1. Historically, such cross-border spread into Central America is infrequent, and the window is short. Why not higher: Despite elevated South American activity, there’s no current indication of North American transmission, and CDC notices for NA countries are rare; both biology and surveillance/notice timelines make a June 1 listing unlikely. Why not lower: The proximity of Colombian activity to Panama, ecological suitability, and vaccination program disruptions (as noted by the UN) increase the chance of spillover and a CDC notice more than in a typical year. Upward update triggers: PAHO or national reports of human cases or primate die-offs in Panama or Caribbean, new vaccination advisories/requirements from NA health ministries, or CDC preview/expansion of YF notices to include a NA country. Downward update triggers: Signs that the outbreak plateaus in South America, no northward spread by mid–late May, or explicit CDC communications limiting notices to South American countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
