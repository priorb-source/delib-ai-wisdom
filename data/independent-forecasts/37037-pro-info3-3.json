  "information": "The imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US President issues a proclamation correcting the 'scrivener's error' before June 1, 2025, and the Harmonized Tariff Schedule is updated to remove the 50% tariff on Lesotho for the specified item.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic delays persist, and the presidential proclamation required to correct the acknowledged tariff error is not issued and implemented by June 1, 2025, leaving the 50% tariff in place in the official schedule.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo. The 50% tariff on Lesotho for the specific textile category is the current reality, resulting from a confirmed 'scrivener's error' made in 2018. The U.S. Trade Representative's office acknowledged this error in March 2024 and stated they were working 'expeditiously' on a solution. However, as of today, over a year later, the problem persists, which indicates significant bureaucratic inertia. The correction requires a presidential proclamation, a formal process that can be slow for low-priority items. With only about a month until the resolution date, the probability that this long-delayed administrative action will be completed is low. The research assistant's report on broader trade disputes with the SADC, EU, and China is irrelevant to this specific case, which is an acknowledged administrative mistake, not a deliberate trade policy measure. My forecast is not higher because the error is embarrassing and harms a developing nation the U.S. purports to support via programs like AGOA; thus, there is non-zero pressure to rectify it. My forecast is not lower because the observed delay of over a year strongly suggests this is not an urgent priority, and government processes are notoriously slow. I would lower my forecast upon any official announcement that a correcting proclamation is imminent or has been signed. Conversely, I would raise it if credible reports emerged that the administration's trade team is completely preoccupied with more significant global issues.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
