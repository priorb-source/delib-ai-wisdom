    "review": "- I agree with both forecasters that the tight timeline (only the mid‑June FOMC before July 1, barring an intermeeting move) pushes the baseline toward No.\n- Forecaster 2 likely understates how much new information the Fed will have before that meeting. The Committee will see two CPI prints (Apr and May), one core PCE print (Apr), and at least one more jobs report before the decision, which could, in principle, shift the calculus. So it isn’t just “a single month of data.”\n- Forecaster 3’s 30% seems high given the Fed’s recent emphasis on needing “greater confidence” in disinflation and the asymmetry of risks after sticky early‑year inflation. A cut would probably require multiple soft inflation prints plus clearer labor cooling or a shock. Those conditions are possible but not the base case.\n- Both are right that an intermeeting cut would require a clear shock/financial stress, which is low probability absent new catalysts.\n- Net: F2’s logic supports a slightly lower probability than my prior, while F3 highlights the data‑dependence and one real meeting window. I find F2’s caution more compelling than F3’s 30% given the Fed’s communications and high bar to cut by June.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~7 weeks, with one scheduled decision (June) and very low odds of an intermeeting cut. The Fed will have meaningful new data (two CPI readings, one core PCE, one more jobs report) and the June SEP, which could provide cover if the data decisively improve. Still, the Committee has repeatedly signaled it needs sustained evidence that inflation is moving toward 2% before easing. After earlier stickiness, risk management argues for patience unless disinflation and labor cooling are both clear. Given that bar, and the short window, a cut by June requires either (a) a string of soft prints and labor market slackening that restore confidence quickly, or (b) a negative shock. Those paths are plausible but not likely. Relative to my prior 18%, I trim to 15% to reflect the high bar and the Fed’s preference to wait for more than a brief run of benign data before cutting, while still allowing for a non‑negligible chance via favorable data or a shock.",
