  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The observation period is June 2025, and the outcome will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, a pilot report from South America will not be posted for June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "During June 2025, no pilots flying over South America observe a UAP, or any pilots who do have a sighting do not submit a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). Consequently, when the NUFORC database is checked after the resolution date, no qualifying reports from the continent for that month are found.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A pilot flying over a country in South America observes an anomalous aerial phenomenon in June 2025. The pilot is aware of NUFORC as a reporting channel and submits a report, which is then processed and posted to the NUFORC website for June 2025 before the resolution check occurs.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low historical frequency of qualifying events. The research indicates that the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives only 1-2 pilot reports from South America per year on average. Assuming these events are distributed randomly throughout the year, the baseline probability for such a report occurring in any given month is between 1/12 (8.3%) and 2/12 (16.7%). This low base rate makes the 'No' outcome the status quo and most likely scenario.\n\nMy forecast of 10% is anchored on the lower end of this calculated range. The primary reason is the significant friction in the reporting process: NUFORC is a US-based entity with an English-language reporting form, which likely leads to under-reporting from pilots in predominantly Spanish and Portuguese-speaking South America. They may prefer to report to local authorities if such channels exist, or not at all. While there is increased global interest in UAPs, this is largely driven by US military and government activity, and its effect on the reporting habits of South American pilots to a US civilian website is likely minimal.\n\nThis forecast is not lower because reports from this region, while rare, are not non-existent, as evidenced by recent sightings from Brazil (Dec 2024) and Chile (Feb 2023). A probability near zero would incorrectly dismiss the established, albeit low, frequency. The forecast is not higher because doing so would require evidence of a systematic change, such as a surge in recent reports from the region or a new partnership encouraging South American pilots to use NUFORC, none of which is present.\n\nI would increase my forecast if new information emerged before June, such as a cluster of pilot sightings in South America during May, or news of a major military exercise in the region involving significant air traffic. Conversely, I would decrease it if evidence suggested NUFORC's data intake from international sources was declining or if a major South American country established a popular, competing UAP reporting system.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
