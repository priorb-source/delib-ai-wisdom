  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (resolution window ends June 15, 2025; qualifying call must occur May 13–June 14, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump completes his mid‑May Gulf trip without a leader‑level call to Putin; any coordination about a future meeting is handled via aides. The Kremlin keeps signaling that preparation must occur at expert levels, and neither side publicizes a new call. Even if an informal contact occurs, one side does not acknowledge it publicly, so it does not count.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To pave the way for a future meeting or to discuss Ukraine or sanctions, the two hold another call during or shortly after Trump’s Gulf trip, or around early June (e.g., near SPIEF). Both the Kremlin and Trump’s team publicly confirm the call with readouts or statements.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Credible reports indicate two acknowledged phone calls already took place in 2025 (Feb 12 ~90 minutes; Mar 18 on Ukraine/ceasefire). On Apr 4, the Kremlin said no calls were planned in the near future. On May 5, Peskov said a Putin–Trump meeting is ‘certainly necessary’ but requires substantial preparation; no dates or specifics. Trump plans mid‑May travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, and has floated the idea of meeting Putin, while Peskov says Putin has no Middle East trip scheduled.\n- Window and bar: A qualifying call must occur between May 13 and June 14 and be acknowledged by both sides. That acknowledgment condition slightly lowers odds vs. “any call.”\n- Status quo weight: The default is no new call in any given 34‑day window. Leader‑level calls are lumpy and usually prepped; current Kremlin messaging stresses expert‑level prep and no specific plans. That points to No as the baseline.\n- Reasons for Yes: The channel is clearly active (two earlier calls); both sides have incentives to demonstrate relevance and shape narratives on Ukraine and broader geopolitics. Trump’s mid‑May Gulf trip creates a natural hook for coordination or publicity; early June events (e.g., SPIEF) could generate another.\n- Reasons for No: Short window; Kremlin’s emphasis on preparation reduces near‑term leader‑level contact; in‑person meeting talk could delay principal calls; political optics could make either side choose not to acknowledge a call even if one occurs, which would resolve as No.\n- Why not higher: Lack of concrete scheduling signals; Peskov’s recent framing about preparation; the narrow window and acknowledgment requirement.\n- Why not lower: Demonstrated recent cadence (two calls in ~5 weeks earlier), mutual openness to engagement, and upcoming travel/agenda catalysts suggest materially non‑zero odds.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of planned coordination at leader level, statements hinting at an imminent call, or readouts of staff‑level talks explicitly foreshadowing a principals’ call; Trump indicating he will speak with Putin during or immediately after the Gulf trip.\n- What would move me down: Strong denials of near‑term principal contact, conclusion of Trump’s Gulf trip without any signaling, a pivot to planning only an in‑person meeting later, or domestic/political events that make acknowledgment of a call costly for either side.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
