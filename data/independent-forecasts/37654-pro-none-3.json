    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective's status in the tracker would remain 'in progress' or be changed to another status other than 'complete' by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new administration, even if aligned with Project 2025, fails to complete the complex legislative and administrative process of breaking up NOAA within its first five months in office. Political opposition, bureaucratic inertia, and competing priorities prevent the action from being finalized, so the spreadsheet's status is not updated to 'complete' by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new administration makes breaking up NOAA a top 'Day One' priority, issuing a sweeping executive order to dissolve the agency and reassign its components. Despite the practical implementation taking much longer, the tracker's maintainers judge this decisive executive action as fulfilling the objective and mark its status as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 2%. The primary driver for this low probability is the extremely short timeline. The question requires the complete breakup of a major federal agency within approximately five months of a new presidential administration taking office. The status quo heavily favors a 'No' outcome, as major government reorganizations are complex, contentious, and typically take years to legislate and implement, not months. The institutional inertia and the political opposition from scientific, environmental, and commercial groups that rely on NOAA would be immense. The forecast is not zero because a new administration could take a swift and decisive executive action that, while not completing the breakup in practice, could be interpreted as 'complete' by the maintainers of the tracker spreadsheet, on whom the resolution depends. The probability is not higher because the practical, legal, and political hurdles to achieving this in such a compressed timeframe are formidable. I would update my forecast higher if specific legislation to this effect were to be fast-tracked in Congress early in 2025. My confidence in a 'No' outcome would increase if the new administration's initial priorities lie elsewhere.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
