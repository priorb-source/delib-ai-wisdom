    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. A review of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) does not currently show any subheading that lists a 50% tariff for Lesotho.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government makes no changes to the HTS regarding Lesotho before the resolution date. The administrative situation from 2018, which may have been temporary or an error, is not reintroduced. This represents a continuation of the current policy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the next month, the U.S. government either makes a deliberate policy decision to impose a 50% tariff on certain goods from Lesotho due to an unforeseen and severe trade dispute, or a significant clerical error is made and published in the HTS.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the current version of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). A thorough check of the HTS shows no currently active subheading that imposes a '+ 50%' tariff on products from Lesotho. The 2018 article referenced in the background information appears to describe an outdated situation, which may have been a temporary administrative designation or an error that has since been corrected. The status quo is therefore a 'No' outcome.\n\nThe timeframe for resolution is very short (June 1, 2025), making significant shifts in trade policy highly unlikely. For the outcome to be 'Yes', the U.S. government would need to actively introduce this specific tariff within the next month. There are currently no public indicators of a trade dispute with Lesotho that would precipitate such a punitive and specific measure; in fact, Lesotho is a beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Therefore, the 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% to account for the small, non-zero chance of an unexpected event, such as a major clerical error in the publication of the HTS or a sudden, black swan geopolitical event that forces a rapid and targeted policy change. \n\nMy probability is not higher because there is no positive evidence supporting a 'Yes' outcome. The entire premise rests on an outdated news article, which is contradicted by the current official tariff schedule. I would only increase my forecast if the U.S. Trade Representative or Department of Commerce announced new tariffs targeting Lesotho.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
