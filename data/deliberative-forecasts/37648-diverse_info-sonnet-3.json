    "review": "Forecaster 2 reached the same 40% conclusion with similar reasoning, emphasizing positive diplomatic signals against tight timeline constraints. However, Forecaster 3 raises compelling counterarguments I had underweighted: (1) The US recently imposed NEW SANCTIONS during negotiations - this is a critical red flag indicating the talks may not be as advanced as positive rhetoric suggests; (2) Specific maximalist US demands (complete uranium removal, centrifuge dismantling, no sunset clauses) are far beyond what Iran would accept and exceed even the original JCPOA terms; (3) Iran calling sanctions during talks 'unacceptable' reveals fundamental discord; (4) Past breakthroughs had visible preparatory signals (minister-level meetings, IAEA access deals) we're not seeing now; (5) The PUBLIC announcement requirement adds another hurdle beyond private understandings; (6) Israeli media reports could be strategic signaling rather than actual intelligence assessment. These are substantial points that challenge the optimistic interpretation of 'convergence' language. The combination of maximalist US positions, new sanctions during talks, and the extremely short timeline makes a comprehensive deal highly unlikely. However, Forecaster 3's 8% may be too low given the sustained engagement across multiple rounds, active mediation channels, and the possibility of a limited interim freeze-for-sanctions arrangement that could satisfy the question's criteria without meeting maximalist demands.",
    "rationale": "I am updating significantly downward from 40% based on Forecaster 3's evidence, particularly the new sanctions during negotiations and the gap between reported US demands and Iranian red lines. Imposing sanctions while negotiating suggests either bad faith or significant unresolved issues. The maximalist US positions (complete uranium removal, centrifuge dismantling) are historically non-starters for Iran and go beyond the JCPOA framework. However, I'm not dropping to 8% because: (1) Four completed rounds with a fifth scheduled indicates genuine sustained engagement, not performative diplomacy; (2) Multiple sources report 'convergence' and 'progress' - while this could be spin, complete fabrication across both sides and mediators seems unlikely; (3) There remains a viable path to a LIMITED interim deal (freeze-for-sanctions-relief) that wouldn't meet maximalist demands but could be publicly announced and satisfy the question's criteria; (4) Strong economic incentives exist for both sides. My updated forecast of 20% reflects significant skepticism about a comprehensive deal while acknowledging the non-trivial possibility of a limited arrangement that both sides could frame as meeting their core interests within the available timeframe.",
