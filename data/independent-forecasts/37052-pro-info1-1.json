  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in any country in Africa or Latin America.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without a successful coup d'état in any country across Africa or Latin America. While there may be political tensions or even unsuccessful attempts, no government is successfully overthrown by its military or other state elites.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A successful coup is executed in a politically volatile country, most likely within Africa's Sahel region. A faction of the military or other state elites seizes control of the government, detains the incumbent leader, and consolidates power, with the event being widely reported by credible international media.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% balances the short remaining timeframe against the exceptionally high level of political instability and recent coup activity, particularly in West Africa. The primary reason for this forecast not being higher is the brief two-month window; successful coups are major, disruptive events and are inherently less likely to occur in any short period. The status quo, which is the absence of a coup, is the most probable outcome on any given day. However, a significant probability is warranted due to the demonstrated trend of coups in the Sahel region since 2020. The research assistant's report of recently foiled attempts in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and Chad (January 2025) confirms that the intent and plotting for such events are currently active, even if success is not guaranteed. The formation of the 'Sahel Alliance' by junta-led states and the weak international response to previous coups have lowered the deterrent for potential plotters in neighboring countries. My forecast is not lower because this 'coup contagion' effect makes the current environment fundamentally more volatile than historical averages would suggest. I would increase this forecast upon news of a major political crisis, widespread protests, or a significant military mutiny in a high-risk country (e.g., Chad, Sudan). I would decrease it if regional bodies took unexpectedly firm and credible preventative actions against a potential coup plot.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
