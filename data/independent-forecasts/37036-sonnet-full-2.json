  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not announced his candidacy yet, having only formed an exploratory committee in early April 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploratory phase through May and announces his candidacy in June or July 2025 (consistent with his stated timeline of 'early summer'), or decides to delay even further, or chooses not to run at all",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates his decision-making process and announces his candidacy in late April or May 2025, either due to political momentum, fundraising needs, or in response to Trump's recent endorsement of Ricketts",
    "rationale": "The base rate evidence strongly suggests Osborn will not announce before June 1. Key factors: (1) His exploratory committee was formed only 2-3 weeks ago in early April, (2) He publicly stated he will 'decide by early summer' - which typically means June/July, at or after the cutoff, (3) Historical data shows exploratory committees last 3-6 months before formal announcements, putting an announcement in June-September range, (4) His own 2024 Senate race followed a pattern where announcement came 16 months before the election, which for 2026 would mean June-July 2025. However, there are countervailing factors: some 2026 candidates announced in April 2025, and political pressures (Trump's endorsement of Ricketts, media attention) could accelerate his timeline. With 38 days remaining, there's still meaningful time for an announcement, but the preponderance of evidence suggests he's following a slower timeline. The forecast is not lower because political circumstances can change quickly and 38 days provides real opportunity for acceleration. It's not higher because all the base rate evidence - his own statements, historical patterns, and the recent formation of his exploratory committee - point toward a June/July announcement window. I would update higher if Osborn makes statements suggesting an imminent announcement or if reporting indicates accelerated campaign preparation. I would update lower if he reiterates a June/July timeline or if his exploratory activities remain low-key through early May.",
