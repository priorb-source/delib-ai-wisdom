    "review": "Both forecasters provided excellent, complementary critiques that exposed significant overconfidence in my initial analysis. I found their reasoning highly convincing and have substantially updated my forecast as a result.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis was pivotal in recalibrating my assessment of the underlying events. I was overly swayed by the large aggregate participation numbers (e.g., 600,000). Forecaster 2 astutely introduced the Crowd Counting Consortium's data on *average* event size, correctly pointing out that a 10,000+ participant protest would need to be a major outlier, not a given. Their calculation of a ~500-person average for the April 5th events starkly illustrated that a wide distribution of protests does not guarantee a single massive one.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis was even more impactful because it focused on the most critical and uncertain part of the question: the resolution criteria. I had treated the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) as a passive, accurate recorder. Forecaster 3 correctly identified it as the 'binding constraint,' highlighting its curated nature, potential for significant reporting lags, and—most importantly—the risk of ambiguous size labels (e.g., 'thousands') that would fail to meet the strict resolution criteria. Their observation that, as of May 2, the tracker had not yet logged the major April or May protests is a powerful piece of evidence I had not considered.",
    "rationale": "I am making a very large update to my forecast, lowering it from 95% to 55%. My initial confidence was based on the flawed assumption that the massive nationwide protests in April and May almost certainly included a qualifying event and that the Global Protest Tracker would dutifully record it. The other forecasters persuasively demonstrated the flaws in both parts of that assumption.\n\nFirst, as Forecaster 2 argued, the fragmented nature of modern protests means that high aggregate numbers do not guarantee a single event will cross a high threshold like 10,000 participants. While still plausible for a 'major demonstration' in a large city, it is far from certain.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, Forecaster 3's focus on the resolution source was a crucial correction. The GPT is not a comprehensive database. It is a curated product with its own methodology, cadence, and naming conventions. The fact that it has not yet listed the major April 5 or May 1 events is strong evidence of either a significant lag or that these events will not be included in a way that satisfies the resolution criteria. The possibility that the GPT might use vague language like 'thousands' instead of an explicit '10,000+' introduces a critical failure path I had completely ignored.\n\nDespite this major downward revision, I am keeping my forecast slightly above 50%. There are still two equally plausible paths to a 'Yes' resolution. The first is that the GPT, with its known lag, will eventually back-fill one of the major protests from April or May with a qualifying number. The sheer scale makes this a reasonable possibility. The second is that a new, large-scale protest will occur before the July 1 deadline, perhaps spurred by a major political event like a Supreme Court decision, and will be notable enough to warrant timely and specific inclusion in the tracker. These two paths combined lead me to believe a 'Yes' outcome is still slightly more likely than not.",
