  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov continues in his role through June 1, 2025. His May 6 statement is revealed to be similar to his previous statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022 - not a genuine resignation request. Putin does not formally accept any resignation, and Kadyrov continues his duties as he has since 2007.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Putin accepts Kadyrov's resignation request within the next 20 days due to genuine health concerns or strategic succession planning. A formal announcement is made, and Kadyrov is officially removed from the position before June 1, 2025, possibly with his son Adam or another loyalist designated as successor.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors the status quo. Kadyrov has held this position for 18 years and has made similar public statements about stepping down at least three times (2016, 2020, 2022) without actually leaving office. This establishes a clear pattern that such statements do not predict actual departure. The very short timeframe (20 days) makes meaningful political change particularly unlikely. By May 12, Kadyrov is already walking back his statement, attributing his demeanor to the Ukraine operation rather than resignation plans. Putin's reported response of 'full understanding and support' with praise for achievements does not sound like acceptance of a resignation - it sounds like encouragement to continue. Several factors prevent me from going even lower: (1) credible reports of serious health issues including pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems that could genuinely incapacitate him, (2) active succession planning with rapid promotions of family members to key positions, and (3) the fact that he did meet with Putin shortly after the statement, suggesting something substantive was discussed. However, executing a major leadership transition in Chechnya within 20 days would be extraordinarily rushed for Russia's political system, even if the intent existed. For me to update significantly higher, I would need to see: concrete transition announcements, official Kremlin statements about accepting resignation, or formal nomination of a successor. The combination of established pattern, short timeframe, and recent backtracking makes this outcome highly unlikely despite health concerns.",
