    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate of GDP about 3 months after the quarter ends, which would place the Q1 2025 third estimate release around late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The advance estimate showed Q1 2025 real GDP contracted at an annual rate of -0.3%. If this estimate holds relatively stable through subsequent revisions, the outcome would be No (not greater than 0.0%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or shows even weaker growth than the advance estimate. Additional data incorporated in the second and third estimates shows consumer spending, business investment, or trade were weaker than initially reported. The -0.3% reading either remains negative or revises further downward, keeping Q1 2025 in contraction territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "More complete data incorporated in subsequent estimates reveals the economy performed better than initially thought. Consumer spending, inventory changes, government spending, or trade data revises upward by enough to add at least 0.3+ percentage points to the growth rate, pushing it from -0.3% to positive territory (above 0.0%).",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate of -0.3% annualized real GDP growth for Q1 2025 places the economy just barely in contraction territory. Historical patterns show that GDP revisions between advance and third estimates typically range from -1 to +1 percentage point, though most revisions are smaller. For this question to resolve Yes, we need a revision of at least +0.3 percentage points to move from negative to positive growth. While such revisions occur, they represent a departure from the initial estimate. The status quo strongly favors the No outcome - the advance estimate indicates contraction, and absent compelling reasons to expect significant upward revisions, we should weight this heavily. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The magnitude is very close to zero, making it easier for revisions to flip the sign; (2) Advance estimates are based on incomplete data and can be subject to meaningful revisions; (3) No information about the second estimate is provided, which would give us a clearer signal if available. My forecast is not higher because the initial report showed contraction, and most GDP revisions don't change the fundamental direction of growth when the initial estimate is clear. My forecast is not lower because the -0.3% reading is quite close to zero, meaning relatively modest positive revisions could flip the outcome. I would revise upward if the second estimate (released before the third) shows a significant upward revision toward or into positive territory. I would revise downward if the second estimate confirms or worsens the contraction.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
