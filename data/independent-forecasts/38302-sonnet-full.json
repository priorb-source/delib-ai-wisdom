  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7-8 days. China typically releases CPI data around the 9th-10th of the following month, so May 2025 data should be released around June 9-10, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - continuation of deflation. China has experienced three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation in its CPI, establishing a clear deflationary trend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May CPI comes in at 0% or positive. This could occur if energy price increases (Brent crude up 4% YoY) translate more strongly into domestic prices, pork prices rebound from high inventory levels, domestic demand unexpectedly strengthens, or favorable base effects from May 2024 provide support. The recent RRR cut could also stimulate demand faster than expected.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May CPI remains negative. This would occur if weak domestic demand persists as indicated by manufacturing PMI contraction (49.5), continued property sector decline (-8.6% in new home sales), sustained PPI deflation (-2.7%, worst in six months), and energy/food price pressures remain negative year-on-year. The mid-May RRR cut would be too recent to meaningfully impact May data.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors continued deflation given the three-month established trend of negative CPI readings. Key supporting evidence includes: (1) Manufacturing PMI at 49.5 showing contraction for the second consecutive month, indicating sustained weak demand. (2) PPI at -2.7%, the largest decline in six months, suggesting factory-gate deflation is intensifying rather than improving. (3) Property sector continuing to decline with new home sales down 8.6% YoY in May. (4) Core CPI remaining very low at +0.5%, indicating underlying demand is weak. However, the deflationary magnitude has moderated from -0.7% in February to -0.1% in both March and April, suggesting the trend may be stabilizing. The RRR cut implemented in mid-May is a positive policy signal but too recent to meaningfully affect May CPI data given typical transmission lags. While Brent crude increased 4% YoY, domestic energy prices remained negative YoY, and pork prices stayed depressed due to high inventories. I place the probability at 72% rather than higher because: the deflationary trend has been moderating, oil price increases could provide some upward pressure, and we cannot rule out positive base effects from May 2024. I don't go lower because: the three-month trend is well-established, all major economic indicators point to weak demand, PPI is worsening not improving, and policy measures are too recent to have substantial impact. For me to update higher, I would need to see evidence of accelerating deflation or worsening economic data in May. To update lower, I would need signs of unexpected demand recovery or clearer evidence that oil price increases are feeding through to consumer prices.",
