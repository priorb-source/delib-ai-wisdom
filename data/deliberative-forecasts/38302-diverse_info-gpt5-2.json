    "review": "Forecaster 2’s framing is solid: the headline is hovering right at the margin (-0.1%), core CPI is modestly positive, and the deflation impulse has been narrowing. That rightly lowers confidence in a fourth negative print and highlights that small component moves or measurement noise could flip the sign. The reminder about persistent PPI deflation is relevant but only loosely connected to headline CPI in the near term. Forecaster 3 adds PMI contraction and weak housing data. Those are directionally consistent with subdued demand, but they’re weak short‑run predictors of the sign of headline CPI when food and administered energy components dominate the month-to-month risk. I find 80% too high given how close the headline is to zero and the potential for holiday-related services strength or small energy pass‑through to tip it positive.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that food (notably pork) and domestic energy stay negative YoY in May, outweighing modestly positive services/core. Brent was slightly higher YoY, but pass‑through to regulated retail fuel is muted and lagged; the RRR cut is too small/late in the month to matter for May prices. The additional data cited by Forecaster 3 (PMI <50, weak home sales) marginally reinforce demand softness, which supports a small tilt toward another negative headline. However, Forecaster 2’s point about the very small magnitude of deflation (-0.1%) and positive core means the sign could flip on relatively small moves in a few categories, particularly around the May Day holiday in services. Net, I slightly increase my probability to reflect the macro softness, but keep it only modestly above 50 given the knife‑edge setup and potential for base/holiday effects to push headline to 0 or +0.1.",
