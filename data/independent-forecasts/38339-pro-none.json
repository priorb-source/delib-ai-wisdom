    "status_quo_outcome": "The gas agreement between Bulgargaz and BOTAŞ remains in effect, and no official announcement of its cancellation is made by either party before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite significant financial and political pressure in Bulgaria to exit the deal, the complexities of the international energy agreement, including potential legal challenges and financial penalties for breach of contract, prevent a formal cancellation announcement before July 1, 2025. The parties may be in tense negotiations or preparing for arbitration, but the contract officially remains in place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the severe financial distress of Bulgargaz, which is reportedly near bankruptcy due to the agreement, and amplified by domestic political pressure and an ongoing EU investigation, the Bulgarian government or Bulgargaz makes a formal, public announcement that it is unilaterally terminating the agreement with BOTAŞ.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast weighs the immense pressure on Bulgaria to cancel the deal against the significant inertia and high costs associated with breaking a major international energy agreement, especially within a very short timeframe of less than one month. The status quo is that the deal, while highly contentious and financially damaging for Bulgargaz, remains legally binding. The primary arguments for cancellation (a 'Yes' outcome) are the dire financial situation of Bulgargaz and the strong political calls for termination from figures like former PM Boyko Borissov, supported by an ongoing EU antitrust investigation. These factors create a volatile situation where a sudden political decision to cut losses cannot be ruled out. However, the arguments against cancellation before the July 1 deadline (a 'No' outcome) are stronger. Terminating such a contract typically involves complex legal processes, negotiations, and the risk of severe financial penalties and diplomatic fallout. Governments and state-owned enterprises usually avoid such drastic, unilateral actions unless all other options are exhausted. Given there are only 24 days until the deadline, it is more likely that any process to exit the deal would extend beyond this date. The status quo bias is strong here; these agreements are designed to be difficult to break. My probability is not lower than 20% because the financial situation at Bulgargaz is described as critical, which could force the government's hand into taking drastic, unorthodox action sooner rather than later. The resolution only requires an announcement, not a legally finalized termination, making a 'Yes' outcome possible via a purely political declaration. My probability is not higher because the barriers to unilateral cancellation—legal, financial, and diplomatic—are substantial, and acting within three weeks is highly improbable for such a significant state-level contract. I would increase the probability of 'Yes' if there were reports of emergency cabinet meetings in Sofia on this topic or leaks suggesting an imminent announcement. I would decrease it if Bulgarian officials made statements emphasizing a negotiated or arbitrated solution, implying a longer-term process.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
