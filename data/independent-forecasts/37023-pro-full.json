  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The preliminary May 2025 data is typically released mid-month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The index has seen four consecutive monthly declines, with the most recent drop being particularly sharp. Continuing this trend would result in a May figure at or below the April level of 50.8.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negative factors cited in April persist or worsen. Concerns over tariffs, rising inflation expectations, and potential unemployment remain top-of-mind for consumers. Continued market volatility and news of price increases from companies solidify pessimistic outlooks, causing the sentiment index to stagnate at its historical low or decline further.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant positive economic event occurs in late April or early May, causing a rapid reversal in consumer mood. This could be a major de-escalation in the trade war, a surprisingly strong jobs report, a notable and sustained drop in gasoline prices, or a significant stock market rally that convinces consumers the worst is over, leading to a modest rebound in the index above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the powerful downward momentum in consumer sentiment and the fundamental economic factors driving it. The April 2025 reading of 50.8 is the second-lowest on record, marking a fourth consecutive monthly decline. The drop from March (57.0) was severe, and the director's note that the pessimism is 'pervasive and unanimous' across all demographics suggests this is a deep-seated concern, not a fleeting one. Key drivers for this pessimism, as noted by my research assistant, include year-ahead inflation expectations at a multi-decade high, rising unemployment fears, and the tangible impact of tariffs causing price hikes by major companies. These macroeconomic factors rarely reverse course in a single month. The status quo is a continued decline. The probability is not lower than 25% because sentiment is at a historical low, and 'reversion to the mean' or even random statistical noise after such a sharp drop could cause a minor technical bounce. A reading of just 50.9 would be enough to resolve the question as 'Yes'. The probability is not higher because a genuine recovery would require a significant positive catalyst to counteract the strong negative economic data and momentum. Simply an absence of new bad news is unlikely to be sufficient. I would increase my probability with news of a major tariff rollback or a surprisingly positive inflation report. I would decrease it with news of further tariff escalations or a weak jobs report for April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
