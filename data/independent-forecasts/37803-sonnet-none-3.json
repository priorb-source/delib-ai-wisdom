    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days, from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The site remains DOWN. As of May 5, 2025, climate.mil was down for everyone, and there is no indication of restoration efforts.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration maintains its position on removing climate-related content from federal websites, and climate.mil remains offline through July 1, 2025 and beyond. No legal, congressional, or military pressure succeeds in restoring the portal within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site is restored before July 1, 2025 due to one or more factors: military leadership successfully argues for its restoration based on operational necessity and national security concerns; congressional pressure or legislation forces its return; legal challenges succeed; or the administration moderates its position on military climate resources.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. The site has been down since at least early February 2025 (based on The Guardian article) and remained down as of May 5, over 3 months. With only 6 weeks remaining until resolution, there's limited time for the significant policy reversal that would be required. The Trump administration has demonstrated a clear pattern of purging climate-related content from federal websites, and a military climate resilience portal fits squarely within that agenda. My research assistant provided no information suggesting restoration efforts are underway. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because: (1) military climate concerns have some bipartisan support given national security implications, (2) there's sufficient time for legal or congressional intervention, (3) operational military needs might force practical considerations, and (4) six weeks allows for unforeseen developments. The forecast is not higher because the site has been down for months without restoration signals, the administration's stance appears firm, and policy reversals typically take longer than 6 weeks. I would update higher if news emerged of congressional action, military leadership public pressure, or court proceedings. I would update lower if the administration made explicit statements about permanently closing climate-related military resources.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
