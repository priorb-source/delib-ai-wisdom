  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025. The Morning Consult data is updated monthly, so we are waiting for one or two more data releases before the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Sánchez maintains higher approval than Erdoğan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating rises above Sánchez's between now and July 1, 2025. This could occur if Turkey's improving consumer confidence (which gained 5% in April) translates into significantly higher approval for Erdoğan, or if Spain experiences a political crisis or scandal that depresses Sánchez's ratings. A tie would also result in No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains his current lead over Erdoğan through July 1, 2025. This is supported by Spain's ongoing economic recovery and the current 3-percentage-point advantage (35% vs 32% as of May 8). No major political upheavals occur in either country that would significantly shift ratings.",
    "rationale": "The most recent available data from May 8, 2025 shows Sánchez leading Erdoğan by 3 percentage points (35% to 32%). With only about one month remaining until the resolution date, I'm applying substantial weight to this status quo outcome, as approval ratings typically exhibit inertia over short time horizons without major precipitating events. The research assistant notes that Spain is experiencing economic recovery, which should provide some support for Sánchez's ratings. While Turkey's consumer confidence improved 5% in April, this is just one indicator and doesn't guarantee corresponding approval rating increases for Erdoğan. Both leaders reportedly have high disapproval rates overall based on January data, suggesting they operate in similar challenging political environments. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because: (1) the 3-point lead is modest and well within the range of normal monthly fluctuation, (2) Morning Consult ratings can shift based on recent events, and (3) Turkey's economic indicators show some positive momentum. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 50-60%) because: (1) the data is quite recent (3 weeks old), (2) the time horizon is very short for significant reversals, and (3) there's no evidence of an imminent crisis in Spain or major positive development for Erdoğan. I would update higher if: subsequent data shows Sánchez's lead growing or stable, or if negative news emerges about Erdoğan. I would update lower if: interim data shows the gap closing, Spain faces a political crisis, or Turkey experiences a major positive development that could boost Erdoğan's standing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%.

Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
