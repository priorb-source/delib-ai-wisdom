    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The annual meeting is a routine corporate governance event that is scheduled and announced in advance. The status quo is that the meeting will take place as planned on the specified date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden surge in retail investor interest, potentially fueled by social media activity, overwhelms the capacity of the virtual meeting platform's servers. The platform crashes, and Gamestop is forced to postpone the meeting after it has begun, meaning it does not 'fully complete' on June 12, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anticipating massive interest after the 2024 server crash, Gamestop invests heavily in a high-capacity, robust virtual meeting platform. The infrastructure holds up to the high volume of attendees, and the annual meeting proceeds and concludes as scheduled on June 12, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for a publicly-traded company's scheduled annual meeting occurring as planned is very high. These are regulatory requirements and are planned well in advance. Therefore, the status quo strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome. The primary risk factor is a repeat of the 2024 server crash caused by overwhelming interest. However, this past failure makes a future failure less likely. The 2024 event was a high-profile embarrassment, and it is almost certain that the company's management has made preventing a recurrence a top priority. They have had a full year to contract with a more robust vendor and plan for extreme load scenarios. It is more likely they will over-prepare than under-prepare. My forecast is not higher than 90% because meme stock interest is notoriously difficult to predict. A sudden, unprecedented spike in traffic could still exceed even a well-provisioned system, and the resolution criteria are very strict: any postponement for any reason resolves the question to 'No'. My forecast is not lower than 90% because the problem is a known technical challenge, not a fundamental uncertainty. The company has strong incentives and the resources to solve it. I would lower my forecast if there were to be a massive surge in GME stock volatility and social media chatter in the days leading up to the meeting. I would raise my forecast if Gamestop or its meeting vendor released a statement detailing their enhanced capacity and preparations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
