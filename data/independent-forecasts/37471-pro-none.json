    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The FRED data for May 2025 is typically released in the last week of the following month, so late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recent year-over-year trend suggests an increase of about 3,000 units per month. Projecting this forward from the 500,000 level in February 2025 would lead to a figure around 509,000 by May 2025, which is below the 550,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mortgage rates stabilize or slightly decrease, providing a modest boost to sales during the spring buying season. In response to the already high inventory, home builders scale back on new housing starts and completions. This combination of steadier demand and moderated supply growth causes the inventory level to rise, but not fast enough to exceed 550,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Persistently high inflation or other negative economic news leads the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance, causing mortgage rates to rise further. The increase in borrowing costs stifles housing demand. Meanwhile, a large number of homes started in late 2024 are completed and added to the market, causing inventory to swell rapidly and surpass the 550,000 mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored to the status quo trend. The number of new homes for sale increased by approximately 34,000 between February 2024 and February 2025, reaching 500,000. Projecting this monthly rate of increase forward would result in a May 2025 figure around 509,000, well below the 550,000 threshold. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' the rate of inventory accumulation would need to accelerate dramatically, requiring an increase of over 50,000 in a single quarter, which is a high bar.\n\nA 'Yes' scenario is plausible, likely driven by a negative demand shock, such as an unexpected rise in mortgage rates, causing sales to freeze while completed homes continue to enter the market. The 'surge' to a 17-year high indicates strong upward momentum.\n\nHowever, the 'No' scenario is more probable. Home builders are highly sensitive to rising inventory and are likely to respond by scaling back construction and offering incentives to clear existing stock, which would moderate inventory growth. A 10% inventory increase in just three months represents a significant market adjustment that is less likely than a continuation of the existing strong trend.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because the underlying conditions—high supply and affordability-constrained demand—are very real, making a continued sharp rise in inventory a distinct possibility. It is not higher because it assumes builders will act rationally to control inventory, preventing the kind of runaway accumulation required to hit the 550,000 mark so quickly.\n\nI would increase my probability on news of a significant drop in new home sales for March/April or further monetary tightening. I would decrease it on reports of widespread construction pullbacks or a notable drop in mortgage rates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
