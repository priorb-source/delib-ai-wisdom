    "review": "Both forecasters make the same core case I did: short horizon, federal inertia, FOIA/NARA/GSA processes, and the resolution-source nuance that a redirect or static notice still counts as UP. I found Forecaster 3’s mention of concrete technical signals (TLS expiration timing, DNS TTL/NS changes) a useful addition for monitoring. Forecaster 2’s explicit framing of single-checker risk and the possibility of targeted blocking is also a fair, if low-probability, concern. Neither presented compelling evidence for an accelerated full domain takedown by July 1, and both note precedent from 2017 that favors redirects/static pages over hard shutdowns. Overall, their reasoning aligns with mine and marginally strengthens the case for a slightly higher probability due to the phased savings target and the minimal effort to keep a domain responding.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is about 7 weeks. The site is currently up, and federal web decommissioning typically takes months with records and archiving steps. Even if the Energy Star program is eliminated, the most likely near-term web outcome is an archived or notice page, not DNS removal or a hard network block. The resolution method (IsItDownRightNow) only requires that energystar.gov respond; a redirect or static page suffices. Precedent from 2017 supports this pattern. New considerations from the other forecasters modestly tilt upward: the stated savings target is by 2026, suggesting a phased wind-down rather than a pre–July 1 hard cut, and the trivial cost of keeping a domain reachable argues against urgent takedown. I still reserve some probability for an aggressive symbolic takedown (DNS/NXDOMAIN or firewall) or an ill-timed outage/cert lapse precisely when Metaculus checks. Given these, I slightly raise my forecast from 88% to 90%.",
