    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize status quo inertia over a short horizon and the statutory basis of the DV program, which strengthens the case for continuity. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point that removing or materially altering a page for a legally mandated program is non-trivial administratively and legally, especially within six weeks—this slightly increases my confidence. Forecaster 3 highlights political volatility but, in my view, overweights the chance that an executive move would rapidly change web content before July 1; past precedent (opposition during prior administration without page removal) suggests otherwise. Both rightly flag technical/URL-structure risk; given the question’s specificity, an IA refresh or change to the slug is the main downside case. I find F2’s reasoning more persuasive overall; F3’s lower forecast seems cautious but not strongly supported by concrete near-term signals.",
    "rationale": "Short horizon (≈6 weeks), legal entrenchment of the DV program, and bureaucratic inertia make the page’s persistence very likely. Even if a hostile administration sought changes, rapid deletion or substantive alteration of this specific instructions page before July 1 is unlikely and could invite legal/process friction. The main residual risk is technical: a CMS/IA update that changes or deprecates this exact path, or modifies the page so it no longer contains the Step 1 instructions. USG sites typically preserve stable URLs or redirects, and the “on or after July 1” clause mitigates transient downtime. Balancing these, I slightly raise my estimate in light of the statutory argument and the difficulty of justifying removal while the program remains on the books, but keep a haircut for exact-URL risk and the possibility of content changes that strip the Step 1 instructions.",
