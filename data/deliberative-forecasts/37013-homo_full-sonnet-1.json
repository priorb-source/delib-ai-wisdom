    "review": "Both forecasters converged on 10%, presenting stronger cases than my initial analysis. Their key arguments: (1) Reform UK's 25% national polling vs Lib Dems' 14-16% suggests Reform is better positioned to capture Conservative losses, (2) the required swing means Lib Dems must triple/quadruple representation - a more striking framing than my 'more than double', (3) in local elections votes dissipate to independents and smaller parties rather than consolidating, and (4) Reform historically underperforms locally but still captures some seats. These are compelling points I underweighted. However, they may slightly underweight the local context: Cornwall has genuine Lib Dem historical strength (winning North Cornwall and St Ives in 2024), the £100k fundraising and near-full slate demonstrates real organizational capacity that Reform typically lacks locally, and local elections in Southwest England have shown Lib Dems consistently outperforming national polling. The absence of local polling data showing Lib Dem competitiveness is a significant negative indicator that supports their lower forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters make a strong case that Reform UK's superior national polling position (25% vs 14-16%) means Conservative collapse would split multiple ways, not primarily benefit Lib Dems. The mathematical requirement (gaining 17-22 net seats from 13 to reach 30-35) is indeed extraordinary and has no precedent. However, I maintain that local election dynamics matter: Lib Dems have infrastructure Reform lacks, recent Westminster wins demonstrate genuine Cornwall strength, and the party historically outperforms national polling in Southwest local elections. The combination of Conservative organizational weakness (leader retiring, multiple retirements), Reform's likely underperformance in local contests, and Lib Dem ground game creates more upside than 10% suggests, though less than my initial 15%. The absence of local polling showing Lib Dem competitiveness is the strongest evidence against a higher forecast.",
