    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning largely aligns with mine: the one-month horizon is short for a security-driven closure to reverse, and historical precedent suggests persistence. They add a useful emphasis on the multi-actor coordination (intelligence sharing, joint ops) typically required, reinforcing a low but non-trivial probability. Forecaster 3’s main point—status quo bias and the need for clear signals—is reasonable, but their claim of “less than 1 day remaining” is incorrect (there are about 31 days to July 1), which weakens their conclusion and likely leads them to set the probability too low. Neither added concrete new signals or reporting of talks; thus, the balance of evidence still favors No, but F2’s framing of the required intergovernmental steps nudges me slightly downward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about a month—tight for reversing a closure grounded in new militant activity, arms smuggling, and economic controls. Such closures often persist until authorities can both reduce risk and put visible controls in place (joint patrols, new inspection protocols, communications to local commands). We’ve seen no credible indications of high-level negotiations, joint security arrangements, or statements hinting at an imminent reopening. The credible-reporting requirement further lowers odds because a quiet, de facto easing wouldn’t count unless reported. Offsetting this slightly: economic pain for border communities, Nigeria–Benin interdependence, and the possibility of a selective or temporary reopening (e.g., limited hours or specific posts, potentially around Eid al-Adha in early June) that would still resolve Yes if credibly reported. Balancing these, I trim my forecast modestly to reflect the stronger security rationale and lack of signals without dropping to single digits given the possibility of a politically driven, selective reopening within the month.",
