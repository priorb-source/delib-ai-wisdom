    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical point that significantly affects my analysis: the Global Protest Tracker has NOT yet reported a qualifying event as of May 2, despite the April 5 and May 1 protests having occurred. This is crucial evidence I should have weighted more heavily. If these massive, well-publicized protests with 600,000+ aggregate participants haven't been added to GPT yet (or haven't been labeled with explicit 10,000+ figures), this reveals important information about either: (a) no single location actually reached 10,000+, (b) GPT's reporting lag is substantial, or (c) GPT's selectivity means they won't include these events. Forecaster 3's emphasis on GPT being the binding constraint—not merely whether protests occurred—is well-founded. The resolution requires GPT to explicitly report 10,000+, not just that such protests occurred. Forecaster 2's 95% confidence seems too high given this non-reporting, though their point about the scale of mobilization is valid. The average protest size of 60-88 participants from the Crowd Counting Consortium is also more damning than I initially weighted: even with 600,000 total participants across 1,200-1,400 events, getting 10,000+ at a single location requires an extreme outlier. However, I'm not going as low as 44% because: (1) two months remain for new events, (2) GPT may still backfill these events with explicit size data, and (3) the political environment suggests continued mobilization potential.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 65% to 52%. The most persuasive new evidence is that GPT hasn't reported these protests yet, which significantly reduces confidence that qualifying events have already occurred or will be documented. The fragmented nature of current protests (despite high aggregate numbers) makes 10,000+ at any single location less likely than I initially estimated. However, I'm not dropping to 44% because there remain multiple paths to YES: GPT could still add the April/May events with explicit 10,000+ labeling (reporting lag), or new large protests could occur in the remaining two months (especially around potential flashpoints like Supreme Court decisions in late June). The binding constraint is clearly GPT's inclusion and explicit size labeling, not just whether large protests occur. My forecast balances acknowledging this constraint while maintaining moderate confidence that either past events will be reported or future events will occur and be documented.",
