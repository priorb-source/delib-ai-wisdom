    "review": "New and useful points from the others: (1) a precise March 13, 2025 official license date in Chad, which tightens the relevant clock; (2) concrete license-to-availability lags in recent African launches (≈10–24 weeks), placing July 1 right in the plausible window; (3) the idea that the map can flip before full distribution is in place; (4) possible quarter-end batch updates; (5) a claimed Airtel Africa distribution partnership that includes Chad. I find (1)–(3) and (4) generally convincing and directionally supportive of a higher probability than my initial 35%. The Airtel claim could be material if confirmed, but I treat it with some caution absent corroboration. I also agree with their emphasis on status quo inertia and country-specific operational/regulatory friction that can push into Q3. Overall, their arguments justify an upward revision, but I’m not as high as 57–61% given the lack of visible pre-launch signals and the possibility that unresolved import/type approvals or pricing/FX issues remain.",
    "rationale": "Updating from 35% to 49%. The March 13 license timing means July 1 is ~16–17 weeks later—squarely within recent Africa activation lags (10–24 weeks). ISL capacity and neighboring activations suggest no technical blocker. The resolution hinges only on the map showing “Available,” which can precede full distribution, so minimal operational readiness could be sufficient. A late‑Q2 batch update is a plausible catalyst. Offsetting that, we’re ~6.5 weeks out with no clear precursors (type approvals, reseller announcements, pricing pages, or map ETA hints). Chad’s smaller market and potential customs/pricing/admin hurdles create meaningful slippage risk into Q3. Balancing a plausible Q2 flip against status quo inertia and absent signals, I land just below even odds. I would move up on any evidence of type approval/import clearance or a credible distribution announcement; I would move down on any sign of additional regulatory conditions or a revised map ETA into H2.",
