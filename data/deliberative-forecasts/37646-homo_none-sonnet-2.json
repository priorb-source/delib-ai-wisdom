    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. They correctly emphasize the gap between licensing and actual deployment - a critical point I underweighted. Their focus on Somalia's operational challenges (infrastructure limitations, security concerns, political instability) and the specific requirements beyond just regulatory approval (ground stations, local partnerships, payment systems) is well-founded. The consensus between them at 38-40% is notable and suggests systematic reasoning rather than coincidence. However, I notice that while Forecaster 3 acknowledges the question only requires website listing (not full service), both may be conflating deployment readiness with website updates. Starlink likely wouldn't list a country as 'Available' without operational readiness, but the bar might be lower than full nationwide coverage. Their emphasis on lack of deployment evidence is valid and concerning - the absence of news about ground stations or partnerships in the 47 days leading up to the deadline is meaningful.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward but not to the same level as the other forecasters. Key reasons for adjustment: (1) I overweighted the significance of Musk's announcement relative to actual deployment evidence - announcements are necessary but not sufficient; (2) The 47-day timeframe is more constraining than I initially assessed, especially given Somalia's infrastructure challenges; (3) Historical precedent shows meaningful lags between licensing and service availability that I didn't properly account for; (4) The complete absence of deployment signals (ground stations, partnerships, timeline announcements) is more concerning than I initially weighed. However, I'm not moving all the way to 38-40% because: (1) The license represents cleared regulatory hurdles, which are typically the major bottleneck; (2) SpaceX has demonstrated rapid deployment capability in other markets; (3) Mid-June still allows 2+ weeks for a website update if internal deployment decisions are made; (4) The question's threshold (website listing) is lower than full operational service. My updated forecast of 48% reflects increased skepticism about the tight timeline while maintaining that the license makes this scenario plausible though not probable.",
