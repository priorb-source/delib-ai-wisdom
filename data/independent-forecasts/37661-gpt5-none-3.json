    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Bangladesh is not shown as Available on the Starlink map yet, and absent a concrete launch/update it likely remains that way through June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite high-level political approval, formal licensing/landing rights or terminal type-approval takes longer than expected, or Starlink holds off on flipping the site to Available pending commercial arrangements or a coordinated launch. The map remains at Coming Soon/2025 through June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the reported final approval, the regulator issues the operative license and Starlink opens orders, leveraging laser backhaul without needing in-country gateways. Starlink updates the availability map to show at least some Bangladeshi areas as Available before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are ~45 days left. Starlink can sometimes move from approval to availability within weeks (e.g., select markets with political priority), but in many countries the lag is months due to licensing formalities, terminal approvals, commercial partnerships, and website update cycles. With limited time, inertia favors No.\n- Evidence/context: The cited report indicates Bangladesh’s leader gave “final approval,” which is a positive signal but may not equate to the operative spectrum/landing license and import/type approvals being fully issued. Bangladesh’s telecom environment is relatively regulated; additional steps (BTRC licensing, lawful-intercept/coordination, distribution) could stretch beyond June.\n- Operational feasibility: Technically, Starlink could serve Bangladesh via inter-satellite links and regional gateways once legally permitted, so a quick flip to Available is feasible if paperwork is done. That keeps the probability meaningfully above very low levels.\n- Why not higher: We lack confirmation that the license is executed, terminals are cleared for import/sale, and that Starlink intends an imminent commercial launch. The website often lags behind regulatory headlines.\n- Why not lower: The “final approval” headline suggests momentum and political will; Starlink has recently accelerated rollouts in parts of Asia once approvals land.\n- Update triggers upward: (1) Official BTRC announcement of license issuance/landing rights with dates; (2) Starlink or government press release about service launch/pilot, or terminals being deployed to public institutions; (3) Starlink map or order page showing “Available” or accepting addresses in Bangladesh.\n- Update triggers downward: (1) Reports of additional regulatory steps or conditions (e.g., local gateway mandates) delaying launch; (2) pushback from local telcos or security agencies; (3) lack of any licensing confirmation by mid-June.\n- Research assistant provided no additional information, so forecast leans on general rollout patterns and the limited time window.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
