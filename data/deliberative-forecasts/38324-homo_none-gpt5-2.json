    "review": "Forecaster 2 added the key point that the FRA 2023 suspension ended Jan 1, 2025, implying a reinstated ceiling and the likely use of extraordinary measures through mid-to-late summer (X-date), which would keep Total Public Debt Outstanding pinned near the Jan 2 level. That materially lowers the chance of hitting $37T by June 27 and is a consideration I only implicitly accounted for before. Forecaster 3 reasonably highlights the tail risk of a late-June ceiling resolution and rapid step-up from restoring extraordinary measures and rebuilding the TGA, but at 30% seems to overweight how much can move in three weeks and underweight mid-June tax receipts and the typical scale/timing of post-resolution catch-up. Overall, I find Forecaster 2’s logic more convincing; Forecaster 3’s pathway exists but is a lower-probability tail.",
    "rationale": "Key updates to my reasoning: \n- If the debt limit is binding (likely as of early June given common X-date estimates in mid-to-late summer), the reported Total Public Debt Outstanding is constrained near the Jan 2, 2025 level (roughly mid-$35T), making a rise to ≥$37T by June 27 effectively impossible absent an earlier resolution. \n- Even with an early/mid-June resolution, the immediate jump from restoring extraordinary measures plus a TGA rebuild is typically on the order of several hundred billion dollars, potentially approaching ~$0.7–1.0T over a few weeks in an aggressive scenario—still generally insufficient to move from ~mid-$35T to ≥$37T by June 27. Normal net borrowing over the remaining ~3 weeks would likely add only ~$100–250B. \n- Mid-June estimated tax receipts reduce near-term net borrowing needs, further dampening the pace of increase into late June. \n- A Yes outcome would require: (1) a near-immediate debt-limit resolution, (2) an unusually large and fast restoration/TGA rebuild and issuance schedule, and (3) a starting point already much closer to $37T than is plausible if the ceiling has been binding. \nGiven these, I keep a low probability but nudge it modestly higher than my initial 5% to reflect the small tail where a resolution happens very soon and Treasury moves exceptionally aggressively.",
