    "review": "After reviewing my fellow forecasters' analyses, I find their reasoning highly compelling and their lower probability estimates more accurate than my own initial forecast. Both correctly identified the immense institutional inertia of the FATF black list as the central factor. \n\nForecaster 2 made a particularly strong point that I had undervalued: the case of Russia. Despite Russia's suspension from the FATF following the invasion of Ukraine, the organization has not moved to place it on the black list. This is a powerful real-world example of the extremely high political threshold for adding a country, even under severe geopolitical strain. It suggests that the failure of a grey-listed country to meet its action plan—my primary justification for a higher probability—is highly unlikely to trigger such a drastic measure. \n\nForecaster 3 reinforced this by outlining how the FATF process is slow and procedural, correctly noting that a direct move to the black list from being off-list (in their hypothetical Pakistan example) is almost unheard of. This procedural rigidity applies equally to escalations from the grey list.\n\nBoth analyses convince me that I overestimated the likelihood of an addition to the list and that my initial 15% forecast was too high.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on the non-trivial possibility of a grey-listed country being escalated to the black list for failing to make sufficient progress. However, the deliberation with my peers has convinced me to substantially lower my estimate.\n\nThe core of my updated reasoning is the evidence-backed high bar for any changes to the black list. The other forecasters' arguments, particularly the example of Russia not being blacklisted despite its suspension, demonstrate that this is a measure of last resort, requiring a level of political consensus and non-cooperation that far exceeds simply missing deadlines on an action plan. The FATF's process is designed to be coercive but also encourages engagement; escalating a country from the grey list to the black list is a rare punitive step, and there are no strong signals that any country is currently on this path for the June 2025 plenary.\n\nThe probability of removals remains near zero. The political situations in North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar are fundamentally unchanged and do not support any expectation of the systemic reforms required for delisting.\n\nTherefore, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome rests almost entirely on the slim chance of a surprise addition. Given the strong evidence for FATF's institutional inertia and high political bar for change, I am reducing my forecast significantly to align with the more realistic low-single-digit probabilities proposed by my colleagues. A 4% chance reflects the remote possibility of a sudden geopolitical event or a catastrophic breakdown in a country's AML/CFT regime surprising the international community.",
