    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete downside risks I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: immediate April tariff shock, quick retaliation, and a cited 45% YoY drop in China→US bookings plus PMI contraction. I don’t find the shipping-bookings point very probative for this question because it speaks mainly to US imports from China, not US exports; the linkage to US exports is via retaliation, which may not fully bite within April. PMIs below 50 also signal softness but don’t necessarily translate into a one-month nominal export drop large enough to push totals below last April. Still, the combination raises the tail risk of an unusually weak April goods print. Forecaster 3 contributes a useful data point: March 2025 goods exports at $180.8B (+6.8% YoY), consistent with my base case that the level is comfortably above the April 2024 threshold when services are added. Their services range (70–85B) looks low; recent services exports are typically closer to ~90–100B, which makes clearing the $262.6B bar easier. Their caution about tariff timing is reasonable. Overall, F2’s argument justifies trimming a very bullish prior, but doesn’t warrant moving anywhere near their 15%, given composition (services), lags, and the modest size of the threshold gap versus recent levels.",
    "rationale": "Anchor remains that recent totals (Feb 2025 $278.5B; March goods $180.8B) imply a comfortable buffer over April 2024’s $262.6B when adding services. Services exports are relatively steady and less tariff-exposed, likely near ~90–100B, which stabilizes totals. For a No, April would need a sharp, immediate contraction in goods and/or services to pull totals under $262.6B—plausible only if retaliation depressed exports quickly across multiple partners and if other negatives (e.g., aircraft deliveries, energy prices) compounded. Forecaster 2’s evidence increases this downside risk, but key elements (China→US shipping bookings) are more indicative of imports, not exports, and retaliation often phases in with some lag. PMIs signal cooling but don’t guarantee a large one-month nominal drop. Forecaster 3’s March goods strength and YoY trend support a Yes base case. Given the new tariff shock and potential for rapid retaliation to dent goods exports to China and a few sectors in April, I’m trimming my prior 85% to reflect higher left-tail risk, but I still see the most likely outcome as a Yes due to (1) services stability, (2) recent export levels well above the bar, and (3) typical inertia in monthly totals.",
