  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.\n\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month. The question resolves after the FATF Plenary in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No jurisdictions are added to or removed from the FATF 'black list', meaning the list continues to consist of only North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the June 2025 plenary meeting, the FATF announces no changes to its list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action'. The list remains North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF announces a change to the list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action'. For example, due to geopolitical pressure related to the war in Ukraine, FATF members could reach a consensus to add Russia to the list.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of inertia associated with the FATF 'black list'. Changes are infrequent and typically require major, long-term shifts in a country's geopolitical standing or its commitment to AML/CFT reforms.\n\nFirst, considering removals, the three currently blacklisted jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) are highly unlikely to be removed. North Korea and Iran have been on the list for a long time and remain largely isolated from the global financial system, with no indications of the fundamental political and technical changes required for delisting. Myanmar was added in October 2022 following a military coup, and its political situation remains unstable, making significant progress on its action plan by June 2025 improbable.\n\nSecond, considering additions, the most discussed candidate is Russia. While its FATF membership has been suspended since February 2023, it has not been blacklisted. Adding a G20 economy and UN Security Council permanent member to the black list would be an unprecedented and geopolitically charged move with significant global financial ramifications. FATF, which operates on consensus, has so far stopped short of this step, as reaffirmed by the decision in February 2025 to maintain the suspension without escalation. While possible, blacklisting Russia remains a low-probability event that would likely require a major new catalyst.\n\nOther countries mentioned in the research, such as those on the 'grey list' (e.g., Nigeria) or those facing new scrutiny (e.g., Pakistan), are not at immediate risk of being moved to the black list. The process typically involves a prolonged period on the grey list with a demonstrated failure to address deficiencies, which is not the current situation for these nations.\n\nTherefore, the overwhelming likelihood is that the status quo will prevail. My probability is not lower than 10% to account for the small but non-zero tail risk of a major geopolitical event forcing a consensus to add Russia to the list. My probability is not higher because of the significant political and economic barriers to changing the list, as demonstrated by the FATF's actions over the past year. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a unified push by key FATF members to blacklist Russia. I would decrease it upon signs of de-escalation or statements reaffirming that the current suspension is a sufficient measure.",
