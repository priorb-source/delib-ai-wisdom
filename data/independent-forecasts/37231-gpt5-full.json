  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–6 weeks (Trading Economics typically posts Mexico’s April 2025 unemployment in late May or early June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — under 3% (recent months have been well below 3%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, immediate tariff-driven shock hits formal manufacturing employment in April (e.g., temporary shutdowns/layoffs at auto and steel plants), and the series Trading Economics uses (potentially seasonally adjusted) jumps to 3.0–3.3%. Alternatively, TE reports/rounds the April rate to 3.0%, which fails the “less than 3.0%” criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Labor market tightness persists and any tariff impact is absorbed via reduced hours/underemployment or shifts into the informal sector. April prints in the 2.2–2.8% range, continuing recent lows, and Trading Economics reports it as <3.0%.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and status quo: The research assistant notes Mexico’s unemployment at a historic low 2.2% in March 2025 (from 2.5% in Feb). With a very large informal sector (54.4%) and rising underemployment (6.6%), labor market stress tends to show up first outside the headline unemployment rate. A one-month jump from 2.2% to ≥3.0% would be unusually large.\n- Tariff shock timing: The AP background and the assistant’s report indicate significant new U.S. tariffs (25% on autos, steel, plastics). While negative, labor market adjustments typically lag, especially in Mexico where firms often cut hours, shift to informality, or delay hiring before outright layoffs. That makes an April spike above 3% less likely, though pressure could build later in 2025.\n- Forecasts: The IMF projects 2025 weakness and higher unemployment (to ~3.8%), implying deterioration over the year rather than instantaneously in April. The OECD is less bearish. Even if these prove right, April is early for the full impact.\n- Series/measurement risk: The main downside risk is not the real economy in April but which series Trading Economics uses (seasonally adjusted vs. not) and rounding/threshold effects. If TE shows 3.0% exactly, the question resolves No. If TE’s series has been hovering near 3.0% recently (contrary to the RA’s 2.2% for March), that would materially change the odds.\n- Why not higher than 85%: Nontrivial risks from (1) TE series choice/rounding; (2) potential concentrated layoffs in autos/steel that hit formal unemployment quickly; (3) data revisions. These could push April to 3.0%+ or get reported as 3.0%.\n- Why not lower than 85%: The latest point estimate (2.2% Mar) is far below 3.0%, and Mexico’s labor market has been tight for months. A ≥0.8 pp jump in one month is unlikely, and informality cushions headline unemployment.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports of significant April layoffs or shutdowns in major manufacturing hubs; TE currently showing March at or above 3.0% (implying a different series than the RA cites); signals that the April print will be rounded to 3.0% on TE.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation that TE is mirroring the low INEGI print (e.g., March <3% on TE), or early April labor indicators/business surveys showing stability; evidence that tariff implementation/take-up was slower than expected for April.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
