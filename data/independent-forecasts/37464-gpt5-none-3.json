    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall page remains listed as Active on or after June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS continues recall effectiveness checks or administrative verification, or there are minor follow-up actions (e.g., additional consignee checks or paperwork) that keep the listing in Active status through June, even though product is long off the market.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given the small, localized distribution and short shelf-life of a ready-to-eat wrap, FSIS completes effectiveness checks and updates the status to Closed in May, and the webpage reflects “Closed” before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing/base rates: The recall was posted Feb 24, 2025. By June 1 it will be ~97 days old. Many FSIS recalls, especially limited-scope/perishable ones, close within 2–4 months, but a nontrivial fraction remain Active longer due to verification and administrative lag. A rough base-rate model suggests a substantial chance of closure by ~3 months, but not overwhelmingly so.\n- Case specifics pushing higher: This appears to be a limited distribution (vending machines in Washington) of a highly perishable ready-to-eat wrap. Such items age out quickly; firms can often account for product and complete consignee checks relatively fast. That supports the possibility of closure by late May.\n- Factors pushing lower: FSIS closures can lag even after the practical risk window has passed, especially if there are follow-up checks or minor scope clarifications. Undeclared allergen recalls (fish) are often Class I, which can entail more thorough verification. With only ~3.5 weeks left, status quo inertia matters: if the listing is still Active now, the hazard of closure within the next ~3 weeks is modest.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was available (no confirmation of a status change). That leaves me weighting the status quo outcome more heavily.\n- Why not higher? Because many FSIS recall pages remain Active past three months for administrative reasons; with ~24 days left, the probability of the status flipping in that window is not dominant.\n- Why not lower? The product’s short shelf-life and narrow distribution support faster wrap-up; for small recalls, closure within ~3 months is common enough to keep probabilities near the mid-range.\n- What would update me upward: Any FSIS update indicating effectiveness checks completed, a firm/FSIS press note about closure, or the recall page showing decreasing outstanding consignee counts or a posted Close date. \n- What would update me downward: Any expansion of the recall, additional products or states implicated, reports of illnesses prompting extended verification, or signs of delayed firm responses/records that commonly prolong Active status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
