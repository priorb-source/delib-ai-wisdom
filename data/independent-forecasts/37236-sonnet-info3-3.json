  "information": "Total US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 5-6 weeks after the month ends, so April 2025 data should be released around early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - exports exceed the April 2024 threshold of $262,578 million",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs trigger substantial retaliatory measures from major trading partners in March-April 2025, causing US exports to collapse. Companies that front-loaded exports in February to beat anticipated tariffs see orders dry up in April. Combined with dollar strength and deteriorating global trade conditions, April 2025 exports fall below $262,578 million despite historically strong seasonal patterns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite trade tensions, April 2025 exports remain elevated. The February 2025 level of $278.5 billion provides a substantial cushion of about $16 billion above the April 2024 threshold. While trade policy uncertainty creates headwinds, the deterioration is not severe enough to erase this 6% margin. Global demand remains reasonably stable, and any front-loading effects in February are offset by continued baseline export strength.",
    "rationale": "The key insight is that February 2025 exports at $278.5 billion already exceed the April 2024 threshold of $262.578 billion by approximately $16 billion (6%). For a No outcome, April 2025 exports would need to fall significantly from this February baseline. While the background mentions Trump's tariffs and the Atlanta Fed noting trade subtracted 3 percentage points from Q1 GDP, historical patterns strongly favor exports: 79-93% of Aprils show year-over-year gains. The February data point is crucial - it suggests the bar has been cleared with meaningful room to spare. However, I'm not more bullish because: (1) the tariff situation could have triggered retaliatory measures that accelerate in March-April, (2) there may have been front-loading of exports in February ahead of tariff implementation, creating an April trough, and (3) trade was already a meaningful GDP drag in Q1. I'm not more bearish because it would require a collapse of 6%+ in just two months to fall below the threshold, which seems unlikely without catastrophic trade disruptions. The data would need to show either severe March-April deterioration or evidence that February was an anomalous spike to shift my forecast meaningfully lower. Conversely, confirmation of stable or rising export trends in preliminary March data would push my probability higher.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
