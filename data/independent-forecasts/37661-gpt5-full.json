  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~45 days (until June 30, 2025, end of day local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, Bangladesh does not show as Available on Starlink’s map, and absent further changes it will remain No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BTRC takes longer than expected to approve Starlink’s tariff plan and commercial terms; SpaceX delays flipping availability pending pricing/tax setup, local payment integration, or further regulatory clarifications (e.g., lawful intercept, spectrum use, or import logistics). Political noise from the U.S. investigation prompts a go‑slow approach, pushing public availability into July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within weeks, BTRC approves tariffs and any remaining filings; Starlink enables Bangladesh in its ordering system and map, at least for parts of the country, leveraging inter-satellite links without a local gateway. Early customers or institutions begin placing orders; the map shows “Available” in at least one Bangladeshi region before July 1.",
    "rationale": "What I’m weighing:\n- Regulatory status (supportive): Per the assistant’s report, BTRC granted two 10‑year licenses on Apr 30, 2025, and import permission is included. A public trial occurred Apr 9. Officials and SpaceX have publicly targeted a May 2025 launch. These are strong signals that the main policy hurdle (licensing) is cleared and operational readiness is advanced.\n- Remaining gate (pricing/tariff approval): Reports indicate Starlink is preparing a tariff plan for BTRC review. In many markets, listing “Available” coincides with approved pricing/tax and the ordering system going live. The timing of this approval is the key uncertainty. Reviews can be quick (weeks) or stretch longer, especially if price levels or consumer protections are scrutinized.\n- Infrastructure needs: Bangladesh can be served via laser-linked satellites without waiting for a local gateway, removing a common bottleneck. That supports a faster timeline once commercial terms are approved.\n- Typical rollout cadence: Historical lags from license to ‘Available’ have ranged from <3 months to >1 year. Bangladesh appears closer to the faster end due to government enthusiasm, a completed trial, and explicit near-term launch targets.\n- Political probe risk: The mid-May call by U.S. senators for a federal investigation could create optics concerns but is unlikely to directly impede BTRC’s process after licenses were granted. Still, it adds some chance of a cautious delay.\n\nStatus quo weighting: Today the map does not show Bangladesh as Available; the base case without further action is No. However, given licenses, trial, and stated May launch aims, I expect further action is likely within the next 4–6 weeks.\n\nWhy not higher: Tariff/pricing approval and local commercial setup (payments, taxes, distribution) can easily slip past June. Bangladesh’s regulatory processes and any lawful intercept or consumer pricing reviews could add weeks. Musk/SpaceX timelines often slip.\nWhy not lower: Licenses are granted, imports allowed, a trial completed, and both government and SpaceX have near-term launch rhetoric. Technically, service can start without a local gateway. These factors meaningfully raise odds above 50%.\n\nWhat would move me up: Public BTRC approval of Starlink’s tariff; official Starlink Bangladesh pricing published; evidence of order pages accepting Bangladeshi addresses; media reports of institutional customers onboarding; sightings of the map briefly showing availability or a Starlink country page going live.\nWhat would move me down: News of additional regulatory prerequisites (e.g., mandatory local gateway, extended tariff review), payment/tax integration holdups, or governmental re-evaluation tied to the U.S. investigation; any indication SpaceX is prioritizing other markets before Q3.\n",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
