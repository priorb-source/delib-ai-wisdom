    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever activity remains regionally concentrated and manageable; CDC continues recommending vaccination and bite-avoidance without advising against nonessential travel. Other circulating diseases (e.g., dengue) stay at Level 1–2 guidance only. No major capacity constraints or explosive spread triggers a higher notice.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, widespread escalation of yellow fever (or another serious health threat) occurs across multiple regions with significant traveler exposure and constraints on prevention (e.g., vaccine shortages), prompting CDC to issue a Level 3 (“Avoid nonessential travel”) notice for Colombia before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: CDC currently lists Colombia at Level 2. CDC Level 3 (Avoid nonessential travel) notices are rare and typically reserved for severe, widespread, and acute risks (e.g., Ebola, early COVID). Historically, yellow fever—even during notable outbreaks—is usually addressed with Level 1–2 notices and strong vaccination guidance rather than Level 3, because an effective vaccine exists.\n- Timeframe: Only ~5½ weeks remain. Moving from Level 2 to Level 3 within that window would require a marked deterioration: broad geographic spread, clear traveler risk, and/or constraints that materially reduce the effectiveness of standard precautions (notably vaccine access). That combination is possible but uncommon.\n- Signal from news: Reports mention an economic emergency tied to a yellow fever outbreak threatening tourism and agriculture. While concerning, media characterizations often outpace the specific CDC threshold for a Level 3. CDC would need epidemiological evidence indicating travelers face substantial risk despite precautions.\n- Status quo weighting: Given CDC’s conservative use of Level 3 for countrywide notices and the presence of an effective vaccine, the base case is that Colombia remains at Level 2 through June 1.\n- Why not higher: Level 3 for yellow fever in a major destination is unusual; vaccine plus targeted guidance typically suffice. Short time horizon further suppresses odds.\n- Why not lower: There is some elevated risk given reported outbreak signals and seasonality of arboviral diseases in the region; if spread accelerates or vaccine supply tightens, CDC could act quickly.\n- What would change my view upward: PAHO/WHO emergency grading increase, rapid case growth across multiple departments including urban/peri-urban areas, evidence of urban transmission, significant YF vaccine shortages or distribution failures, or a US Embassy/CDC health alert foreshadowing a Level 3.\n- What would change my view downward: Reports of containment, stable/declining incidence, adequate vaccine supply and coverage, or CDC updates reaffirming Level 2 with targeted regional guidance.\n- Research assistant info: None provided beyond links; thus the forecast relies on historical CDC practice and general outbreak dynamics rather than new, specific epidemiological data from April 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
