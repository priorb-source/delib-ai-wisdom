    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until June 30, 2025; resolves on any US bankruptcy petition filed before July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operating while managing costs and cash, completes additional debt repurchases or exchanges if needed, and faces no imminent maturities or defaults that force a filing before July 1. They may announce more restructuring or strategic alternatives, but no Chapter 11/7 petition is filed in the US in this window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity shock emerges—e.g., an unexpected legal judgment, a missed payment leading to acceleration, a failed near-term refinancing/exchange, or suppliers/partners pull terms—prompting Chegg to file a US bankruptcy petition before July 1 to manage liabilities and operations.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. With roughly two months left, large capital-structure events usually telegraph in advance (missed payments, forbearances, going‑concern flags, retention of restructuring advisors, exchange offers). Absent such signals, last‑minute filings are uncommon for companies without imminent hard maturities.\n- Status quo/inertia: As of late 2024 public information, Chegg still had meaningful cash and had been retiring portions of its convertible notes at a discount, reducing near‑term pressure. While the business has been under heavy competitive and revenue pressure from AI tools (per the WSJ piece), it was still generating positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in periods of 2023–2024, and had been proactively cutting costs. That setup makes a filing in the next 8 weeks unlikely unless a new shock appears.\n- No additional new intel: The research assistant provided no fresh data. Given that, I lean on the conservative base rate for abrupt bankruptcy filings in a two‑month window for a declining but cash‑holding tech-enabled services company with converts but limited covenant pressure: low single digits.\nWhy not higher: There’s no known near‑term maturity cliff within the next 8 weeks, converts typically carry de minimis coupons, and Chegg has a track record of repurchasing debt and cutting costs. Inertia plus short window argues against a filing.\nWhy not lower: Tail risks remain—e.g., an unforeseen judgment, data/security incident, a failed exchange if a hidden maturity exists, or the company hiring restructuring counsel and rapidly pivoting to a prepack. Also, if cash has fallen faster than expected and vendors tighten terms, a surprise filing is possible.\nWhat would move me up: Any of the following before July 1—8‑K noting going‑concern language; missed/extended payment on any debt; notices of default/acceleration; announcement of retention of major restructuring advisors (Kirkland & Ellis, Weil, A&M, PJT, Evercore) specifically for balance‑sheet work; exchange offers that fail or are withdrawn; disclosure of an adverse ruling or large settlement that stresses liquidity.\nWhat would move me down: Confirmed cash/liquidity runway into 2026; further discounted debt repurchases or refinancings completed; asset-sale proceeds bolstering cash; better‑than‑expected earnings/cash flow; explicit guidance ruling out near‑term filing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
