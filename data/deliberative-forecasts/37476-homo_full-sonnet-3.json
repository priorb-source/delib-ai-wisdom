    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at a 10% forecast, which suggests strong convergence on the key factors. Forecaster 2 added useful detail by calculating the quarterly burn rate (~$20M) to show several quarters of runway remain. Forecaster 3 made a compelling base rate argument - even severely distressed public companies rarely file bankruptcy within any given 2-month period. Both emphasized that bankruptcy is typically a last resort after exhausting alternatives like refinancing, asset sales, or equity raises. These are strong points I had implicitly considered but not explicitly detailed. The argument that management is still behaving as if they have options (implementing cost cuts, releasing products) is persuasive evidence against imminent bankruptcy. However, I remain concerned about the extreme current ratio of 0.5, which suggests current liabilities roughly double the cash position - implying significant near-term obligations around $566M. This creates vulnerability to unexpected shocks even with positive net cash.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing all analyses, I maintain that the 53-day window heavily favors No. The convergence at 10% across all forecasters reflects the tension between two realities: (1) GoPro is severely distressed with catastrophic metrics, but (2) has sufficient liquidity and no immediate forcing events to trigger bankruptcy before July 1. The positive net cash position, lack of debt maturity until November, and management's active cost-cutting efforts provide a buffer. The May 12 earnings report remains the critical near-term catalyst - if results show accelerating cash burn or unexpected covenant issues, the probability would increase. However, even catastrophic earnings would likely require weeks to exhaust alternatives before filing. The base rate argument is particularly compelling - the historical frequency of public companies filing bankruptcy within any specific 8-week period is low, even among distressed firms. The 0.5 current ratio and massive losses keep this from being lower, but the narrow timeframe and lack of immediate triggers prevent it from being higher.",
