  "information": "Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The agreement will NOT be cancelled before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue to focus on renegotiating price and capacity terms rather than outright cancellation. The debt blockage remains unresolved, preventing contract termination. Neither Bulgaria nor Turkey formally announces cancellation before the deadline, maintaining the status quo of renegotiation efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Bulgaria or Turkey makes a unilateral announcement of cancellation despite ongoing negotiations. This could occur if: Bulgaria's financial situation with Bulgargaz becomes untenable forcing emergency action; Turkey cancels due to non-payment; or political pressure leads to a rushed decision to terminate the agreement regardless of the debt settlement requirement.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. As of May 2, 2025 (approximately 5 weeks ago), bilateral talks were focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than cancellation - a crucial signal about the actual direction of negotiations versus public rhetoric. Three major structural barriers exist: (1) Former Deputy Energy Minister Stankov stated termination is blocked until debt is fully settled, (2) Turkey publicly opposes cancellation and views Bulgaria as a strategic partner, and (3) only 25 days remain until the resolution date. While Prime Minister Borissov made strong public statements about needing out of the deal and Bulgargaz faces bankruptcy concerns, major international contract cancellations typically require extended negotiations, debt resolution, legal processes, and mutual agreement or clear force majeure conditions. The gap between Bulgaria's public rhetoric and actual negotiation focus (renegotiation vs cancellation) suggests a lower probability of sudden cancellation. My forecast is not higher because unexpected political developments can occur, unilateral cancellations are possible under the resolution criteria (even if disputed), and financial pressures could force emergency action. My forecast is not lower because Bulgaria has clearly expressed desire to exit, genuine financial stress exists, and 25 days is technically sufficient for an announcement if political will emerged from either side. I would revise upward if: reports emerged of imminent debt settlement, Turkey showed signs of agreeing to cancellation, or new financial crisis at Bulgargaz forced immediate action. I would revise downward if: additional reports confirmed ongoing normal renegotiations or explicit statements were made about continuing the agreement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
