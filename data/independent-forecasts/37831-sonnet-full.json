  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the political parties remain dissolved",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The military junta maintains its decree dissolving all political parties, dismisses or controls the legal challenges filed in courts, suppresses domestic opposition through arrests and intimidation, and ignores international condemnation. The government proceeds with drafting new restrictive legislation for the political sector while consolidating authoritarian control.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing overwhelming domestic protests, successful legal challenges in multiple courts, severe international sanctions, or internal fractures within the military leadership, the junta reverses the decree and announces that political parties can operate again or that new parties can be freely formed under previous or new reasonable regulations.",
    "rationale": "The decree dissolving all political parties was issued only 9 days ago (May 13, 2025), and military juntas historically resist reversing major authoritarian decisions, especially so quickly after implementing them. Several factors strongly favor the status quo: (1) Mali has already withdrawn from ECOWAS, demonstrating willingness to defy regional pressure; (2) The junta has arrested opposition members, showing readiness to suppress dissent; (3) Military regimes typically control or ignore judicial challenges; (4) The 40-day timeframe until July 1 is extremely short for such a fundamental policy reversal. The government justified the dissolution as necessary for 'national unity' and 'rationalization,' suggesting this was a carefully planned long-term strategy rather than an impulsive decision. However, the probability is not zero because: (1) Legal challenges have been filed in six courts plus the Supreme Court, creating multiple pressure points; (2) UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and major international organizations have publicly called for reversal; (3) There is documented domestic opposition from intellectuals and civil society; (4) Unexpected economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation could theoretically force reconsideration. The forecast is not higher because authoritarian regimes rarely capitulate to pressure within weeks, and Mali has shown it can withstand international criticism. The forecast is not lower because legal systems can occasionally surprise, and mass protests or economic crises could emerge rapidly. To revise upward, I would need to see: major protests, successful court rulings, or credible reports of junta fracturing. To revise downward, I'd need evidence the junta is further consolidating power or systematically dismantling opposition.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
