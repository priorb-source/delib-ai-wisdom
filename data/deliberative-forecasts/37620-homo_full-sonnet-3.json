    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a very low probability (7-12%), which is reassuring and reflects strong consensus on the key factors. We all identify the same critical evidence: the established pattern of false alarms (2016, 2020, 2022), the 20-day timeframe constraint, Putin's supportive rather than accepting response, and Kadyrov's May 12 walkback. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point I underweighted: the wartime context with 11,000 Chechen troops in Ukraine makes disruptive leadership transitions particularly unlikely, as Russia prioritizes regional stability during active military operations. This actually strengthens the case for status quo rather than change. Forecaster 3's reasoning is nearly identical to mine with only a 1% difference. All three of us appropriately identify that we would need concrete evidence like formal transition announcements or Putin accepting the resignation to update significantly higher. The narrow range (7-12%) and convergent reasoning across independent analyses increases my confidence that this probability range accurately reflects the available evidence.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing my analysis alongside the other forecasters reinforces my initial assessment. The wartime context raised by Forecaster 2 is an important consideration, but it actually strengthens rather than weakens the case for continuity - Russia would be especially reluctant to disrupt leadership in a strategically important region contributing significant forces to ongoing military operations. The pattern evidence remains overwhelming: three previous instances of similar statements (2016, 2020, 2022) with zero actual departures establishes this as ritualistic political behavior. Kadyrov's May 12 statement explicitly downplaying resignation rumors, combined with Putin's supportive but non-accepting response on May 7, indicates continuation rather than transition. The 20-day window remains extremely constraining for Russian administrative processes. While the health concerns and succession planning are real factors preventing me from going to 5% or below, they must be weighed against the strong base rate and recent evidence of walkback. My 8% appropriately captures 'very unlikely but not impossible given potential health crisis' and sits in the middle of the three forecasts, reflecting balanced consideration of all factors.",
