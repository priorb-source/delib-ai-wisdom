    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical claim I hadn't considered: that Laurent Gbagbo may already be disqualified from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction, with multiple sources allegedly confirming his current ineligible status. This is crucial because if true, the resolution criteria would already be satisfied. However, this directly contradicts Forecaster 3's assertion that 'none of the five specified candidates have been disqualified yet' and wasn't mentioned in my research assistant's report. This discrepancy creates significant uncertainty. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns more closely with my initial reasoning, noting the pattern of disqualifications but lacking specific evidence against these five candidates. The fundamental question is whether Forecaster 2's sources are accurate and current - if Laurent Gbagbo is indeed currently disqualified, this changes everything.",
    "rationale": "I must weigh Forecaster 2's specific claim against the silence from both my research assistant and Forecaster 3 on this matter. The fact that my research assistant didn't mention Laurent Gbagbo being currently disqualified is concerning - this would be highly relevant information. However, Forecaster 2 cites specific sources and a concrete legal basis (2018 BCEAO conviction). Even with uncertainty about the accuracy of this claim, it represents a major new consideration. I'll apply Bayesian updating: if there's even a 60% chance that Forecaster 2's claim is accurate, combined with the baseline 30% risk I originally assessed for disqualifications occurring in the next month, this substantially increases my forecast. The calculation: P(Yes) = P(Gbagbo already disqualified) × 0.90 + P(not disqualified) × 0.30. Assigning 60% confidence to Forecaster 2's claim: 0.60 × 0.90 + 0.40 × 0.30 = 0.66. I'm updating significantly upward to 65%, reflecting the substantial possibility that a disqualification has already occurred while maintaining uncertainty given the conflicting information.",
