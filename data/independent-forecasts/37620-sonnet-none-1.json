    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 19 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite Kadyrov's May 6th statement about wanting to step down, the formal transition process takes longer than 19 days, or he reverses course, or it was political posturing without immediate intention to act. Even if genuine, bureaucratic and political processes in Russia typically require substantial time for leadership transitions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's May 6th statement reflects a genuine and immediate decision to step down. Given the authoritarian nature of the Russian system, Putin approves and facilitates a rapid transition. A successor is quickly appointed and formally assumes the position before June 1st, with official announcements from credible Russian government sources confirming the change.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing a significant recent development against a very short timeframe. The May 6th Moscow Times report (just 6 days ago) about Kadyrov wanting to step down is highly relevant and increases the probability substantially above baseline. However, several factors suggest caution: (1) Only 19 days remain until the deadline - an extremely short window for formal leadership transitions even in centralized systems; (2) No evidence from the research assistant of actual transition procedures being initiated; (3) Statements about stepping down from authoritarian leaders don't always translate to immediate action; (4) Kadyrov has been a crucial Putin ally since 2007, and such strategic positions typically involve careful succession planning; (5) Even willing transitions in Russian politics usually involve behind-the-scenes negotiations and formal procedures that take weeks or months. The status quo strongly favors continuity - leaders rarely change within 3-week windows. While the recent statement is genuine news that elevates this above a 5-10% baseline, the compressed timeframe and absence of concrete transition steps being reported make a rapid resolution unlikely. I would update higher (40-60%) if credible reports emerged of formal succession processes actively underway, or if Putin made statements supporting an immediate transition. I would update lower (5-15%) if Kadyrov or Kremlin sources walked back or contextualized the statement as not indicating imminent change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
