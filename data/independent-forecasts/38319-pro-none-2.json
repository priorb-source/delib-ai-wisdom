    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days, with the announcement expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Following a large 7.6% month-over-month increase, the status quo would be a slight reversion or normalization, resulting in a flat or small negative change. This would be a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The significant production increase in March was a temporary 'catch-up' effect after two months of decline, possibly due to the fulfillment of backlogged orders. In April, production levels normalize, leading to a slight month-over-month decrease as the one-off drivers fade.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March surge was the start of a sustained recovery. Strong underlying demand, both domestically and from export markets, continues to fuel factory orders, leading to a further, albeit more modest, increase in production in April.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the typical behavior of volatile economic data like industrial production. The provided information indicates a large 7.6% MoM increase in March 2025, which followed two consecutive months of decline. Such a sharp increase is often followed by a period of normalization or a slight pullback, a statistical concept known as reversion to the mean. The March figure could represent a one-time correction or the fulfillment of delayed orders, rather than the beginning of a new, strong upward trend. Therefore, the base case or status quo points towards a flat or slightly negative reading for April, which would resolve the question as 'No'.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 45% because the momentum from a 7.6% increase is significant. There could be underlying sector strength (e.g., in semiconductors or automotive parts) that propelled the March growth and could easily carry over into April, resulting in a small positive print (e.g., +0.1% or more), which would be enough for a 'Yes' outcome. The binary nature of the question (>0.0%) makes a 'Yes' outcome plausible even without strong growth.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 45% because a single data point is insufficient to declare a new trend. The preceding two months of decline suggest underlying weakness or volatility that could easily resurface. Without further leading indicators for April, such as regional business sentiment surveys (PMI) or export order data, it is more prudent to expect a reversion to the mean than to extrapolate a single month's strong performance.\n\nI would increase my probability if leading indicators for April released after the fact (like trade data or PMI surveys) showed continued strength. I would decrease my probability if there were reports of disruptions, such as major factory maintenance or a sharp downturn in key export markets during April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
