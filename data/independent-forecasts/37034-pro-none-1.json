    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The dominant secular trend is a slow decline in the active rig count due to improved drilling efficiency, producer capital discipline, and industry consolidation. A continuation of this trend over the next five weeks would likely push the rig count below the 583 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of rigs is 583 or greater. This outcome would likely be driven by a significant and sustained rally in WTI crude oil prices (e.g., above $95/bbl) or a surprise recovery in natural gas prices. Such price movements would incentivize producers, particularly private ones, to halt rig reductions and potentially add rigs, causing the total count to stabilize or increase above the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number of rigs is less than 583. This outcome would occur if the current modest downward trend continues. Factors contributing to this would include major E&P companies realizing post-merger synergies by reducing redundant rigs, persistently weak natural gas prices forcing further deactivation of gas-directed rigs, or a dip in oil prices that dampens drilling appetite.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an extrapolation of key trends observed in the energy sector into the near future. The primary driver for the rig count since early 2023 has been a structural shift towards capital discipline and operational efficiency, which has exerted downward pressure on the rig count even amid relatively strong oil prices. I am assuming that as of today, April 23, 2025, these trends have continued, and the U.S. rig count is approximately 595, down from the low 600s seen in early 2024.\n\nTo resolve as 'Yes', the count needs to fall by at least 13 rigs over the next five weeks, an average of 2.6 rigs per week. This is a plausible rate of decline, consistent with recent historical volatility and the ongoing effects of M&A synergies (e.g., from the Exxon-Pioneer and Diamondback-Endeavor deals) and continued weakness in the natural gas market, which disincentivizes drilling in basins like the Haynesville.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (closer to 100%) because strong crude oil prices (WTI ~$80-90) provide a powerful floor, preventing a more rapid collapse in the rig count. A geopolitical event that sends oil prices soaring could easily reverse the trend and lead to a 'No' outcome. My forecast is not lower (closer to 50%) because the structural headwinds of efficiency gains and consolidation are persistent and unlikely to abate in the short term. The momentum is clearly biased towards a slow decline.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'No' if WTI prices break and hold above $95/bbl or if there are multiple consecutive weeks of rig count additions. I would update my forecast further towards 'Yes' if WTI prices fall below $75/bbl or if major producers announce further rig cuts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
