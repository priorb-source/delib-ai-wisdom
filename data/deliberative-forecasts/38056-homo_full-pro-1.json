    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that were entirely consistent with my own. We all identified the same crucial information: multiple credible news outlets have confirmed that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the fight due to injury, and an official replacement, Brendson Ribeiro, has been scheduled to fight Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. All three of us correctly noted that the explicit resolution criteria mean this situation leads to a 'No' outcome. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it is based on the same definitive evidence and logical application of the question's rules. No new arguments or evidence were presented that I had not already considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I find no reason to change my initial forecast. The consensus reinforces my confidence in the original assessment. The core facts remain undisputed: Johnny Walker has officially withdrawn from the UFC 316 bout against Azamat Murzakanov, and a replacement has been named. According to the resolution criteria, if this specific fight does not happen, the question resolves as 'No'. The current, confirmed situation makes this 'No' outcome a near certainty. I am maintaining my forecast of 1% because while the fight being reinstated is extraordinarily unlikely, forecasting best practice advises against assigning 0% to any event that is not a logical or physical impossibility. A bizarre series of events (e.g., the replacement fighter withdraws, Walker's injury was misdiagnosed, and the UFC re-books the fight) is not impossible, merely improbable to a very high degree. The unanimous agreement among all forecasters strengthens the argument that 1% is the appropriate probability for this tail-risk scenario.",
