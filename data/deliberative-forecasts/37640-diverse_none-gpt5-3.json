    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize short timelines, bureaucratic inertia, and that “up” includes redirects—points aligned with my initial view. New to me was the explicit mention of archiving/legal/process requirements (NARA/OMB-style obligations), which further supports persistence. Their main counterweight is the credible top-down directive to eliminate the program, which could drive a symbolic, faster takedown than usual. I find their reasoning generally convincing; however, neither presents concrete evidence of an imminent shutdown date or visible decommissioning steps for the domain. Overall, their arguments modestly increase my attention to the possibility of a political push for speed but largely reinforce a high-probability Yes.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~48 days. Status quo is the site is up and any reachable landing page or redirect counts as “up” per the resolver. Federal web and .gov domain decommissioning typically require coordination (records, notices, redirects, DotGov changes), making abrupt full domain retirement within weeks less likely. The announced elimination raises risk of an intentional, symbolic takedown, but absent a public shutdown date or observable DNS/hosting changes, inertia and archival obligations dominate. Residual risks keeping me below 90–95%: an executive directive to pull DNS quickly, a misconfigured transition causing downtime, or bad luck with a transient outage at the moment Metaculus checks. Net: I trim slightly to reflect the credible top-down risk but keep a high probability due to process friction and the permissive resolution criterion.",
