  "information": "Several large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Multiple large protests have already occurred that appear to meet the criteria",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker either does not report any of the multiple large protests that have already occurred (January 4 with 35,000, February 2 with 38,000-100,000, February 15 with 300,000, March 29 with 12,000 participants), or reports them with participant counts below 10,000, or excludes them based on other criteria. Additionally, no new protests with 10,000+ participants occur and get reported before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports any of the already-occurred large protests with 10,000+ participants (particularly the February 15 rally with 300,000, the February 2 protest with 38,000-100,000, the January 4 protest with 35,000, or the March 29 protest with 12,000). Alternatively, additional large protests occur in May or June 2025 and are reported by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports multiple protests in South Korea that clearly exceed the 10,000 participant threshold: January 4 (35,000), February 2 (38,000-100,000), February 15 (300,000), and March 29 (12,000). These protests are occurring in the context of a significant political crisis following a martial law declaration and impeachment proceedings, which explains their scale and frequency. The May 1 Labor Day rally potentially meets the threshold if police estimates of 13,000 are accurate. The critical uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker has reported or will report these protests. Given that: (1) the protests are exceptionally large and internationally significant, (2) they relate to a major political crisis that has drawn international attention, (3) the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker focuses on significant protest movements, and (4) there are still 2 months for either past protests to be added or new protests to occur and be reported, the probability of a YES outcome appears very high. Why not higher (95%+): There's inherent uncertainty about the tracker's reporting criteria, timing, and whether they will classify these specific events in a way that meets the question's requirements. The tracker might have reporting delays, different participant count methodologies, or may not have covered these events yet. Why not lower (75-80%): Multiple protests have already occurred with participant counts far exceeding the threshold (especially the 300,000-person rally), the political crisis continues to generate protest activity, and 2 months remain. It would require the tracker to systematically miss or misreport these major events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
