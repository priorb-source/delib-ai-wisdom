  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo continues to prioritize his duties as acting president and deflect questions about a potential candidacy. Citing low public support, prohibitive party registration deadlines, and respect for historical precedent, he allows the May 4 resignation deadline to pass without declaring a run for president.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bowing to intense pressure from a large faction within the People Power Party, who see him as the only viable conservative candidate, Han Duck-soo holds an emergency press conference in early May. He announces his candidacy, likely as an independent or after the PPP makes an extraordinary move to change its rules, framing his decision as a necessary step to ensure national stability.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence against a successful and timely campaign launch. The status quo is that Han Duck-soo is a non-candidate, and the barriers to changing this are substantial. \n\nFirstly, the procedural obstacles are immense. Han has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary, and the party leadership has publicly confirmed he will not be included. While a path as an independent or a last-minute rule change by the PPP exists in theory, these are highly unconventional and difficult routes. He is also required by law to resign by May 4, leaving an extremely narrow window for such a complex political maneuver.\n\nSecondly, public support for his candidacy is exceptionally weak. Polling data from April 2025 places his support between 2% and 12%, with one poll indicating 66% of respondents find his potential run 'unacceptable'. These figures do not suggest a viable path to victory or a groundswell of public demand for his leadership, which would be necessary to overcome the procedural hurdles.\n\nThirdly, there is a strong historical and constitutional norm in South Korea that discourages caretaker heads of state from running for the office they temporarily hold. Violating this norm would likely be met with significant public and political backlash. Finally, there is no observable evidence of campaign preparations, which is a critical indicator for a serious presidential bid.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 10% because there is a vocal and reportedly large faction of over 50 PPP lawmakers actively urging him to run. This organized internal pressure creates a non-zero chance that a desperate political calculation could lead to a last-minute announcement. Politics can be volatile, and this internal party dynamic is the primary factor arguing for a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nThe probability is not higher because the combined weight of missed deadlines, abysmal polling, historical precedent, and a lack of campaign infrastructure makes an announcement highly improbable. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of the PPP leadership reversing course and amending its primary rules, or a sudden, dramatic, and sustained surge in Han's public approval ratings.",
