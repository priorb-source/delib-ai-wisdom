    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9 days. 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end (March 31, 2025), which means the filing should be submitted by around May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The threshold of 2,382,000 shares appears to represent Berkshire's existing position from the previous quarter. The status quo would be that they maintain this position without adding to it, which would result in a No outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway maintains their position at exactly 2,382,000 shares or reduces their holdings during Q1 2025. They might have decided to pause after their initial stake purchase to observe the business, or they may have reallocated capital to other opportunities. The 13F shows holdings at or below the 2,382,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway increases their position during Q1 2025 to more than 2,382,000 shares. This would be consistent with Buffett's typical pattern of building positions over multiple quarters when he likes a business. Perhaps the investment committee saw continued value in Domino's business model and franchise strength, deciding to increase their stake during the January-March period.",
    "rationale": "The question asks if Berkshire will reveal they purchased MORE shares, with the baseline appearing to be 2,382,000 shares from a prior filing. Without additional data from my research assistant, I must rely on general patterns of Berkshire's investment behavior. Historically, Berkshire often builds positions gradually over multiple quarters, but the majority of the time, positions don't change significantly quarter-over-quarter. The initial purchase mentioned in the article suggests interest in Domino's, which could support continued buying. However, several factors make me cautious about assigning high probability: (1) Most quarters, positions remain stable - the status quo typically prevails; (2) Berkshire is selective and patient, often establishing a position and monitoring before adding; (3) We have no recent news or reports suggesting additional purchases during Q1 2025; (4) Market conditions in Q1 2025 might have affected their decision-making. My forecast is not higher because there's no concrete evidence of additional purchases, and positions usually don't increase every quarter. It's not lower because Berkshire does sometimes build positions methodically, and the initial stake suggests genuine interest in the business. To revise upward, I would need: reports of unusual trading volume in DPZ, insider reports of Berkshire activity, or statements from Berkshire. To revise downward, I would need: negative news about Domino's Q1 performance, reports that Berkshire has shifted focus elsewhere, or market conditions that would have made adding less attractive.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
