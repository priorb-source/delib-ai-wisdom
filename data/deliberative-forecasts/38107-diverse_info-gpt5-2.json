    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short time window, the high legal bar for a true threat, the lack of concrete investigative steps (charges, warrants, grand jury), and the rarity of arresting a former FBI director. Forecaster 3 adds the specific 2023 Supreme Court standard (Counterman) requiring subjective intent/recklessness for threats, which tightens the legal hurdle. Forecaster 2 notes institutional caution and calls out low-quality sources, focusing weight on credible reporting. These points largely align with my priors; the Counterman citation is the main incremental argument I hadn’t explicitly named, and it supports a low probability. I also agree that the broad “any arrest, anywhere” wording sets a nonzero floor. I don’t see persuasive evidence of imminent legal action (no target letter, no warrant activity, no credible reports of a fast-moving case).",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~32 days. Fast-moving arrests of high-profile ex-officials on speech-related conduct are rare.\n- Current state: Secret Service interview, deletion of post, explicit disavowal of violent intent; no reported charges, warrants, or grand jury steps. Credible coverage (e.g., NYT) frames this as an inquiry, not imminent arrest.\n- Legal hurdle: Under Counterman v. Colorado (2023), prosecution for threats needs at least recklessness as to the threatening nature of the speech. A cryptic post plus a public disavowal makes rapid probable-cause development unlikely absent new evidence of intent.\n- Institutional/base-rate factors: Arresting a former FBI director is extraordinary; processes usually unfold slowly and cautiously, especially where First Amendment issues are implicated.\n- Floor from “any arrest, anywhere”: Nonzero but very small for an unrelated custodial event within a month for someone like Comey.\n- Net: The new arguments slightly reinforce the low baseline but don’t materially change it; I maintain a low single-digit forecast.\n- Would move up on credible reporting of charges, a warrant, grand jury activity, or new statements/actions by Comey that create clear probable cause. Would move down if the Secret Service/DOJ publicly close the inquiry or if we reach mid-June with continued quiet.\n",
