  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current Wikipedia page lists all seven countries as blocking X (Twitter). If this situation persists until the resolution date, the question will resolve as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if at least one of the seven countries officially lifts its ban on X before the resolution date, and the Wikipedia article is updated to reflect this change. For example, a significant political shift in one of the countries could lead to the new leadership unblocking social media platforms as a sign of reform.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome, the most likely scenario, is one where the governments of China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela maintain their existing internet censorship policies. With no major geopolitical shifts prompting a change, the Wikipedia page will continue to list all seven countries as currently blocking X on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My high confidence in a 'Yes' resolution is based on the short time frame and the deeply entrenched nature of internet censorship in the seven specified countries. \n\n1.  **Inertia and Status Quo:** The policies blocking X in these nations are not recent or temporary; they are long-standing components of state information control. The governments of China (since 2009), Iran (since 2009), North Korea, and Turkmenistan have maintained these blocks for over a decade. Russia, Myanmar, and Venezuela implemented their blocks in response to significant political events (the invasion of Ukraine, a military coup, and civil unrest, respectively), and the conditions that led to those blocks remain firmly in place. Over a short period of less than a month, the status quo is overwhelmingly likely to hold.\n\n2.  **Low Probability of Change:** For the outcome to be 'No', at least one of these seven authoritarian regimes would need to fundamentally reverse its policy on information control. Such a change would likely require a major catalyst, such as a regime change or a significant geopolitical realignment, none of which appear imminent for any of these countries within the next 26 days.\n\n3.  **Research Assistant's Report:** The information about Pakistan lifting its ban is a useful reminder that such blocks are not always permanent. However, Pakistan is not on the list, and its political system is distinct from the seven countries in question, most of which have more rigid censorship apparatuses. This event does not significantly change my assessment for the seven listed countries.\n\n4.  **Why the forecast isn't higher:** My forecast is not 99% or 100% because the question resolves to 'No' if even one country is removed from the list. This creates seven distinct, albeit low-probability, points of failure. An unforeseen 'black swan' event, such as the sudden collapse of a regime, could lead to a rapid policy reversal. I am assigning a cumulative 2% probability to such an event occurring in any of the seven countries and being reflected on Wikipedia before the deadline.\n\n5.  **Why the forecast isn't lower:** A lower forecast would imply a meaningful chance of one of these states reversing course in the immediate future. Given the stability of their censorship policies, a combined 98% chance that they all maintain their blocks for another month seems appropriate and perhaps even conservative. \n\nI would update my forecast downwards if credible reports emerged of major political instability or talks of lifting internet blocks in any of the seven countries. I would update upwards as the resolution date approaches with no such news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
