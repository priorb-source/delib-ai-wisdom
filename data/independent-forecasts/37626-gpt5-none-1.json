    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks (mid-June 2025 CPI/average price release)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent banana average prices have tended to be at or above $0.6300/lb; without an unusually large monthly drop, May 2025 is likely ≥ $0.6300.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Importers’ price hikes and elevated logistics costs persist; retail passes through costs; no major supply glut or currency boost. May 2025 posts around $0.64–$0.67, keeping the figure at or above $0.6300 (equal to $0.6300 would also be No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Freight/toll pressures ease, USD strengthens against Latin American currencies, and retailers run promotions amid ample supply, nudging the series down into roughly $0.61–$0.629 for May.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and inertia: The BLS banana average price series is historically stable with modest month-to-month moves. In recent years it has hovered in the low-to-mid $0.60s rather than the high-$0.50s seen pre-pandemic. Given that “Yes” requires strictly under $0.6300, the bar is slightly higher than it appears (a $0.6300 print is a No). Evidence/context: Media reports (e.g., Quartz) point to upward pressures from port fees/tolls and supplier price increases. While not definitive, they tilt risks upward rather than downward. Monthly volatility in this series is typically small, so crossing below $0.6300 in a single month is less likely unless the latest readings are already at or below that level. Information from research assistant: none beyond the prompt. Why not higher: Without clear signs of a recent sub-$0.63 print or a strong, recent easing in costs, the chance of May landing below $0.6300 is limited. Why not lower: The series is close to the threshold and can dip on promotions, currency moves, or improved logistics, so a sub-$0.63 print is plausible. What would raise my forecast: April 2025 BLS banana price at or below $0.6300; reports of easing Panama Canal constraints and lower Latin America–US freight rates; a stronger USD versus exporters’ currencies; supermarket promotion cycles for May. What would lower my forecast: April print clearly above $0.64; news of additional fees/tariffs or supply disruptions; signs of retailers maintaining higher price points in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
