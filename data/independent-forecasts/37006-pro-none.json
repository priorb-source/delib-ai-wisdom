    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The Canadian federal election must occur on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. In the 2021 federal election, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party won 10. The status quo is a significant seat advantage for the Bloc Québécois.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party, under Pierre Poilievre, experiences a historic surge in Quebec, capitalizing on national momentum. Their economic message resonates with voters outside of Montreal, allowing them to sweep the Quebec City region and make unprecedented gains in ridings in Saguenay, Mauricie, and Chaudière-Appalaches, ultimately winning more seats than a declining Bloc Québécois.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The political dynamics of the 2021 election largely hold. The Bloc Québécois successfully defends its francophone heartland by positioning itself as the sole defender of Quebec's interests. The Conservative's appeal remains confined to its traditional strongholds in and around Quebec City, preventing them from making the broad gains necessary to overcome the Bloc's substantial seat advantage.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural advantage held by the Bloc Québécois (BQ) and the historical difficulty the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) has faced in achieving a broad electoral breakthrough in Quebec. The starting point from the 2021 election is a 32-10 seat lead for the BQ, a massive gap for the CPC to close.\n\nThe BQ's support is concentrated among Quebec nationalist voters in francophone ridings, a base that has proven resilient and often insulated from national political tides. The party's performance is consistently strong in these areas. While the provided article mentions a potential Liberal surge under Mark Carney could harm the BQ, this scenario would likely benefit the Liberals more than the Conservatives, splitting the anti-BQ vote.\n\nConversely, the CPC's path to winning more seats than the BQ is narrow. It requires not only holding and expanding its base in the Quebec City region but also winning numerous seats in francophone areas where they have very little historical presence. The other article noting CPC candidate issues in Quebec City suggests their organizational strength, even in a core region, is not guaranteed. While the CPC is experiencing strong national polling, translating this into a seat count in Quebec that surpasses the BQ's is a monumental task that would require a fundamental political realignment in the province.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85 because a national Conservative landslide, as some polls suggest is possible, could have unpredictable effects. A strong 'blue wave' could lift the CPC in several marginal ridings, significantly narrowing the gap with the BQ. Pierre Poilievre's populist appeal may resonate more strongly than anticipated.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 85 because the 22-seat deficit is a very high barrier to overcome. The BQ is an established brand, and the CPC faces enduring challenges regarding its image on social issues and alignment with Quebec's values. For the outcome to be 'No,' the CPC would need a truly historic performance, an event which current province-specific data does not support as the most likely outcome. I would lower my forecast if multiple polls began showing the CPC with a clear and sustained lead in seat projections over the BQ in Quebec. I would raise it if CPC polling in the province stagnates or declines as the election nears.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
