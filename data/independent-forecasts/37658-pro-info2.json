  "information": "The merger proposal has encountered significant political and union opposition. The opposition is bipartisan in nature. Former President Donald Trump has also voiced his disapproval, stating he would not support the deal and that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake in U.S. Steel. He attributed U.S. Steel's strong position to tariffs he had implemented. Following these remarks on February 13, 2025, U.S. Steel's stock price declined by 1.9%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The merger agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel remains active, but the deal has not closed and is facing significant regulatory review and political opposition.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite political and regulatory headwinds, neither company files to terminate the agreement before July 1, 2025. They may choose to let the deadline pass or extend it while continuing to seek approval, meaning the merger has not officially collapsed within the question's timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing insurmountable political opposition and the high likelihood of a regulatory block, U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel concludes the deal is no longer viable and files an SEC Form 8-K before July 1, 2025, formally terminating the merger agreement.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant conflict between the deal's strategic logic and the powerful political opposition it faces. The status quo is that the merger agreement is still in effect, and deals of this magnitude have significant momentum. Both companies are heavily invested and would face costs for termination. However, the opposition is exceptionally strong and, crucially, bipartisan. As my research assistant noted, former President Trump has vowed to block the deal, and the current administration has also expressed serious concerns. This high-level political intervention, combined with staunch opposition from the United Steelworkers union, creates a very high probability that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will ultimately block the acquisition. The key uncertainty is the timing. This question resolves on July 1, 2025, which is a very short timeframe. My probability is not higher than 40% because companies facing such hurdles often attempt to delay and renegotiate rather than immediately terminate. It is plausible they will let the July 1 deadline pass while trying to salvage the deal through concessions or by waiting for the political climate to change, which would result in a 'No' outcome for this question. My probability is not lower than 40% because the political pressure is immense and may force the companies to conclude that there is no realistic path forward, leading them to cut their losses and terminate the agreement sooner rather than later to end the uncertainty. I would increase the probability of collapse if CFIUS or the DOJ formally recommends blocking the deal. I would decrease the probability if the companies announce a major concession that wins over the union, or if key political figures publicly soften their stance.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
