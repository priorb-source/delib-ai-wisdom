    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important new constraint I hadn't considered: the Data + AI Summit June 9-12. This actually further compresses the viable announcement window, as companies typically avoid S-1 filings around major company events. However, Forecaster 2's 22% seems too high given this constraint plus the January mega-round. Forecaster 3's 10% is more reasonable, correctly emphasizing the lack of preparatory signals. Both forecasters make valid points about the confidential S-1 announcement pathway - companies can announce confidential submissions on their news page, which would satisfy the resolution criteria. This is a scenario I considered but perhaps underweighted. However, many companies keep confidential submissions quiet until closer to the roadshow, as Forecaster 2 notes. The key disagreement is how to weight: (1) the extremely short timeframe now further compressed by the summit, (2) the massive January funding providing 18-24+ months of runway, (3) the CEO's explicit 'dumb to IPO this year' statement, (4) complete absence of preparatory signals or leaks. I find these factors more compelling than the theoretical possibility of a surprise announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward to 4% from 3%. Forecaster 2's point about announcing a confidential S-1 submission is valid and represents a more plausible pathway than a full public S-1 in this compressed timeframe. However, the Data + AI Summit June 9-12 that Forecaster 2 identified actually strengthens my low forecast - it further constrains the viable window to either before June 9 (~18 days) or after June 12 (~18 days). This makes the timeline even tighter. The core evidence remains overwhelming: the $15.25B funding round just 4 months ago provides massive runway and directly contradicts any urgency to IPO; the CEO explicitly called 2025 IPOs 'dumb'; there are zero credible signals of preparation; and the base rate of companies announcing IPOs within 5 months of mega-rounds is extremely low. While I acknowledge the confidential filing announcement pathway and respect that Forecasters 2 and 3 see more probability here, I believe they're underweighting the combination of recent massive funding, explicit CEO statements, and the new summit constraint. My 4% reflects: minimal probability for a surprise confidential S-1 announcement, acknowledgment of theoretical possibility, but strong conviction that the evidence points decisively toward No.",
