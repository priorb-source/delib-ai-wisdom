  "information": "Several DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No companies are dropped from the DJIA.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices Averages Committee views the recent stock performance of several components as short-term volatility rather than a sign of fundamental, long-term decline. They conclude the current list of 30 companies remains the best representation of the U.S. economy and make no changes before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Triggered by a combination of sustained poor stock performance and a significant negative business event, such as the major contract cancellations at IBM, the Averages Committee decides a component no longer represents its industry leadership. They announce a replacement in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the historical infrequency of changes to the DJIA. The Averages Committee prioritizes stability and long-term representation, and changes are rare, typically occurring every few years rather than months. The status quo, in which no companies are dropped, is therefore the heavily favored outcome, especially within the short ~2-month timeframe of this question.\n\nThe information provided by my research assistant highlights significant recent stock declines for companies like UnitedHealth Group, Nike, Walt Disney, Nvidia, and IBM. While concerning, short-term stock volatility is common and is not usually a primary trigger for removal unless it reflects a deep and permanent shift in a company's business prospects. The news about IBM losing government contracts is a slightly stronger signal, as it points to a fundamental business issue rather than just market sentiment. Companies like IBM or Boeing have been periodically cited by analysts as potential candidates for removal due to long-term performance challenges, which adds a small amount of risk.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because several companies are simultaneously showing signs of weakness, increasing the chance that the committee might consider at least one of them for a change. Furthermore, a non-performance-related corporate event, such as a major merger or spin-off, could unexpectedly force a change at any time.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the time frame is extremely short. The committee is unlikely to react to market events from March and April with a composition change by June unless the situation deteriorates dramatically and persistently. Without a major, unexpected catalyst, inertia is the most powerful force governing the index's composition.\n\nI would increase my forecast if one of the weaker companies announced a major restructuring, was acquired, or suffered another significant and fundamental business setback. I would decrease my forecast as the resolution date approaches without any such news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
