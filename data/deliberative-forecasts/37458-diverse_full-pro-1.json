    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identified the same core tension: a strong status quo of non-communication and public friction pointing towards 'No', versus the significant potential catalyst of the upcoming Geneva trade talks pointing towards 'Yes'. We also all noted the 'birthday summit' rumors as a secondary factor and the mutual-acknowledgment requirement as a key hurdle. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrored my own. Forecaster 3 introduced a particularly convincing point I had not explicitly weighed: the historical diplomatic pattern where leader-level calls often follow ministerial meetings to either endorse a breakthrough or de-escalate a failure. This provides a more concrete and plausible mechanism for how the Geneva talks could directly lead to a 'Yes' outcome within the short time frame. The tight clustering of our forecasts (25% to 32%) indicates a shared and well-calibrated view of the situation.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward slightly based on the deliberation. My initial forecast of 25% was heavily weighted by the strong status quo evidence: China's repeated denials of recent calls, President Trump's own statement on May 5 of 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi, and the high bar set by the mutual-acknowledgment clause. While I saw the upcoming Geneva talks as a potential catalyst, Forecaster 3's point about the historical precedent for leader calls following such meetings has convinced me to increase its weight. This diplomatic pattern provides a more structured and plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. A positive outcome in the Bessent-He talks could necessitate a leader call to formally bless an agreement, making it a logical next step rather than a Hail Mary. This slightly increases the probability of a call occurring and, crucially, of both sides being willing to acknowledge it. Therefore, I am moving my forecast from 25% to 29%. The probability remains well below 50% because the Geneva talks could easily fail, and the underlying diplomatic friction and the acknowledgment hurdle remain significant obstacles.",
