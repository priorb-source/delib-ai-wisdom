  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The festival is scheduled for June 25-29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kneecap is currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and is scheduled to perform.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the court hearing on June 18, either the band member is remanded in custody or given restrictive bail conditions preventing his attendance, or Glastonbury organizers remove the band from the lineup due to intense pressure from police, politicians, and media, citing security and reputational risks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court grants the band member bail without prohibitive restrictions. Glastonbury organizers, emphasizing the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' and their commitment to free expression, resist external pressure and allow the performance to go ahead as planned.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Kneecap are scheduled to perform. Normally, given the festival's history of embracing controversial and political acts, their inclusion would be likely to continue despite political blowback. However, the situation has fundamentally changed with the recent, highly significant development reported by my assistant: a member of the band has been formally charged with a terrorism-related offence under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000. This shifts the issue from one of controversial speech to a serious criminal matter involving a proscribed organization. The key event that will likely determine the outcome is the court hearing on June 18, just a week before the festival. A likely outcome of this hearing is that the band member is either remanded in custody or released on bail with conditions that prevent him from performing or travelling to the festival. Even in the event of unconditional bail, the pressure on Glastonbury organizers from the police, security services, and politicians will be immense. For a major event responsible for over 200,000 people, the security and reputational risks associated with hosting a performer on a terror charge are likely to be deemed unacceptably high, making a cancellation by the festival the most probable outcome. My forecast is not lower than 25% because there is a non-trivial chance that Glastonbury's organizers will make a strong stand on principle, particularly if they view the charges as politically motivated. The court could also impose minimal restrictions, leaving the decision entirely in the festival's hands. My forecast is not higher because a formal terrorism charge is an exceptional circumstance that transcends typical artistic controversy. The legal jeopardy for the band member is significant, and the duty of care and security considerations for the festival organizers will almost certainly outweigh their desire to host the band under these specific conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
