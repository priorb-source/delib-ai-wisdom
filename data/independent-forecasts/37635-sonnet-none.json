    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Milei currently leads with 61% approval versus Sheinbaum's 60%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum's approval increases or remains stable while Milei's approval declines due to public backlash against his austerity measures and economic reforms in Argentina. Alternatively, positive developments in Mexico boost Sheinbaum enough to overtake or tie Milei's rating.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or extends his narrow lead as his economic reforms begin showing positive results or as he successfully manages public messaging. Alternatively, Sheinbaum faces challenges that slightly depress her approval while Milei holds steady.",
    "rationale": "The current situation shows an extremely narrow 1-percentage-point lead for Milei (61% vs 60%). With only 1.5 months until resolution, I apply significant weight to the status quo, which slightly favors a Yes outcome. However, the margin is so thin that it falls well within typical polling fluctuations and could easily reverse. Both leaders are relatively new in their positions - Milei since December 2023 implementing radical economic reforms in Argentina, and Sheinbaum since October 2024 in Mexico. Milei's aggressive austerity measures create volatility in his approval ratings, while Sheinbaum has maintained relative stability. The short time horizon suggests dramatic shifts are unlikely, supporting the status quo, but the razor-thin margin means even minor changes in public sentiment, economic indicators, or political events could flip the outcome. My forecast is not higher because the 1-point lead is negligible and well within normal variation. It's not lower because the status quo does favor Yes and 1.5 months is insufficient time for major structural changes in approval. I would update higher if polling shows Milei's gap widening or Argentine economic indicators improving significantly. I would update lower if there are signs of social unrest in Argentina or particularly positive developments in Mexico.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
