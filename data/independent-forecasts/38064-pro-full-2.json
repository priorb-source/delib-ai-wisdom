  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current expectation, based on historical patterns and multiple financial data sources, is that the meeting will be held as planned on June 12, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop's official DEF 14A filing, when released, confirms a different date for the meeting (such as the June 2 date listed by Computershare), or the meeting on June 12 is adjourned due to technical failures without being fully completed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop's official proxy statement confirms the June 12, 2025 date, and the virtual annual meeting proceeds and is fully completed on that day without any adjournment or significant technical disruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of historical precedent, available data sources, and risk factors. The status quo suggests a 'Yes' outcome. GameStop's annual meetings are consistently held in early-to-mid June on a Thursday, a pattern that June 12, 2025 (a Thursday) fits perfectly. This date is also listed by multiple financial data providers like Bloomberg and Business Insider. Furthermore, after the highly public technical failure in 2024, it is overwhelmingly likely that GameStop and its vendors have invested in significantly more robust infrastructure to prevent a recurrence, reducing the probability of a technical postponement.\n\nHowever, my confidence is substantially tempered, which is why the forecast is not higher. The primary reason for this is the conflicting information and lack of official confirmation. The company's own transfer agent, Computershare, lists a different date (June 2, 2025). This is a highly credible source. The definitive document, the DEF 14A proxy statement, has not yet been filed with the SEC as of May 27, 2025. This absence of official confirmation so close to the prospective date is unusual and creates significant uncertainty about the true date.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the June 12 date is more widely reported and aligns perfectly with the company's established scheduling cadence, making it more probable than the alternative date. Barring official confirmation to the contrary, this historical pattern is a strong indicator. There is always a residual risk of a last-minute strategic postponement or an unforeseen technical issue, but the main driver of uncertainty is the conflicting date information.\n\nMy forecast would move towards 100% upon the official SEC filing of the DEF 14A confirming the June 12 date. Conversely, it would drop to 0% if the filing confirms any other date.",
