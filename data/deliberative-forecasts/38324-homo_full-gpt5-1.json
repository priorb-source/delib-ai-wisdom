    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning is aligned with my initial view: the debt ceiling is binding, the gap to $37T (~$0.8T) is large, and absent an earlier-than-usual deal, June 27 likely records a No. They add emphasis on two timing points I agree with: (1) even a deal on/near June 27 probably won’t move the end-of-day Debt to the Penny reading enough (historically the big jump shows the next business day), and (2) the modal pattern is action close to the X-date, which BPC places mostly after late June. Their estimates of post-lift catch-up (+~$360B next day, ~+$600B in a week) match my priors; they note that a mid-June deal plus rapid TGA rebuild could plausibly push totals over $37T by June 27. One area of uncertainty they flag well is how large the immediate EM unwind could be this cycle—conceivably larger than 2023—which modestly supports a higher tail for Yes if a mid-June deal lands.",
    "rationale": "My base logic remains: with the ceiling binding, TPDO stays capped near ~$36.2T; a Yes requires both an earlier-than-usual resolution (likely by mid-June) and a very swift unwind (trust-fund restoration plus sizable bill issuance) to add ~+$0.8T by June 27. Political precedent and the BPC X-date window reduce the odds of a mid-June deal. Even a deal on June 27 probably leaves the same-day reading below $37T. \n\nWhat I’m updating on from the deliberation is a slightly higher weight on the non-trivial path to Yes if Congress acts by mid-June: immediate restoration could approach or exceed ~$600B within a week, and today’s financing needs might enable faster TGA rebuild than in 2023. That nudges my probability up modestly but still leaves it well below 50% given the timing risks. \n\nKey drivers I’ll watch: concrete Hill reporting of a mid-June vote/suspension, Treasury bill auction schedules pointing to rapid cash rebuild, and daily Debt to the Penny levels. Absent those, No remains the default.",
