    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most critical new information: current data shows 22.7 million California residents already in drought areas as of May 27, 2025 - that's 2.7 million above the threshold with only 30 days until resolution. This fundamentally changes the question from 'will drought reach 20 million?' to 'will drought decrease by more than 2.7 million in 30 days during the dry season?' Forecaster 3 adds valuable supporting evidence with NOAA's forecast of drought persisting through August and extreme heat watches being issued. Both forecasters correctly identify that the short timeframe (30 days) and seasonal timing (entering summer dry season) strongly favor status quo persistence. Forecaster 2's mention of Lake Oroville at 86% and 96% snowpack is interesting but their analysis correctly notes this doesn't immediately translate to drought designation changes, which depend on recent precipitation patterns. The convergence of their forecasts at 87% and 78% (average ~83%) with this new baseline data is compelling.",
    "rationale": "I initially forecast 65% without knowing the current drought population baseline. The revelation that 22.7 million residents are already in drought areas (13.5% above threshold) dramatically increases the probability of a Yes outcome. For resolution to be No, the drought-affected population would need to decrease by more than 2.7 million people in just 30 days during California's dry season - historically June is one of the driest months. While my research assistant mentioned potential storm systems (Tropical Storm Alvin), these represent short-term weather events unlikely to reduce drought designations significantly within a month. NOAA's forecast of drought persisting through August provides authoritative confirmation of likely conditions. The Drought Monitor updates weekly (4-5 times before resolution), and drought conditions typically change slowly. My updated forecast reflects: (1) the substantial buffer above threshold, (2) the unfavorable seasonal timing, (3) authoritative predictions of persistence, and (4) the very short timeframe. I'm settling at 85% rather than Forecaster 2's 87% to maintain slightly more uncertainty around weather unpredictability and measurement precision, but this represents a significant upward revision from my initial 65%.",
