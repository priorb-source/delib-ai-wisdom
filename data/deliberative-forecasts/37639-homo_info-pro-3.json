    "review": "The other forecasters made a compelling and decisive argument by highlighting a critical piece of information I had missed: the existence of an extended Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) from a federal judge. Forecaster 3, in particular, noted the judge found Mahmoud Khalil's claims 'plausible,' which is a strong signal of judicial skepticism towards the government's case. My initial analysis focused on the political will of the executive branch to overcome bureaucratic inertia, but I treated a judicial stay as a possibility rather than a reality. Their analyses correctly identify that this active judicial barrier is the single most important factor in the forecast. It shifts the status quo from 'in process' to 'judicially blocked.' Their reasoning, centered on the immense difficulty of overcoming this legal hurdle within the short 47-day timeframe, is far more persuasive than my original thesis.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically updating my forecast from 65% to 5%. The new information about the active TRO, introduced by the other forecasters, fundamentally invalidates the core assumption of my initial analysis. I had predicted that overwhelming political pressure would be sufficient to expedite the deportation. However, that pressure is now running into the firm wall of judicial review, not just bureaucratic sludge. The judge's decision to extend the TRO and deem the claims 'plausible' makes a rapid resolution in the government's favor extremely unlikely. The path to a 'Yes' outcome before July 1 now requires the government to win an expedited legal battle to dissolve the TRO and defeat a preliminary injunction, a process that almost certainly will take longer than the 47 days available. The arguments from Forecasters 2 and 3 have convinced me that the legal process is the dominant variable, and it strongly favors a 'No' resolution within this timeframe. My new 5% forecast reflects that while deportation is not impossible (e.g., a sudden reversal by the judge, or Khalil abandoning his case), it is now a remote possibility rather than the likely outcome I previously envisioned.",
