    "review": "My initial forecast was 85%. I found Forecaster 2's analysis (90%) highly convincing, particularly the emphasis on the public acceptance of the invitation and host-nation preparations. This reframes the situation from Zelenskyy having a strong incentive to attend to it being the default, planned outcome, which requires a significant event to derail it. This argument strengthens the case for a 'Yes'. Conversely, I found Forecaster 3's analysis (65%) unconvincing because its central premise rests on a factual error. Forecaster 3 claimed Zelenskyy's attendance precedent was 'mixed' and cited virtual participation in the 2024 summit. However, President Zelenskyy attended the 2024 G7 summit in Italy in person, as he did the 2023 summit in Japan. This undermines the argument for a lower probability. The correct precedent shows a clear pattern of in-person attendance at the last two summits, including one involving long-haul travel similar to a trip to Canada.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 85% to 90%. My initial reasoning, which centered on the strategic importance and strong precedent for attendance, was reinforced by the deliberation. Forecaster 2's point about the diplomatic and logistical momentum created by a public invitation and acceptance was pivotal. This establishes in-person attendance as the firm status quo, not just a high-probability option. Annulling this plan would now require a major intervening event, such as a severe battlefield crisis or a specific, credible security threat against his travel. The argument from Forecaster 3 was discounted due to its reliance on incorrect information about Zelenskyy's 2024 attendance. The actual precedent of two consecutive years of in-person attendance strongly supports a high probability. Therefore, I am aligning with Forecaster 2's assessment, which better captures the high likelihood of the planned event proceeding, while reserving a 10% probability for a high-impact, war-related disruption.",
