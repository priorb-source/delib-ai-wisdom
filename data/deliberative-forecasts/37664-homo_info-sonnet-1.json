    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces intriguing but unverified information about Claude Neptune completing red-team testing on May 18 with late May/early June availability. However, this contradicts both my research assistant's report (which made no mention of Neptune or imminent testing) and Forecaster 3's findings that February-March 2025 sources indicated 'later in 2025' releases. Without corroboration, I'm skeptical of these Neptune claims. That said, Forecaster 2 raises an excellent and underemphasized point: the naming constraint. The question explicitly requires both 'Claude' and '4' in the name, which adds a significant layer of uncertainty even if a model does launch. A release could be branded as 'Claude 3.5', 'Neptune', or some other variation. Forecaster 3's analysis closely aligns with mine - no announcements, typical launch timelines don't fit the remaining window, and 'later in 2025' language suggests post-July targets. The convergence between my analysis and Forecaster 3's strengthens my confidence in the lower probability range, while Forecaster 2's naming concern adds an additional constraint I hadn't fully weighted.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. The naming requirement is a meaningful additional constraint - even in scenarios where Anthropic launches a new model before July 1, there's non-trivial probability it won't be called 'Claude 4' specifically. This could be 'Claude 3.5 Opus', 'Claude Neptune', or another variation. Anthropic's naming conventions aren't perfectly predictable. The core logic remains: 46 days is a short window with no current announcements, historical patterns suggest longer development cycles, and industry sources pointed to later 2025 releases. I remain skeptical of the unverified Neptune claims from Forecaster 2, as they conflict with other available information. The combination of tight timeline, lack of signals, and now the explicit naming constraint justifies moving from 18% to 15%.",
