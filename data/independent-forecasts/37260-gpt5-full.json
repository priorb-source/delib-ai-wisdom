  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.\n\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.\n\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no official ban announcement by an authorized German body (in practice, the Federal Constitutional Court) before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No formal application to ban the AfD is filed; or an application is filed but the Federal Constitutional Court does not issue a final ban decision by July 1 (any interim steps or surveillance classifications do not amount to a party ban).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A qualified applicant (federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat) files immediately and, following an extraordinary trigger and near-unanimous political support, the Federal Constitutional Court conducts an unprecedentedly fast proceeding and announces a final party ban before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Legal mechanism and timelines: Under Germany’s Basic Law (Art. 21), only the Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) can ban a political party, and only after a formal application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat. Such cases are complex, involve extensive evidence and hearings, and historically take many months to years. The last major case (NPD) took years and still ended without a ban (2017).\n- Current status: As of May 2, 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD has been filed. A January 2025 Bundestag debate on a motion led by 124 MPs lacked majority support, and reporting at the time indicated no immediate decision. Without a filing, a ban is impossible; with a filing now, a final decision by July 1 is still implausible.\n- Base rates and precedent: Only two parties have been banned post‑WWII (SRP 1952, KPD 1956). The extremely low base rate and the Court’s procedural thoroughness push the probability toward “No,” especially on a ~60‑day horizon.\n- Politics and incentives: Polling shows AfD at roughly 25–26%, making it one of Germany’s strongest parties. Banning a major party would be politically explosive. Even if political appetite suddenly grew, building and passing a formal application and then securing a rapid Court ruling by July 1 remains highly unlikely.\n- Clarifications: The BfV’s designation of the AfD as a “proven right‑wing extremist organization” permits surveillance but is not a party ban. Interim or administrative steps short of a BVerfG ban would not meet the resolution criterion.\n- Why not higher: Procedural realities (no application, lengthy court process), low base rate, and absence of majority support in January make a ban by July 1 extraordinarily unlikely.\n- Why not lower (nonzero tail): A black‑swan shock (e.g., catastrophic revelations or violence clearly tied to the party’s leadership), rapid political consensus, and an unprecedentedly expedited BVerfG process could, in theory, produce a ban—though this would break with historical practice.\n- What would move me upward: (1) A formal application filed immediately by the federal government/Bundestag/Bundesrat; (2) BVerfG publicly announcing an expedited calendar for a party‑ban case; (3) broad, cross‑party political consensus for a ban following a major national security event; (4) explicit signals from the Court about preliminary measures tantamount to a ban. Even with (1) and (2), the probability before July 1 would remain low but would rise marginally.\n- What would move me downward: Continued absence of a filing through May/June; signals from government leaders rejecting a ban filing this term; no Court activity indicating expedition.",
