    "review": "I notice a critical discrepancy in how we're interpreting the current situation. Both Forecasters 2 and 3 describe the status quo as Harvard's certification being revoked, treating legal relief as a future possibility. However, the research assistant explicitly states that 'a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO)' on May 23, and 'As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active.' This fundamentally changes the analysis.\n\nForecaster 2 writes 'Harvard is highly likely to seek an emergency TRO' - but this has already happened. Forecaster 3 says Harvard 'will certainly seek a preliminary injunction' - treating this as future action when we're already past the TRO stage. Both are valuable in highlighting political pressures and court deference concerns, but they appear to be forecasting from a baseline where the certification is currently revoked, when it's actually currently active under court protection.\n\nForecaster 2's 2020 precedent point is valuable - it shows DHS can back down under legal pressure. Forecaster 3's emphasis on executive deference in immigration matters is important, as are concerns about political motivations. However, the fact that the TRO was already granted indicates a judge has already preliminarily found Harvard likely to succeed on the merits and face irreparable harm. The May 29 hearing is about extending this protection via preliminary injunction, not obtaining initial relief.\n\nThe key insight both offer is that nothing is guaranteed - appeals, stays, or an unfavorable May 29 ruling could change the status quo. But they may be underweighting how significant it is that protective relief is already in place.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm maintaining my assessment that the current status quo favors a Yes outcome. The TRO being already granted is crucial - it means a federal judge has preliminarily determined that Harvard likely has strong legal claims. The default trajectory is that this protection continues through preliminary injunction at the May 29 hearing.\n\nThe other forecasters raise valid concerns about executive deference and political stakes, which prevent certainty. However, their lower forecasts (62% and 35%) appear to assume we're starting from a position where the certification is revoked and Harvard must obtain relief, rather than recognizing relief is already in place and would need to be removed for a No outcome.\n\nRisks that could lead to No: (1) May 29 hearing results in TRO dissolution and PI denial - unlikely given TRO was granted, (2) Expedited appeal with stay granted - possible but requires quick appellate action within 34 days, (3) Some administrative or procedural complication.\n\nThe strongest argument from the other forecasters is about court deference to executive branch on immigration/national security. This is genuine concern. However, the TRO grant suggests this judge is taking Harvard's constitutional claims seriously despite those considerations.\n\nI'm maintaining my forecast at 82%. The current active status under TRO, the preliminary judicial finding in Harvard's favor, and the relatively short 34-day timeline all support this probability.",
