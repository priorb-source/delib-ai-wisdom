    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts clustered between 30% and 35%. Our reasoning is also highly aligned, focusing on the tension between the recent precedent of two calls in early 2025 and the explicit recent Kremlin statements downplaying imminent contact and emphasizing the need for preparation. Forecaster 2 introduced a helpful 'base rate' analysis, noting the cadence of past calls (one every 5-6 weeks) makes another call within the ~5-week resolution window plausible. This was a point I hadn't quantified and provides a solid argument for a non-trivial probability. Forecaster 3 made an excellent and novel point that I had not considered: the recent talk about preparing for a more significant *in-person meeting* could actually *delay* a simple phone call. Diplomatic efforts might now be focused on lower-level preparations for a summit, making an interim call between the principals less likely. This is a compelling argument that pushes against the base rate logic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 30%. The new arguments presented largely pull in opposite directions. Forecaster 2's point about the 'base rate' of calls provides a slight upward pressure on my forecast, reinforcing the idea that another call is not out of the question based on recent history. However, I find Forecaster 3's argument that preparations for a potential future summit could delay a near-term phone call to be more compelling in the current context. The Kremlin's public statements have shifted from discussing calls to discussing the need for expert-level preparation for a 'necessary' meeting. This suggests the diplomatic focus has moved to a more structured process, making an ad-hoc call in the next 32 days less likely than the previous cadence would suggest. These two new counter-balancing arguments effectively cancel each other out, leaving me confident in my initial assessment. The consensus among the three of us in the low 30s reinforces that this is the correct probability space. I am not increasing my forecast because the Kremlin's messaging is a strong, direct signal against an imminent call. I am not decreasing it because the channel is clearly open, and geopolitical volatility or Trump's diplomatic style could easily override the current stated plans.",
