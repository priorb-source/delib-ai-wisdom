  "information": "In response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beyond Meat continues to operate and implement its turnaround strategy without filing for bankruptcy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat's cost-cutting measures and existing cash reserves prove sufficient to maintain operations and meet all financial obligations for the next seven weeks, pushing any potential bankruptcy event beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe liquidity crisis, potentially triggered by the loss of a major customer, a supplier credit crunch, or an unforeseen liability, forces management to seek bankruptcy protection as the only viable option to restructure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the very short time remaining until the resolution date. While Beyond Meat is in significant financial distress, with substantial ongoing losses, a bankruptcy filing in the next seven weeks is a low-probability event. The key factor is liquidity. As of their last full-year report, the company had a significant cash reserve, which, despite a high burn rate, should be sufficient to cover operations through this short period. The information from my research assistant reinforces this view; management is actively taking steps to reduce cash burn, such as workforce reductions and suspending operations in China. These actions, while indicative of deep problems, are designed to extend the company's financial runway and avoid a near-term bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a drastic step, and companies typically exhaust all other options before filing. The current status quo is a difficult but managed operational environment, and it is more likely this continues for another two months than it is for the company to abruptly file for protection without a clear, immediate catalyst. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the company's situation is genuinely precarious. A rapid deterioration in sales, the loss of a key distribution partner, or a covenant breach on a smaller credit facility could accelerate a liquidity crisis unexpectedly. Market sentiment is extremely negative, which can also become a self-fulfilling issue with suppliers and creditors.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there are no known, imminent catalysts for a bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025. Their major convertible debt is not due until 2027, and their recent actions suggest a focus on muddling through the current period. I would increase my forecast probability if there were news of a failed capital raise, a major credit line being pulled, or a significant downward revision of their sales outlook. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if they announced a new financing deal or a major strategic partnership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
