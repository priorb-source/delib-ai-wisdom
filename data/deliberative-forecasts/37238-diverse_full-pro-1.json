    "review": "The other two forecasters provided compelling arguments that have prompted a significant revision of my initial forecast. Their shared emphasis on establishing a low base rate for attendance at any single UFC event was a critical insight I had overlooked. I initially weighed the pro/con arguments against a 50/50 baseline, whereas Forecasters 2 and 3 correctly argued that the default assumption should be non-attendance. This framing is more rigorous. Furthermore, both forecasters placed a heavier, and I now believe more appropriate, weight on the historical precedent that Trump 'rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.' I found Forecaster 3's structured approach of evaluating 'upward and downward pressures' against this baseline particularly convincing. My initial analysis overweighted the geographical convenience and underweighted the strong negative signal from his recent appearance at UFC 314.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 65% to 45%. The core reason for this change is the adoption of a more disciplined forecasting approach, as highlighted by the other forecasters. Instead of treating this as an even proposition, I now start with a low base rate of attendance for any specific UFC event. While Trump's friendship with Dana White and his general affinity for the UFC are notable, they don't guarantee his presence at every major card. The primary negative factor remains his attendance at UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. The short, less-than-two-month turnaround to UFC 316 makes a repeat appearance inconsistent with his established patterns. This historical data point is a powerful argument for 'No.' However, I am keeping my forecast higher than the other forecasters because I continue to believe the geographical convenience of Newark, NJ, is an exceptionally strong positive factor. The logistical friction for him to attend is near zero, which makes this specific event an outlier and uniquely tempting. This, combined with a high-profile main event, creates a plausible scenario where he might break his usual pattern. My updated 45% forecast reflects that non-attendance is now the most likely outcome, but the confluence of positive factors makes this a very close call.",
