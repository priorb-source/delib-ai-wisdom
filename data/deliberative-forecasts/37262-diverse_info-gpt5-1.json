    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the short window, the Global Protest Tracker’s selectivity/lag, and state suppression all align with my priors. Their reference to GPT’s limited annual additions is a useful quantitative framing for why an India entry in a two‑month window is nontrivial. Forecaster 3 brings new, specific claims (a planned 10,000‑farmer march and TMC rallies). If verified and framed as protests (not routine party rallies), those would materially raise odds. However, absent corroboration and given GPT’s tendency to catalog large, salient episodes rather than isolated regional actions, I find 70% too high. The tracker’s curation and timing remain the bottlenecks, not India’s ability to generate 10k‑plus crowds.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: (1) India’s high base rate for large demonstrations; (2) multiple live flashpoints (Waqf/land law, communal tensions, labor/farmers’ issues) that can scale quickly; countered by (3) a short time window; (4) GPT’s selective coverage and update lag; and (5) security responses that can fragment or pre‑empt large gatherings. The new argument from Forecaster 3 about specific planned mobilizations would justify an uptick if confirmed, but without clear dates or indications of national scope—and given GPT’s preference for major, clearly defined episodes—I don’t think it warrants a large move. I adjust slightly upward to reflect the plausible near‑term catalysts and the relatively low 10k threshold in Indian metros, while still discounting for GPT inclusion risk and timing. I would move higher on verified announcements of large, coordinated protests within May–June (e.g., a national bandh or a dated farmers’ march) or evidence GPT is posting 2025 entries promptly. I would move lower if late May passes without large mobilizations or if unrest stays localized without clear national framing.",
