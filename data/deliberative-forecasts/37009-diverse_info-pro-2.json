    "review": "I found the deliberation with the other forecasters highly valuable, as it introduced new information and highlighted risks I may have understated. \n\nForecaster 2's analysis, at 14%, seems to be based on incomplete information. Their claims of \"no public evidence\" of preparation and a lack of \"trial balloons\" are directly contradicted by both my initial research assistant's report (staff expansion, seeking a replacement) and the specific media reports cited by Forecaster 3. For this reason, I find their reasoning unconvincing and their forecast far too low.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis, at 70%, was much more compelling. They introduced crucial new evidence: specific, recent reports from Politico and other outlets signaling an announcement as \"early as next week.\" This corroborates my initial assessment of her intent. However, Forecaster 3 also rightly emphasizes the risk of delays within the short, 9-day window. Political announcements are frequently postponed for logistical or strategic reasons, and a slip of just a few days would change the outcome of this question. This is a key point of uncertainty that my initial forecast may have discounted too heavily.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly decreasing my forecast from 90% to 85%. My initial confidence was based on strong signals of preparation: significant fundraising, staff expansion, and, most importantly, actively seeking a replacement for her House seat. These actions indicate a decision to run has almost certainly been made.\n\nThe new information from Forecaster 3, particularly the Politico report of a potential announcement \"as early as next week,\" strongly reinforces the imminence of the launch and confirms that the preparatory signals were accurate. This new evidence pushes back against the arguments made by Forecaster 2 and solidifies the case for a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nHowever, I am making a minor downward adjustment to better account for the 'last mile' risk highlighted by Forecaster 3. The deadline of May 1 is unforgiving. Even with clear intent and a planned announcement, minor logistical hitches, a desire to respond to a changing news cycle, or finalizing a launch video could easily push the official announcement from the last week of April into the first week of May. My initial 90% forecast implied only a 10% chance of such a slip, which I now believe is slightly too low. My revised 85% forecast still reflects a very high likelihood of an announcement before the deadline, but better incorporates the non-trivial possibility of a short-term delay.",
