    "review": "Both forecasters credibly stress coordinated RHDP signaling and the likelihood the internal decision is already made. The strongest new argument is their emphasis on “momentum” from repeated ministerial pre-announcements as evidence of near-term timing. However, neither provides concrete indicators of a May-dated party congress, rally, or formal event that would anchor a pre–June 1 declaration. I find their reasoning directionally persuasive about eventual candidacy, but less so on the tight May timing. The absence of known procedural deadlines or scheduled May milestones remains a key counterweight. Their thresholds (62–65%) seem high without a confirmed May vehicle for the announcement.",
    "rationale": "I still expect Ouattara to run, but the specific question is about declaring before June 1. Incentives to delay remain strong: no imminent legal deadline, strategic value in maintaining ambiguity, and a weakened opposition reducing the need to lock in early. Against that, the drumbeat from senior ministers and pro-Ouattara groups suggests the decision is effectively taken and raises the odds of a May announcement if RHDP wants to consolidate and mobilize. Since peers highlight the breadth and consistency of party signaling (which I slightly underweighted), I modestly increase my probability. I am holding below 50% due to (1) lack of a publicly known May congress or major event, (2) his 2020 pattern of a late announcement for an October election, and (3) persistent benefits of delay. I would move up quickly if RHDP schedules a May congress/rally or credible reports surface of an imminent address naming his candidacy. I would move down if continued messaging stresses ongoing consultations or points to a summer timetable. Change: up from 38% to 45%.",
