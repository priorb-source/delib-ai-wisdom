  "information": "President Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the government of Uruguay has not announced that President Orsi will attend the BRICS summit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay prioritizes President Orsi's confirmed attendance at the UN conference in Seville, Spain, which runs from June 30 to July 3. Due to this logistical and scheduling conflict, no announcement is made about him attending the BRICS summit in Brazil, and the deadline of July 1 passes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the scheduling conflict, Uruguay's government decides the diplomatic value of accepting President Lula's invitation is paramount. It issues a statement before the July 1 deadline confirming President Orsi's intention to attend, potentially planning for him to arrive late or depart the Spain conference early, satisfying the resolution criteria regardless of his actual travel.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is strongly influenced by the high-confidence information that President Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to attend a UN conference in Seville, Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025. This creates a significant logistical barrier to him also attending a summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in July. The resolution deadline is July 1, by which time the President is scheduled to be in Spain. The status quo is 'No,' as no announcement has been made, and with less than a month remaining, this is the most likely outcome to persist. The probability is not lower than 10% because the resolution only requires an announcement, not actual attendance. The Uruguayan government could make a purely political announcement to signal goodwill towards Brazil and the BRICS bloc, even if they know the President's attendance is logistically unfeasible. The probability is not higher because a direct and public scheduling conflict is very strong evidence against the likelihood of an announcement. Governments rarely announce their head of state will be in two different continents at the same time. I would increase my forecast if there were news of the Spain conference being rescheduled or if officials began signaling that attendance was being actively arranged. I would decrease my forecast if Uruguay announced a different, lower-level representative for the BRICS summit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
