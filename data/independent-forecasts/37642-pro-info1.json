  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Federal Reserve will maintain the current federal funds rate range, continuing its data-dependent 'wait-and-see' approach.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data for April and May 2025 continues to be persistent, remaining well above the 2% target. The labor market remains strong, and Fed officials, in their public appearances leading up to the June FOMC meeting, reiterate their cautious stance and signal that they require more confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path downwards before considering a rate cut.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and unexpected negative economic shock occurs, such as a sharp rise in the unemployment rate or a sudden financial market instability event. This forces the FOMC to act preemptively to support the economy, leading them to announce a rate cut at their June 2025 meeting.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the Federal Reserve's explicitly communicated policy of patience and data-dependency, weighed against the very short time remaining until the resolution date. The status quo is for the Fed to hold rates steady, as they have done for several meetings. The information from my research assistant strongly supports this baseline. Fed Chair Powell is 'not in a hurry to cut,' and the FOMC minutes indicate a need for more consistent inflation improvement. Furthermore, the Fed's own inflation forecast was revised upwards to 2.7% in March 2025, which reduces the immediate impetus for easing policy. While the Fed did project two cuts for 2025, the timing is not specified, and recent rhetoric suggests they are more likely to occur in the second half of the year, after more data has been accumulated. With only one scheduled FOMC meeting occurring before July 1st (in June), the bar for a cut is very high. They would need to see a significant and rapid deterioration in economic data to alter their cautious stance so quickly. My probability is not lower than 25% because a rate cut is still on the table for 2025, and an unforeseen negative economic shock could accelerate that timeline. A sharp, unexpected drop in inflation or a spike in unemployment are tail risks that could trigger a cut. My probability is not higher because the available evidence, particularly the Fed's own recent statements and inflation projections, points overwhelmingly towards continued patience. The most likely scenario is that they hold rates in June and wait for more data. I would increase my forecast if upcoming CPI and jobs reports show a significant and surprising weakening of the economy. I would decrease it if inflation remains stubborn or accelerates, or if Fed officials explicitly message that a summer cut is off the table.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
