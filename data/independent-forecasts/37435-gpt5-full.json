  "information": "Chegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance, with potential measures including a reverse stock split. Chegg is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 financial results on May 12, 2025. Analyst predictions for the quarter include earnings of $0.01 per share and revenue of $114.77 million.\n\nCompetition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model. In response, Chegg is introducing its own AI-powered features, such as 'Create' and 'Solution Scout'. In February 2025, the company filed a lawsuit against Google for unfair competition. Management is also undertaking a comprehensive strategic review, which includes considering privatization or acquisition as potential options. Furthermore, Chegg has initiated cost-cutting measures with the goal of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin and generating over $100 million in free cash flow by 2025.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for the company. Chegg's financial metrics include a negative Altman Z-score of -3.31, an indicator of potential financial distress. Conversely, its Piotroski F-Score is 7, suggesting some aspects of its financial health remain robust. As of its last report, the company maintained a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars, reported positive free cash flow, and had no large debt maturities due before 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg reports weak but manageable Q1 results, reiterates cost cuts and cash preservation, perhaps announces/advances strategic alternatives (sale/privatization) and prepares a reverse split to address NYSE compliance. Cash balance remains solid and no near-term debt maturities force action. The company continues operating through June without a bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A surprise liquidity or solvency shock emerges in May/June: e.g., a major covenant breach leading to debt acceleration, an adverse legal/judicial event, a severe cash burn disclosure with going-concern warnings, or creditors/vendors tightening terms causing a rapid cash crunch. Management opts for a prepackaged Chapter 11 to restructure obligations or execute a quick sale before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the status quo favors no filing. The research assistant notes: (1) Chegg has net cash in the hundreds of millions, positive free cash flow, and no major debt maturities until 2026; (2) while revenue has declined for nine straight quarters and the Altman Z-score is negative (distress signal), the Piotroski F-Score is 7 and liquidity appears adequate; (3) the NYSE non-compliance is a share-price issue typically addressed via a reverse split and does not itself necessitate bankruptcy; (4) management is pursuing cost cuts and strategic alternatives, and analysts still expect a small positive EPS for Q1 2025. Given these, the base-case is continued operation without a filing in the next ~2 months. Why not higher: Filing imminently would be unusual for a net-cash, FCF-positive firm with no near-term maturities; bankruptcy would likely destroy brand value when other options (reverse split, M&A, continued cost reduction) exist. Why not lower: Tail risks remain—Q1 results (May 12) could reveal a sharper-than-expected cash burn, going-concern language, undisclosed covenant issues, or other adverse developments; unexpected creditor actions or a strategic decision to use Chapter 11 as a sale mechanism could emerge. Upward updates: Signs of acute liquidity stress (cash balance plunge, negative operating cash flow guidance), auditor going-concern warning, default/covenant breach notices, hiring of restructuring counsel/advisors, forbearance/exchange offers, or adverse legal judgments. Downward updates: Q1 shows stable/adequate cash and FCF, credible cost-down plan toward the stated 30% EBITDA margin, confirmation of no covenant pressure, announced strategic transaction or committed financing, or clear guidance that reduces near-term risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
