    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini wins at least one award among her three nominations, securing a victory in one or more of her nominated categories",
    "rationale": "With 3 nominations, Ballerini has multiple opportunities to win. Using base rate analysis, if we assume roughly 5 nominees per category (typical for major awards), the mathematical probability of winning at least one award would be approximately 49% [1-(0.8)³]. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) We lack specific information about which categories she's nominated in, (2) We don't know who her competitors are or their relative strength, (3) No information on betting markets or industry predictions is available, (4) Awards voting is already complete or nearly complete, making this largely predetermined. Ballerini is an established, credible country artist who has won ACM awards previously, suggesting she's likely competitive in her categories rather than a long-shot nominee. This pushes probability slightly above the pure mathematical base rate. The forecast isn't higher because we lack evidence she's the favorite in any specific category, and three nominations don't guarantee success against strong competition. The forecast isn't lower because three legitimate nominations from a respected artist provides substantial winning opportunity. To update higher, I'd need evidence she's favored in one or more categories (betting odds, industry predictions, momentum). To update lower, I'd need information showing she faces dominant competition in all categories.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
