    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses align closely with mine and raise excellent points. All three of us converged on 25-30%, identifying the same core constraints: the dual requirement of actual policy action AND maintainer judgment, the CPB funding mechanism, congressional processes being slow, and the short 46-day timeline. Forecaster 3's point about legal challenges is well-taken and something I should have explicitly mentioned. All forecasters appropriately emphasized the distinction between 'proposed' versus 'actually implemented and confirmed' - the maintainers likely require actual cessation of funding, not just executive orders or proposals. The convergence around 28-30% from Forecasters 2 and 3 suggests my 25% may have been slightly too conservative, though the reasoning is fundamentally sound.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly upward. The consensus around 25-30% appears well-calibrated given the constraints. While my core reasoning remains valid - the severe timeline constraint, the high bar for 'complete' status, and the complexity of federal appropriations - I'm persuaded that 25% was marginally too low. The 'in progress' designation does suggest more active momentum than I initially weighted. However, I'm not moving all the way to 28-30% because the timeline remains exceptionally tight for complete defunding. Even with executive action, full implementation and maintainer recognition of 'complete' status (rather than just 'progress') within 46 days faces substantial procedural and bureaucratic hurdles. Legal challenges would further delay any determination of completion. The maintainers' conservative approach to status updates (keeping it at 'in progress' despite some action) suggests they require concrete, verified completion. My updated forecast of 27% reflects modest upward adjustment based on collective reasoning while maintaining appropriate skepticism about achieving 'complete' status by July 1.",
