  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current status is a diplomatic freeze at the leader level, with no acknowledged calls since January 2025 and recent public statements from both sides indicating no immediate plans for a call.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11 conclude without a significant breakthrough. The diplomatic standoff continues, the 'birthday summit' idea is not revived, and no other geopolitical crisis emerges that would compel the two leaders to speak. The June 15 deadline passes without a mutually acknowledged phone call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The trade talks in Geneva produce an unexpected and substantial framework for de-escalating the trade war. To capitalize on the momentum and personally ratify the progress, President Trump and President Xi arrange a direct phone call. Both Washington and Beijing subsequently confirm the call occurred.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence supporting the status quo. The last acknowledged call was nearly four months ago, and as recently as May 5, both sides publicly affirmed there are no immediate plans to speak. The requirement for mutual acknowledgement is a high bar in the current climate of distrust, where the US president has previously claimed calls took place which China has denied. The status quo points strongly towards 'No'.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because there is a significant potential catalyst for change on the immediate horizon: the high-level trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11. A major breakthrough at this meeting could plausibly necessitate a leaders' call to finalize an agreement within the question's timeframe. The previously floated idea of a 'birthday summit' in June, while its current status is uncertain, suggests that high-level contact is not entirely off the table.\n\nThe probability is not higher because the success of the Geneva talks is far from guaranteed. Furthermore, President Xi's concurrent visit with President Putin in Moscow may signal a hardened stance against the US, making a conciliatory call less likely. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' the current diplomatic inertia must be overcome by a significant positive event, which remains a possibility but is not the most likely scenario.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible, positive readouts emerge from the Geneva talks from both sides. I would decrease it if those talks collapse or if either side issues stronger denials of any planned high-level contact.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
