  "information": "Russia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia's military remains fully committed to its war in Ukraine and does not launch a new ground invasion of another country. The strategic focus and resource allocation remain on the Ukrainian front, and the geopolitical situation in neighboring countries remains stable enough to avert a new Russian military intervention before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant escalation occurs in a region like Moldova's Transnistria or Georgia's breakaway territories, prompting Russia to send additional ground forces into that country's sovereign territory without government consent. The United States intelligence community detects this action, and the White House or State Department publicly condemns it as an invasion.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on two factors: the short timeframe of two months and Russia's current military posture. The Russian military is heavily invested and attritted in its ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Launching a new ground invasion of another country would require a significant diversion of personnel and materiel that Russia appears to lack. The research assistant's report corroborates this, noting the absence of any significant new Russian troop buildups on other borders. Given that modern invasions require extensive and observable logistical preparation, the lack of such signals is a strong indicator that no new invasion is imminent. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 3% because I must account for low-probability, high-impact events. The most plausible scenarios would involve a rapid escalation in Moldova or Georgia, where Russia already has a military presence and established political interests. A sudden political crisis or perceived provocation in one of these areas could lead to an opportunistic and limited Russian intervention, even if strategically costly. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 3% because the operational and strategic barriers to opening a new front are currently immense for Russia. Their forces are stretched thin, and a new conflict would risk dangerously destabilizing their primary effort in Ukraine. Any preparations would likely be detected by Western intelligence, as they were prior to the 2022 Ukraine invasion, inviting international condemnation and support for the targeted nation, which acts as a deterrent. \n\nI would increase my forecast if credible intelligence emerged of Russian ground forces massing on the border of another country. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches without any such indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
