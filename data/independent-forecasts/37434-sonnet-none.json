    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - AquaBounty continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty manages its cash flow through the end of June, potentially secures bridge financing or debt restructuring, reduces operational costs, or delays creditor payments while remaining outside of bankruptcy protection. The company continues filing required SEC reports and operating its facilities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty exhausts its cash reserves, fails to secure emergency financing, cannot meet critical debt obligations or vendor payments, and management determines that Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is necessary to restructure debts or facilitate an orderly wind-down. The company files a petition before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. AquaBounty filed its Full Year 2024 Financial Results on March 27, 2025 - just 5-6 weeks ago - indicating the company was still operating and meeting its regulatory reporting obligations at that time. Companies typically don't collapse from functioning operations to bankruptcy filing within 2-3 months without significant warning signs or triggering events. My research assistant provided no additional information about the content of those financial results, so I cannot assess current cash position, burn rate, or debt covenant violations. However, the mere fact that financial results were filed suggests some level of ongoing operations. The base rate for any company filing bankruptcy in a specific 2-month window is very low, even for financially distressed companies. AquaBounty has historically faced financial challenges as a biotech company commercializing genetically modified salmon, which suggests some elevated risk. My forecast is not lower because: (1) I lack detailed financial information that might show strong liquidity, (2) the company's history of financial struggles, and (3) the specific nature of this question suggests some level of concern. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the short time horizon limits deterioration potential, (2) recent SEC filing indicates continued operations, (3) strong status quo bias, and (4) bankruptcy is still a relatively rare corporate action. I would revise upward if I learned: the company had minimal cash reserves, was facing imminent debt defaults, had lost access to credit facilities, or announced plans for wind-down operations. I would revise downward if I learned: the company had secured new financing, showed positive cash flow, or announced strategic partnerships.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
