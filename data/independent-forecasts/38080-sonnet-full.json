  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "34 days from May 28, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Harvard currently HAS SEVP certification due to the temporary restraining order (TRO) granted on May 23, 2025. If this status quo persists, the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal judge denies Harvard's request for a preliminary injunction at the May 29 hearing, allowing the TRO to expire. The DHS revocation takes effect, and Harvard loses its SEVP certification before July 1. Appeals or emergency motions fail to restore certification in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal judge grants a preliminary injunction at the May 29 hearing, maintaining Harvard's SEVP certification through July 1 and beyond. Alternatively, the TRO remains in effect through July 1, or the parties reach a settlement restoring certification, or Harvard wins on the merits before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor is that Harvard already secured a TRO on May 23, which currently keeps its SEVP certification active. This is a strong signal that the judge found: (1) likelihood of success on Harvard's constitutional claims, (2) irreparable harm to Harvard and its students, (3) balance of equities favoring Harvard, and (4) public interest in maintaining the status quo. These same standards apply to preliminary injunctions, making it likely the court will grant one at the May 29 hearing. Preliminary injunctions typically remain in effect for months or years while cases proceed, so if granted, it would almost certainly extend past July 1 (only 33 days after the hearing). The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome - Harvard currently HAS certification, and maintaining this for just 34 more days is much more likely than a dramatic reversal. Courts historically protect academic freedom and move slowly, especially in politically charged cases. Harvard's legal arguments appear robust, citing First Amendment retaliation, Due Process violations, and Administrative Procedure Act breaches. The administration's actions were unprecedented and appear politically motivated rather than following standard regulatory procedures. However, uncertainty remains: the May 29 hearing outcome is not guaranteed, the Trump administration has shown willingness to push legal boundaries aggressively, and political pressure on the judiciary exists. The judge could theoretically deny the preliminary injunction, though this would contradict the TRO grant. Appeals or emergency motions could create complications, though unlikely within the 34-day window. For my forecast to move higher (85-95%), I would need to see the preliminary injunction granted at the May 29 hearing with strong language from the judge. For it to move lower (50-65%), the judge would need to signal skepticism about Harvard's case or deny the preliminary injunction request. The forecast balances strong legal positioning and favorable status quo against political unpredictability and the binary nature of the May 29 hearing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
