    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses at 28-30%, higher than my initial 18%. Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: Cornwall's independent-heavy landscape means the most likely alternative to Conservative dominance may not be Liberal Democrat victory but rather Independents winning the most seats. This is crucial since the question asks specifically if Lib Dems win the most seats, not merely whether Conservatives lose their plurality. Forecaster 3 also effectively quantifies the challenge: moving from 13 seats to the largest party requires 15-20+ net gains in a single cycle. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the 'perfect storm' conditions - catastrophic Conservative national polling, Reform vote-splitting, and strong LD organization. However, Forecaster 3's point about vote fragmentation hurting Lib Dems deserves more weight: Labour improvement in urban areas (Truro, Camborne) plus Independent strength in rural divisions could split the anti-Tory vote in ways that don't benefit Lib Dems. The chaotic three- and four-way splits could produce unpredictable outcomes where no party achieves a clear plurality.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative at 18%. The combination of unprecedented Conservative weakness (22% nationally), organized LD campaign with near-full slate and significant funding, recent parliamentary momentum, and Reform's vote-splitting creates a stronger case for an upset than I initially credited. However, I'm not convinced by the 28-30% range either. The critical insight is that this isn't a binary Conservative vs. Liberal Democrat question - Independents could emerge as the largest bloc if both major parties decline. The 31-seat starting deficit remains enormous, requiring the Lib Dems to gain roughly 15-20 seats net while also outpacing any Independent surge. In fragmented local elections with four-way splits (Conservative/LD/Reform/Independent, or Conservative/LD/Labour/Independent), the path to LD plurality becomes even more complex. The base rate of Lib Dems never having led Cornwall Council, combined with Cornwall's distinctive political culture favoring Independents, suggests stronger status quo bias than the others implied. Balancing the genuine 'perfect storm' factors against the arithmetic challenge, Independent competition, and vote fragmentation, I'm updating to 24% - acknowledging meaningful upside from my initial forecast while remaining more cautious than my peers about the structural barriers to a Lib Dem plurality.",
