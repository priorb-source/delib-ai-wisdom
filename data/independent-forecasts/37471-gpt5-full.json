  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (May 2025 data should post on FRED in late June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the inventory remains below 550k.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventories continue their gradual rise or stay roughly flat, ending May around 510–535k as softer starts and permits offset any sales softness.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rare, sharp two‑month jump (>47k combined) occurs: a surge in completions hits the market while sales suddenly weaken (e.g., mortgage rates spike and demand drops), pushing May’s stock above 550k.",
    "rationale": "Starting point is 503k in March 2025 (FRED HNFSEPUSSA), up slightly from 500k in February. To exceed 550k by May would require a 47k+ increase over two months, roughly a 9% jump. Historically, this series rarely moves that fast; levels above 550k were last seen only in the 2006–2007 peak. The assistant’s report notes: new home sales at 724k SAAR (+6% YoY), median prices lower, mortgage rates around 6.65–6.83%, starts down 14% MoM in March, single‑family permits down 2%, and NAHB HMI ~42. These mixed signals argue against a sharp near‑term supply spike: weaker starts/permits limit incoming supply, while somewhat firm sales reduce the odds of inventory ballooning quickly, even with higher rates. Baseline drift from 500k→503k suggests typical monthly gains of only a few thousand; reaching >550k by May would require an unusually large, sustained acceleration over April and May. That’s possible but unlikely. Why not higher: breaching 550k needs outsized monthly increases (e.g., +20–30k per month) that are rare outside extraordinary periods. Why not lower (closer to 0%): inventories have been trending up and could rise if sales stumble and completions rise; revisions are also a tail risk. Up/Down triggers: I would raise the probability if April’s FRED print comes in ≥530k, if mortgage rates lurch meaningfully higher with a clear sales slump, or if builder reports show a surge in spec inventory/completions. I would lower it if April prints ≤515k, if rates ease/stabilize with steady sales, or if starts/completions data signal tighter supply.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
