    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that challenge my initial 20% forecast. Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I underweighted: the July 9 EU tariff deadline falls just AFTER the resolution window, meaning June will feature intensive coverage of those negotiations, not a lull. This directly contradicts any assumption that the postponement would reduce coverage. Forecaster 2 also effectively distinguishes between public 'tariff burnout' and actual editorial judgment—outlets won't reduce coverage of consequential policy just because readers are tired of it. Forecaster 3's mathematical framework is useful, estimating daily probabilities and compounding them over 35 days. While the specific percentages (0.2-0.5% daily probability both papers skip) may be imprecise, the approach highlights how demanding the dual-paper requirement is. Both forecasters converge on 12-15%, significantly below my 20%. The key insight I missed: June isn't a dead zone between deadlines—it's the critical negotiating period before the July 9 deadline. Combined with ongoing 90-day pause expirations and sustained economic impacts, the status quo for continued coverage is stronger than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too optimistic about news cycle volatility creating opportunities for simultaneous omission. While 35 days provides multiple chances, the current situation has several factors maintaining high salience: (1) The July 9 EU deadline makes June a peak negotiation period, not a lull; (2) Multiple 90-day pauses expiring require active policy decisions; (3) Significant economic impacts ($830/household, job losses) warrant sustained coverage; (4) Both NYT and WSJ prioritize economic news and are unlikely to simultaneously deprioritize such a major ongoing story. The dual-paper requirement is more restrictive than I initially weighted—even if one paper occasionally skips tariffs, getting both to skip on the same day requires either a major competing story or an unusual confluence of editorial decisions. The mathematical approach suggests perhaps 0.3% daily probability both skip, yielding roughly 10% over 35 days before accounting for weekend/holiday variations or major breaking news, which might push it to 13-15%. I'm updating downward but not to the bottom of the range because unpredictable events could still create opportunities.",
