    "review": "Both analyses reinforce the status-quo baseline that the SOE expires on April 29 unless actively extended. Forecaster 2 adds a useful, concrete off-ramp: temporary generators expected online by end-April, which aligns with letting the SOE lapse—this is a new and persuasive detail I hadn’t explicitly weighed. They also correctly note commissioning slippage risk that could motivate a brief extension covering April 30. Forecaster 3 contributes an NEOC April 15 note reaffirming orders only through April 29 and observes no extension signals as of April 21; that strengthens the default-to-No framing. I find both arguments credible and consistent with typical government behavior around SOEs: preference to end when a plausible interim fix exists, but a non-trivial chance of a short renewal if reliability remains uncertain.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 40%, emphasizing the crisis’ severity and Samoa’s precedent of extending SOEs when conditions persist. The added points shift me modestly downward: (1) a concrete, time-aligned off-ramp via temporary generation by end-April, and (2) as of April 21, no public hints of extension. Both reduce the need and likelihood of maintaining emergency powers into April 30. Still, commissioning delays, fuel/logistics uncertainty, and grid tightness could motivate a brief extension. Given the hard end date of April 29 and no extension signals yet, but acknowledging material risk of late slippage, I lower my estimate to 35% (down from 40%).",
