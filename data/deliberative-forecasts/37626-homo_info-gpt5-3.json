    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful recent point estimates (Jan–Mar 2025 reportedly in the low 62¢s) and highlights the tightness of the threshold and rounding risk. However, they largely omit the April 5, 2025 10% U.S. tariff on bananas, which is a material, near-term upward shock that likely passes through quickly for a fast-moving, perishable item. Given that even a 0.5–1.0¢ uptick would flip the outcome to No (and rounding at three decimals can turn ~0.6295 into 0.6300), 72% Yes seems too high. Forecaster 3’s reasoning is closer to my prior: recent upstream cost pressure (e.g., Dole’s commentary) and historically modest month-to-month volatility make a sub-$0.6300 print harder, with the new tariff adding downside for Yes. Their acknowledgment of promo-driven volatility is fair but likely insufficient to overcome the tariff and rounding headwinds.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers: (1) Tight threshold and rounding disadvantage (must be ≤0.629 to clear); (2) A 10% tariff effective Apr 5 likely lifts landed costs with relatively quick retail pass-through into May; (3) Bananas’ low volatility means even small cost increases can tip the series above 0.6300. Countervailing factors: bananas as a loss leader at major chains could dampen pass-through, and if Jan–Mar really were ~62.1–62.5¢, the starting point is favorable for Yes. Netting these, I still see No as more likely, but I nudge up slightly from my prior to reflect the possibility that early-2025 lows persist and retailers hold the line in May. I would move higher if the April print (out May 14) is ≤0.628; I would move lower if it’s ≥0.634 or if reports confirm broad pass-through of the tariff in May pricing.",
