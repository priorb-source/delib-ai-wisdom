  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025, when Metaculus will check the NUFORC database to determine if a qualifying pilot report from South America in June 2025 has been posted",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No pilot report from South America in June 2025. The status quo is that such reports are rare - South American reports to NUFORC average only 1-2 per year total, and the specific subset of pilot reports from this region represents an even smaller fraction",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any pilots in South American countries observing or reporting UFOs to NUFORC. Either no unusual aerial phenomena are observed by pilots in the region during June, or any observations go unreported to NUFORC due to language barriers, preference for local reporting systems, professional concerns, or simple lack of awareness of the NUFORC platform",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A pilot operating in a South American country (such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, or another nation on the continent) observes unexplained aerial phenomena during a flight in June 2025. The pilot overcomes potential barriers like the English-language reporting form and submits a report to NUFORC, which then posts it to their database under the pilot report category with a June 2025 date",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. According to the research assistant, NUFORC receives approximately 50-60 pilot reports worldwide annually (1% of 5,000-6,000 total reports), with only 3-5 non-US pilot reports per year globally. South American countries collectively average 1-2 reports per year total (not necessarily all from pilots). If we assume South American pilot reports represent roughly 20-30% of non-US pilot reports, this yields approximately 0.6-1.5 South American pilot reports annually. For any single month, this translates to roughly 5-12.5% probability. There is precedent for such reports - Brazil had a sighting in December 2024 and a Chilean Air Force crew reported in February 2023 - confirming that South American pilots do occasionally report to NUFORC. However, significant barriers exist: NUFORC is US-based with an English-language form, South American pilots may prefer local reporting channels, and professional concerns may discourage reporting. June represents only 1/12 of the year, a narrow window. The increased global awareness of UAP due to US government disclosure efforts could marginally increase reporting likelihood, but this effect is likely modest for a US-based platform receiving international reports. My forecast is not higher because the base rate is definitively low and the structural barriers to reporting remain significant. It's not lower because there is documented precedent of recent South American pilot reports, and the probability is non-trivial over a full month. To update higher, I would need evidence of increased South American pilot reporting trends in recent months or news of unusual aerial activity in the region. To update lower, I would need confirmation that recent South American reporting has declined or that the few historical reports were anomalous outliers",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
