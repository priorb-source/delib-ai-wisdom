    "review": "I found the reasoning of the other two forecasters very compelling, and their analyses highlighted two key points I had not sufficiently weighted. Forecaster 2 made a sharp and crucial distinction between eliminating the *program* and taking down the *website*, noting that the latter often persists long after the former ceases to function. This argument about institutional precedent and process is strong. Forecaster 3 provided the most decisive argument for me: a detailed analysis of the resolution criteria. The fact that the question resolves 'Yes' even if the site is just a redirect or a static landing page stating the program is discontinued is a game-changer. This dramatically lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome and aligns with the path of least resistance for a government agency.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on a tension between the stated political intent to eliminate the program and the force of bureaucratic inertia. After reviewing the other forecasts, I believe I significantly underestimated the probability of the website remaining online. The most impactful argument, raised by Forecaster 3, is that the resolution criteria are met even if the website is merely a static page or a redirect. The easiest and fastest way for the EPA to comply with a directive to eliminate the program online is not to fully decommission the servers and domain—a complex process—but to replace the active site with a simple informational page. This action would still resolve as 'Yes'. This insight, combined with Forecaster 2's valid points about the slow pace of government decommissioning and potential archival requirements, makes the 'Yes' outcome far more likely than I first estimated given the very short timeline of less than two months. The primary risk of a 'No' outcome is a politically-motivated, top-down order for a rapid and complete takedown for symbolic reasons, which would require overriding normal bureaucratic processes. While this risk is real, it is an exception to the rule. Therefore, I am substantially increasing my forecast from 75% to 90%.",
