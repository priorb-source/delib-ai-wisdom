  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (60 days) from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia continues at Level 3 through July 1, 2025. The regional conflicts in Tigray, Amhara, and other areas remain localized without spreading to major cities or threatening the capital. No major incidents occur involving American citizens, and US embassy operations continue normally. The State Department's next periodic review maintains the current advisory level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security deterioration occurs: widespread violence spreads to Addis Ababa, a major attack targets foreigners or US citizens, the US orders evacuation of embassy staff, the international airport closes, or a coup attempt destabilizes the national government. Any of these catalysts would trigger an immediate upgrade to Level 4.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. Historically, only 2-4 countries out of 25-35 at Level 3 get upgraded to Level 4 annually, representing roughly a 7-10% annual rate, or about 1-2% over a 2-month period. Ethiopia was just reviewed on April 30, 2025 and kept at Level 3 despite known regional conflicts. The State Department downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023, indicating an improving trajectory. However, several concerning factors warrant a probability higher than the pure base rate: (1) US sanctions announced May 1, 2025 regarding renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara regions signal active concern; (2) Multiple regions within Ethiopia already carry Level 4 warnings due to localized conflicts; (3) Neighboring countries Sudan and South Sudan have Level 4 advisories, indicating regional instability. That said, crucial catalysts for Level 4 upgrades are absent: no reports of nationwide offensives, coup attempts, mass-casualty events involving foreigners, or embassy evacuations. The violence remains regionally contained, not threatening the capital or major tourist/business areas. The recent State Department review maintaining Level 3 status is strong evidence against imminent upgrade. My forecast is not higher because: the base rate of upgrades is very low, Ethiopia was just reviewed and kept at Level 3, the trajectory has been improvement since 2023, and no clear immediate catalyst exists. My forecast is not lower because: active multi-region conflicts persist, recent sanctions indicate ongoing US concern, and some areas already have Level 4 designations showing the potential for escalation. I would update higher if: violence spreads to Addis Ababa, Americans are killed or taken hostage, embassy staff are evacuated, or a coup/major political crisis occurs. I would update lower if: peace negotiations advance, violence de-escalates in coming weeks, or the next State Department review explicitly confirms Level 3 status.",
