  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 13 days. The May 2025 data will be released and checked on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The status quo strongly favors a positive outcome, as US industrial production has shown accelerating year-over-year growth from -0.2% in January to +1.49% in April 2025, with four consecutive months of improvement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A No outcome would require May 2025's industrial production level to be equal to or lower than May 2024's level. This could occur if there was a severe manufacturing disruption in May, a sudden collapse in oil extraction/processing (which drove April's gains), or if the concerning signals from the Leading Economic Index drop and global slowdown materialize into an immediate industrial contraction. Another possibility is significant data revisions or seasonal anomalies.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A Yes outcome occurs if May 2025's industrial production exceeds May 2024's level by any amount. Given the strong momentum (April was +1.49% YoY), May could experience slower growth or even a month-over-month decline while still maintaining positive year-over-year growth. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI remaining above 50, continued oil sector strength, and the auto assembly rebound support this scenario.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a positive outcome. The trend from January through April shows clear acceleration: -0.2%, +0.45%, +0.85%, +1.49%. This momentum means May would need to fall significantly below May 2024 levels to register negative or zero YoY growth, which is unlikely in a 13-day timeframe. The oil sector strength that drove April's gains and the manufacturing PMI readings above 50 suggest continued, if potentially moderating, growth. However, I'm not forecasting above 85% because of several concerning indicators: the LEI fell 1.0% (largest drop since March 2023), core PPI declined for the first time since 2020, civil non-energy processing industries have been declining for months, and global demand appears to be weakening (China's PMI contractionary, slowing oil consumption growth forecasted). These suggest underlying weakness that could manifest in May's data. The mixed hard data proxies (flat manufacturing hours, rail/electricity tracking similar to April) indicate neither strong growth nor contraction. For me to forecast higher, I would need to see the concerning LEI and PPI signals proven wrong or see strong May preliminary indicators. For a lower forecast, I would need evidence of actual May manufacturing disruptions or dramatic deterioration in forward indicators. Given the strong status quo bias toward continuation and the high bar needed for reversal, 80% appropriately balances the positive momentum against the warning signs.",
