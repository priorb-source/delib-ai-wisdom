    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a 5-8% probability range with similar reasoning: the extremely short timeframe, the junta's established consolidation pattern, and lack of evidence of imminent reversal pressure. Forecaster 2 and 3 raised important points I had underweighted. Specifically, Forecaster 3's observation about Mali's withdrawal from ECOWAS is crucial - this significantly reduces the effectiveness of regional pressure mechanisms that might otherwise compel a reversal. Forecaster 3 also noted this dissolution followed earlier party activity suspensions, indicating deliberate escalation rather than an impulsive decision. Forecaster 2's point about the junta's ability to pivot to alternative international partners (implicitly Russia and others) reduces Western sanction leverage. These factors suggest the path to reversal is even narrower than I initially assessed. However, all forecasters appropriately leave room for unexpected developments - military splits, severe economic shocks, or IFI conditionality - which prevents going below 5%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting slightly downward based on two key considerations. First, Mali's ECOWAS withdrawal substantially weakens regional pressure mechanisms that historically have influenced West African governments. This removes a critical lever that might force a quick reversal. Second, the pattern of escalation from suspension to full dissolution suggests the May 13 decree was a calculated step in power consolidation, not a hasty decision likely to be reversed. The junta has also demonstrated capacity to pivot away from Western partners, reducing sanction effectiveness. The 40-day window remains extraordinarily short for meaningful pressure to build and force a reversal. I maintain a probability above 5% because: (1) authoritarian regimes occasionally make tactical concessions to relieve pressure; (2) unexpected shocks like major protests, military fractures, or acute economic crises can emerge rapidly; (3) potential IFI conditionality linking disbursements to political liberalization could theoretically prompt swift action. However, absent any current evidence of such catalysts, the status quo of maintaining the ban remains overwhelmingly likely.",
