    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same core evidence and reached similar analytical frameworks: strong deal infrastructure (November 2024 training, February 2023 Defense Minister visit, 'final stages' in January 2025) versus the concerning Q1 timeline miss with only 2 months remaining. The key disagreement centers on weighting these competing signals.\n\nForecaster 3's argument for 62% rests on the premise that 'if the deal was genuinely in final stages 4 months ago, two more months should be sufficient to announce' and that the extensive groundwork suggests real progress rather than wishful thinking. This is compelling - the Vietnamese troop training in November 2024 particularly indicates serious commitment beyond mere diplomatic courtesy.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 2's and my emphasis on status quo bias has merit: the Q1 miss is concrete evidence that the timeline was either overstated or complications emerged. Defense deals commonly experience cascading delays, and the absence of any May updates confirming progress is itself informative.\n\nThe central tension is whether the Q1 miss indicates minor administrative delays (supporting ~60%) or more fundamental obstacles (supporting ~45%). Neither interpretation is clearly superior given available evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find Forecaster 3's point about deal infrastructure strength somewhat persuasive - the November 2024 training program is particularly strong evidence of advanced preparation that goes beyond typical early-stage negotiations. However, I maintain that the Q1 miss must carry significant weight. If negotiations were truly in 'final stages' in January, a May announcement would have been natural. The silence suggests either the January reports overstated readiness or meaningful complications arose.\n\nThe key insight is that 'final stages' for a $300M defense deal between nations without prior arms trade history likely means weeks-to-months, not days. Four months passing without announcement thus represents a meaningful failure of expectations rather than normal variance.\n\nThat said, two months remains plausible time for announcement if administrative rather than substantive issues caused delays. I'll update slightly upward from 48% to acknowledge the strength of the deal infrastructure argument while maintaining that status quo considerations and the timeline miss prevent confidence above 50%.",
