Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues operating privately, does not post any IPO-planning announcement in the news section of its website, and does not publicly file an S-1 before July 1, 2025 (e.g., it opts for a later 2025/2026 timeline or only submits a confidential draft without a public press release).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, Databricks either (a) publicly files an S-1 with the SEC, or (b) posts in the News section of its website that it is planning an IPO, such as announcing a confidential submission of a draft registration statement for a proposed IPO.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and baseline: With only ~39 days left, the status quo favors No. Large, late-stage tech companies typically publicly file an S-1 only weeks before the roadshow/IPO. If Databricks targets a fall window, a public S-1 in June is less likely. A confidential draft could be filed without immediate public disclosure, which would not resolve Yes unless they announce it on their news page.\n- Data + AI Summit (June 9–12, 2025): This major company event makes a pre-summit S-1 even less likely due to communications constraints once an S-1 is on file. A post-summit window exists (roughly 2.5 weeks), but that is still a short fuse for a public S-1 if they aim for later in 2025. Announcing a confidential submission via a press release on their site could happen, but many firms keep confidential submissions quiet until closer to the roadshow, lowering odds.\n- Leadership signaling and market context: The CEO said 2024 was a “dumb” year to IPO and floated 2025/2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 note that an IPO within a year “wouldn’t be a huge surprise” keeps 2025 in play but doesn’t imply imminence by July 1. The 2025 IPO window is better than 2024 and AI sentiment is strong, but Databricks is reportedly well-capitalized, reducing urgency to move in the next 39 days.\n- Resolution criteria: The bar is clear and relatively strict: either a public S-1 or a news-page announcement. Rumors or third-party media won’t count. One path that would count is a company-posted release that it has confidentially submitted a draft S-1; some companies do this, but many don’t until closer to the offering.\n- Why not higher: Short time left; likely preference for a later-2025 filing; communications constraints around the mid-June summit; possibility they confidentially file without publicizing it.\n- Why not lower: The IPO window in 2025 is improving; Databricks is a prime AI beneficiary and could want to capitalize on market appetite; they could choose to announce a confidential submission on their news page, which would satisfy the criterion.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of bank mandates tied to a near-term timeline; hiring moves consistent with imminent IPO; a PR template or placeholder appearing on their news site; strong late-May/June IPO prints; any Databricks blog/news language foreshadowing a filing.\n- What would move me down: Fresh CEO/CFO comments pointing to 2026 or “not this summer”; market volatility or IPO pullbacks; large financing that reduces need to IPO soon; regulatory or operational issues.\n- Research assistant highlights considered: Upcoming June 9–12 summit (key external focal point), CEO’s earlier comments about timing flexibility (2025/2026), and sentiment that a 2025 IPO wouldn’t be surprising, all supportive of eventual IPO but not necessarily before July 1, 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
