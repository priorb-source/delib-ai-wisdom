    "review": "Both forecasters broadly align with my priors that a June Russia visit is unlikely given lead times, optics, and security. New points I hadn’t explicitly weighed: Forecaster 2’s note about mutual invitations and prior May 9 speculation (which modestly supports a general meeting sometime in 2025 but not specifically in Russia in June), and Forecaster 3’s point about Trump’s late‑May hardening rhetoric and a stated two‑week observation period (which meaningfully lowers the odds of an immediate conciliatory move like a Moscow trip). I find Forecaster 3’s argument especially persuasive for the near-term window: harsher rhetoric plus a wait‑and‑see stance is inconsistent with quickly scheduling a high‑profile Russia visit. Forecaster 2’s mention of SPIEF and possible Europe travel are plausible hooks but still feel too weak given the lack of credible reporting and the diplomatic/security hurdles. Overall, their input nudges me slightly down from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about one month, and there are no credible signals of an imminent presidential trip to Russia. The June 2 Istanbul talks function as a gating event; even if they exceed expectations, the first follow‑on meeting is more likely on neutral ground than in Russia on short notice. The White House has signaled no delegation for June 2 and no planning cues for Russia travel. Forecaster 3’s added information on Trump’s recent critical remarks toward Putin and a two‑week observation period further reduces the plausibility of a rapid, Russia‑based summit in June. Tail risk remains due to Trump’s unpredictability and mutual invitations, but absent leaks about logistics/advance teams, NOTAMs, or official readouts naming Moscow/St. Petersburg in June, the base case is No. I would move up quickly on credible reporting of a June Russia venue tied to a breakthrough framework; I would move down if Istanbul yields little or if a subsequent summit is announced for a third country or after June.",
