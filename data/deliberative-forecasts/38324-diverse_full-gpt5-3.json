    "review": "- New points from peers:\n  • F2 assumes a deal right by 6/27 and sums a ~$600B “replenishment jump” plus ~$200B of monthly deficit to reach ~$37T. \n  • F3 emphasizes that ordinary deficit growth is mostly irrelevant under extraordinary measures and leans on BPC’s later X‑date window to argue Congress may wait past 6/27.\n- What I find convincing:\n  • F3’s focus on the binding constraint (debt limit) and BPC’s mid‑July–early Oct window aligns with historical behavior—Congress often resolves closer to the true X‑date. \n  • The magnitude requirement (≈$800B) by 6/27 remains steep unless a deal lands at least several business days earlier with rapid issuance and trust fund restoration.\n- Pushback on F2:\n  • Potential double‑counting: the observed ~+$600B week‑one jump post‑2023 deal already reflected both intragovernmental replenishment and early TGA rebuild; separately adding a “month’s deficit” risks counting needs that are already embedded in the rebuild. \n  • Timing risk: Even if a deal hits on 6/27, intragovernmental restoration and large bill/CMB settlements may post the next business day (as in 2023), which would miss the 6/27 reading.\n- Net effect: I modestly increase my probability to reflect the specific “around 6/27” guidance from Treasury, but I still weight a later resolution and/or operational timing slippage as the base case.",
    "rationale": "To clear ≥$37T from ≈$36.2T requires ≈$0.8T of reported increase by the 6/27 close. That’s only feasible if:\n- Congress enacts a suspension/raise by roughly the week of 6/16–6/20, enabling:\n  • Immediate intragovernmental replenishment (a few hundred billion), and\n  • Rapid bill/CMB issuance and TGA rebuild with settlements before or on 6/27 (another few hundred billion).\n\nConstraints that keep the probability modest:\n- Political timing: BPC’s X‑date window (mid‑July–early Oct) implies less urgency to resolve by 6/27. Historically, Congress often moves near the actual X‑date. \n- Operational timing: In 2023 the first big jump posted the next business day after enactment. A 6/27 deal risks the main accounting increase appearing on 6/30, missing the target date. \n- Magnitude: Achieving ≥$800B by 6/27 likely requires an early‑to‑mid‑June deal plus unusually heavy, fast issuance; while possible with CMBs, it’s not the modal outcome.\n\nScenario weights (rough):\n- No deal by 6/27 (~70%): reported debt pinned ≈$36.2T → No. \n- Deal by ~6/18–6/20 with aggressive issuance and replenishment (~15%): plausible path to ≥$37T by 6/27 → Yes. \n- Deal on/after 6/24 or on 6/27 with most effects posting after 6/27 (~15%): likely miss the date → No.\n\nThis supports a modest uptick from my prior 12% to reflect the non‑trivial chance of an earlier deal and fast execution, while keeping the forecast below F3’s 20% only slightly because of the same timing/magnitude hurdles and the next‑business‑day posting risk.",
