    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (summit scheduled for June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits; Trump attended NATO summits in his prior term as president.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump skips and sends the Vice President or Secretary of State due to a domestic crisis, health issue, or a deliberate snub to increase leverage over allies on defense spending.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague, participates in leader sessions, photo ops, and bilaterals, and uses the platform to pressure allies on defense spending and burden-sharing.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: NATO summits are heads-of-state events, and U.S. presidents nearly always attend. In Trump’s previous term, he attended NATO summits despite frictions, using them to press allies. Institutional and diplomatic incentives strongly favor attendance, and the costs of a no-show are high. Timing: We are only weeks out; absent reports of a planned skip, the default is attendance. Countervailing risks: Trump’s unpredictability, potential desire to signal displeasure with NATO, and possible domestic or health contingencies could lead to a late change or delegation to the VP/State. The venue being The Hague (home to the ICC) is unlikely to change the calculus given head-of-state immunity and U.S. non-membership in the Rome Statute. What would move me up: credible reporting or official schedule confirming Trump’s travel; pre-summit bilateral announcements; logistics sightings. What would move me down: reports he will send a surrogate; emerging domestic crisis; health concerns; public statements conditioning attendance on unmet demands. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the host/location; thus I rely on base rates, recent precedent, and near-term timing to weight the status quo outcome more heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
