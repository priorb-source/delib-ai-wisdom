    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the foundational evidence: President Trump's second term has seen a dramatic increase in clemency actions compared to his first, an operational infrastructure is in place to support this, and recent reports signal more are planned. The core disagreement centers on how to interpret the late-May 'clemency blitz' of 25+ pardons. I initially viewed this as proof of high momentum. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument that this could be a 'batching' event that clears the pipeline and leads to a temporary lull in June, pulling their forecast down to 65%. Forecaster 3, at 77%, acknowledges this possibility but weighs the overall momentum more heavily, which is closer to my initial position. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning about a potential 'post-blitz lull' very convincing; it articulates a specific and plausible mechanism for a 'No' outcome that I had not fully weighted. This 'batching' dynamic is a much stronger argument for a pause than vague notions of a 'summer slowdown.'",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am slightly decreasing my forecast. The primary reason is the compelling argument, raised most forcefully by Forecaster 2, that the large number of clemencies granted in late May could represent a 'batch' that satisfies immediate demand and leads to a quieter June. This introduces a specific, plausible scenario for a 'No' outcome that I had previously understated. While I still believe the overall high tempo of clemency actions in this second term is the most predictive factor, the batching hypothesis is strong enough to warrant moderation. I am not lowering my forecast to 65% because reports from May 28th, issued concurrently with the 'blitz,' explicitly stated that more pardons are forthcoming. This signaling counteracts the idea that the May batch was a final act before a long pause. My updated forecast of 70% reflects a balance: the high-clemency environment remains the baseline expectation, but I now assign a greater probability to June falling into a temporary lull between major batches of presidential action.",
