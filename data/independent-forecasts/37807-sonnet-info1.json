  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - 'snack foods' remains explicitly listed on the USDA 'What Can SNAP Buy?' webpage, as it is confirmed to be there as of May 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USDA removes the explicit mention of 'snack foods' from the webpage between now and July 1, 2025, potentially as part of SNAP reforms announced during Secretary Rollins' late May reorganization announcement. This could involve restructuring the eligible items list to exclude or de-emphasize categories like snack foods in alignment with 'Make America Healthy Again' messaging.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The USDA maintains the current webpage language through July 1, 2025. Even if policy reforms are announced or discussed, the actual webpage text remains unchanged either because implementation takes longer than 6 weeks, or because any restrictions are framed as additions/clarifications rather than removing the explicit 'snack foods' category from the eligible items list.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors YES since 'snack foods' is currently explicitly listed. Government webpages typically change slowly, and only 6 weeks remains until resolution. While there are concerning signals - Secretary Rollins supporting SNAP reforms, the NY Post article about potential bans, and an upcoming USDA reorganization announcement in late May 2025 - actually implementing policy changes and reflecting them on the webpage would require formal regulatory or legislative processes that typically take longer than this timeframe. Even if reforms are announced in late May, the administration would likely need to: conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking, coordinate across offices, complete legal review, and ultimately update the website. The timeframe is very compressed. Additionally, 'snack foods' is a broad category that might be retained even if specific restrictions are added - the page could be modified to add clarifications or restrictions without removing the explicit mention. The political will for change exists, but bureaucratic inertia and procedural requirements make rapid fundamental changes less likely. I'd increase my forecast if evidence emerges of expedited rulemaking processes or if the late May announcement includes immediate effective dates for eligibility changes. I'd decrease it if the late May announcement passes without major SNAP eligibility changes or if news suggests reforms will take longer to implement than expected.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
