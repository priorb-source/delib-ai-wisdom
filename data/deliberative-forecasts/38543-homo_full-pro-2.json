    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core elements of the question. We all identify the extremely tight timeline and the immense logistical and security preparations required for a presidential visit as the primary drivers for a low probability. We also all correctly identify Donald Trump's history of unconventional, last-minute diplomacy as the main reason the forecast is not zero. The other forecasters' analyses made me reconsider two points: the hard deadline of the July 8 tariffs as a powerful motivating factor for a meeting, and the possibility of a 'no-frills' visit designed to bypass some of the usual lengthy protocol. Their reasoning on these points is convincing and suggests that a purely protocol-based dismissal of the visit might be too rigid when dealing with this specific actor. However, I believe their 10% forecast underweights the non-negotiable security and logistical realities. Even a 'no-frills' visit requires a significant and observable security footprint (US Secret Service advance teams, equipment, etc.), and the complete absence of any public reporting on this is the most powerful piece of evidence we have. While they are right to flag the possibility of a surprise, I believe a 1-in-10 chance of overcoming these massive, tangible barriers in the next 15 days is too high.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains anchored in the overwhelming logistical improbability of arranging a US presidential visit to China in the 16 days remaining. Such visits require weeks or months of advance work by security and diplomatic teams. The complete lack of any public reports indicating that such preparations are underway is the strongest evidence for a 'No' outcome. Furthermore, both leaders have conflicting international travel schedules in late June, narrowing the window of opportunity to an almost impossible sliver. However, after reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am updating my forecast. They correctly emphasized the pressure created by the July 8 tariff deadline and Trump's documented preference for dramatic, norm-breaking diplomatic events. This makes a hastily arranged 'surprise summit' to sign the trade deal a more plausible, albeit still remote, scenario than I had initially calculated. I am therefore increasing my forecast from 2% to 5%. This adjustment gives more weight to the 'unconventional actor' variable. I am not raising it to 10% because the physical and security requirements for a presidential visit are not just matters of protocol that can be waived; they are hard constraints. The absence of any advance team activity remains a near-fatal obstacle to the 'Yes' scenario, making a 5% probability the most defensible position.",
