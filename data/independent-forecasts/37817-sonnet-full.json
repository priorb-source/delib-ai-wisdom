  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "41 days (from May 21, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently there appear to be 4-5 regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current flight network remains stable with 4-5 destinations (Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane, and possibly Hong Kong). No new airlines launch routes before July 1, and the confirmed United Airlines Narita route doesn't commence until October 29, well after the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Hong Kong Airlines is confirmed to operate scheduled flights (establishing a 5th destination), and at least one or two additional routes materialize quickly - perhaps through conversion of charter flights to scheduled service, resumption of suspended Korean routes, or surprise announcements of new services with very short lead times.",
    "rationale": "Based on the research, as of early 2024 there were 4-5 regularly scheduled destinations. The confirmed current destinations are: Guam (United), Manila (United), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas, launched February 2025). This gives us 4 solid destinations. Hong Kong Airlines is mentioned as listing Koror, but it's unclear if this is an active scheduled service or aspirational - this could be a 5th. To reach 'greater than 5' (meaning 6+), we need 1-2 additional routes within 41 days. The key constraint is timing: United's new Narita route starts October 29, 2025, after the July 1 resolution date. JAL resumed charter flights in March 2025, but charters typically don't count as scheduled direct flights unless they operate on a regular published schedule. The tourism recovery context suggests gradual expansion rather than rapid route additions. Airlines typically announce international routes months in advance for operational and regulatory reasons. With only 6 weeks until resolution and no announcements of imminent new routes (besides the post-resolution United flight), the probability of reaching 6+ destinations is below 50%. However, it's not negligible because: (1) Hong Kong service might already be active, (2) there could be unreported routes in the current network, (3) charter services might qualify if regularly scheduled. The forecast would increase if evidence emerged of Hong Kong Airlines operating scheduled service or if any airline announced a quick-start route. It would decrease if confirmation showed only 4 established destinations with no realistic path to adding 2 more by July 1.",
