    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The data for May 2025 is scheduled for release around June 15, 2025, at which point the outcome will be known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data for April 2025 showed positive year-over-year growth of 1.49%. Given the high degree of inertia in this economic data series, the status quo is a continuation of this positive growth.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if there was a sharp, negative shock to the industrial sector in May 2025. This could be triggered by a major supply chain disruption, a significant labor strike, or a sudden drop in demand. Alternatively, unseasonably mild weather could severely depress the utilities component, pulling the total index into negative year-over-year territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is the most likely scenario, where the modest economic momentum from April continues into May. In this scenario, manufacturing, mining, and utility outputs remain stable or grow slightly, ensuring the year-over-year growth rate stays above zero in the absence of any major economic disruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily anchored on the most recent data and the principle of economic inertia. The year-over-year (YoY) industrial production growth for April 2025 was +1.49%, providing a substantial positive buffer. Over a short, one-month forecast horizon, it is highly probable that this trend will persist. It is rare for a macroeconomic indicator like this to swing from solid positive growth to negative YoY growth in a single month without a clear, significant, and widely-reported shock.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 92% because of several potential downside risks. The utilities component of the index is weather-sensitive, and an unusually mild May could drag down the total index. There is also a non-zero probability of an unforeseen shock, such as a natural disaster or a sudden halt in a major industry, that could have occurred in May. Finally, the question will resolve based on the preliminary data release, which can be subject to statistical noise.\n\nConversely, my forecast is not lower because a 'No' outcome is statistically unlikely. For the YoY growth to turn negative, the May 2025 index level would have to fall below the May 2024 level. Given the +1.49% YoY reading in April, this would require a very large month-over-month decline in May, an event typically associated with the onset of a recession or a major sector-specific crisis, for which there are no current indications.\n\nI would raise my forecast if high-frequency data for May (e.g., weekly electricity output, regional manufacturing surveys) confirmed continued stability or growth. I would significantly lower my forecast if information came to light about a major disruptive event that impacted US industrial capacity during May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
