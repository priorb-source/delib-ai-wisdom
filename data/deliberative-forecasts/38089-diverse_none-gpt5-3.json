    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete claim I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: an ~11-point Erdoğan lead in the latest Morning Consult read. Given the short timeline and the 7-day trailing average, that magnitude meaningfully lowers the crossover odds. Their inertia argument and tie-resolves-No point are strong. Forecaster 3’s 45% seems too high given typical month-to-month volatility and the likely direction of the base rates; it underweights the status quo and overweights generic uncertainty. I find F2’s reasoning more convincing because it’s anchored to a specific, recent gap and aligns with how slowly these trackers move absent a major shock.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~33 days. Status quo: Erdoğan leads, reportedly by about 11 points. With a 7-day trailing average and absent a discrete, highly salient event in Turkey or a broad, positive surge for Sánchez, a net 11+ point swing is unlikely over this horizon. Movements of 1–3 points per leader over a month are more common; simultaneous, same-direction moves large enough to flip a double-digit gap are rare. Scenarios for No: continuity of current trends; small drifts that keep Erdoğan ahead; a tie also resolves No. Scenarios for Yes: a sharp Turkish economic/political shock that dents Erdoğan several points quickly, coupled with steady or improving sentiment for Sánchez; or a Spanish political win that lifts Sánchez while Turkey drifts down—still a tall order given the starting gap. Given Forecaster 2’s new information on the current spread, I’m updating down from 23% to reflect the larger hurdle while keeping a small allowance for tail-risk shocks in Turkey and modest Spanish gains.",
