    "review": "- Forecaster 2 assumes the last filing showed exactly 10,000,000 shares and treats the question as requiring an active add; that conflicts with the assistant’s report and historical post-split figure of ~10.7M shares. If ~10.7M is correct, inaction implies a Yes, not a No. Their emphasis on Berkshire’s inertia actually strengthens the case for Yes under the stated threshold. \n- Forecaster 3 interprets the threshold as if current holdings are likely below 10M, which is inconsistent with the assistant’s baseline. They also lean on Berkshire’s cash-building to argue for a No, but trimming >0.7M AMZN shares would be immaterial to Berkshire’s cash pile and runs against the multi-year pattern of the AMZN stake being left largely untouched.\n- Neither forecaster provides evidence specific to AMZN trading in Q1 2025; both rely on generalized themes (cash accumulation, valuation discipline). Those themes raise some chance of broad-based trims, but not specifically the >0.7M reduction required for a No outcome if the baseline is ~10.7M.",
    "rationale": "Key points:\n- Baseline: Berkshire held roughly 10.7M AMZN shares as of Q4 2024 (consistent with the long-standing post-split count). The resolution says Yes if the Q1 2025 13F shows >10,000,000 shares. Therefore, inaction yields Yes. \n- What would produce No? A reduction of more than ~700k shares (~6–7%). Given Berkshire’s record cash build and net-selling trend, trims are possible, but the AMZN stake has been notably stable for years and is small relative to Berkshire’s portfolio. Selling >0.7M AMZN shares would raise only a modest ~$100–150M—rounding error vs. Berkshire’s $300B+ cash—so it’s an inefficient source of liquidity if the goal is cash accumulation. Historically, Berkshire has raised cash by trimming large positions (e.g., Apple) rather than micromanaging small ones.\n- No credible signals in the provided info suggest a targeted AMZN reduction or exit in Q1 2025. Confidential treatment is unlikely for this well-known, small position. \n- Downside risks: a strategic clean-up of minor tech positions or a full exit by the lieutenants is possible but not indicated. That tail risk (full or large partial exit) anchors the residual probability of No.\nGiven the above, the other forecasters’ arguments either rely on a misread baseline or conflate general portfolio caution with the specific, sizable cut needed here. I keep my estimate unchanged.",
