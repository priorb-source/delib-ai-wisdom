    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete Florida-specific edge (military ranges and recent high-profile UAP attention among military pilots) that I implicitly accounted for via Florida’s aviation density but did not call out explicitly. However, I’m cautious about how much that translates into NUFORC “pilot” submissions, given military pilots often use official channels rather than NUFORC. Their 25% seems high once we factor in the tie-to-No penalty and strong competitors (CA, TX). Forecaster 3’s equal-50-state base-rate argument (≈2%) is too low because pilot reports are concentrated in a small set of aviation-heavy states, but they rightly emphasize rarity, variance, and the tie penalty. Overall, 2’s argument modestly strengthens Florida’s case relative to a uniform view, while 3’s highlights the structural headwinds and wide competition. Net effect: my prior was already balancing these; I make a slight downward calibration for tie risk and dispersion across several top states.",
    "rationale": "I continue to forecast to the written criterion (June 2025). The event set is small (pilot-tagged reports), making ties common and the maximum count typically low (1–3), which penalizes the Yes outcome. Florida is a top contender due to very high GA/airline activity, major flight training, coastal routes, and frequent aerospace activity, but California and Texas are comparably strong, and single clusters elsewhere can outpace Florida in a given month. Forecaster 2’s military-range point is real but may only partially translate into NUFORC pilot submissions. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the large competitor set and tie risk is persuasive, though their uniform base rate is too pessimistic for Florida. Balancing these, I trim my estimate slightly to reflect the tie-to-No risk and competition across multiple top states. I would move up with early June indications of multiple Florida pilot-tagged reports or high-visibility phenomena over Florida; I would move down if CA/TX show early clusters or June proves generally quiet for Florida.",
