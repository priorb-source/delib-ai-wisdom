    "review": "Both forecasters center the key resolution nuance: it’s page-dependent and requires an explicit Tesla call-out on that specific BC Hydro page. They emphasize the main downside risk as a communications change to brand-agnostic wording or page reorganization, which would resolve No even if the underlying exclusion persists. They also note short time to July 1, political salience, and policy stickiness, all favoring persistence. The new angle I’m incorporating more explicitly is the nontrivial chance (they estimate ~25–30%) of a website wording change or page migration, independent of policy. I find their reasoning solid and largely consistent with mine, but it nudges me to weight the communications risk a bit more heavily.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is short (~1 month), and the underlying policy was recently implemented and publicly defended, which supports inertia. The broader BC posture (preference for Canadian goods; exclusion of U.S.-produced goods where practicable) and the political signaling suggest low odds of a substantive policy reversal by July 1. However, the question demands explicit mention of Tesla’s ineligibility on the exact home charger rebate page. That creates a real communication/path dependency risk: BC Hydro could update the page to brand-neutral eligibility language, move the brand-specific note to an FAQ/news page, or restructure the content, any of which would resolve No despite ongoing exclusion. I originally weighted inertia more heavily; after considering the others’ arguments, I’m increasing the probability of a wording or page-structure change slightly. Net effect: modest downward adjustment from 86% to 80%. Scenarios: No outcome if the page goes brand-agnostic or is reorganized without an explicit Tesla line; Yes outcome if the page retains or reiterates the Tesla-ineligible notice through July 1. I see the latter as more likely but not overwhelming given the communications risk.",
