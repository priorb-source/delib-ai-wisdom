    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments, and I find their analyses largely aligned with mine but with important nuances. Forecaster 2's 98% confidence is grounded in the direct evidence of Gbagbo's existing disqualification and the political trend of opposition exclusion. Forecaster 3's 90% forecast incorporates a crucial observation I underweighted: the prompt states 'criteria have not yet been satisfied,' suggesting the resolver sees some ambiguity despite the reporting. This could mean the resolver is waiting for more formal confirmation or distinguishes between historical removal from electoral lists and current candidacy-stage disqualification. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that multiple credible sources report Gbagbo's disqualification based on a 2018 conviction resulting in loss of civic rights, and both note the short timeframe makes reversal highly improbable. Forecaster 3's more measured approach, acknowledging this resolver ambiguity while still maintaining high confidence in the underlying facts, seems most appropriate. Forecaster 2's near-certainty may be slightly overconfident given the apparent need for additional confirmation.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative at 87%. The evidence for Laurent Gbagbo's disqualification is substantial - multiple credible news sources from late May 2025 confirm he remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction that resulted in loss of civic rights. This directly satisfies the resolution criteria of being 'removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run.' The political climate, with recent disqualifications of other opposition figures like Tidjane Thiam, reinforces that the government is maintaining a restrictive stance rather than becoming more inclusive. With only one month until July 1, 2025, reversal through amnesty, expedited appeals, or presidential pardon is highly improbable. However, I'm updating to 90% rather than 98% because the prompt's indication that 'criteria have not yet been satisfied' suggests the resolver may require more formal confirmation than news reports alone, or may distinguish between past removal and current candidacy status. There's a small but meaningful possibility that either Gbagbo's status could be reversed through unexpected political maneuvering, or the resolver might not count the current reporting as definitively satisfying the criteria.",
