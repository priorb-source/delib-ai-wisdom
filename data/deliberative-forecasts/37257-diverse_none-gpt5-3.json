    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core constraints I relied on: a long history of Dodik using referendum rhetoric without setting a date, high expected Western sanctions, and Belgrade’s likely discouragement given its EU ambitions. They add two useful clarifications: (1) the base rate for actually scheduling independence referendums in similar contexts is extremely low, and (2) any such announcement would be a sharp escalation with immediate costs, not just a symbolic gesture. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my priors. They did not provide new concrete signals of imminence, which further supports weighting the status quo. Their triggers for an update (e.g., an OHR move to remove Dodik, explicit Serbian endorsement) are appropriate and align with mine.",
    "rationale": "Given roughly two months left, the bar for a qualifying event—an authorized RS body announcing a specific date—is still high. The structural incentives remain: brinkmanship pays politically without the severe penalty an official scheduling would likely trigger; Serbia’s calculus likely discourages a date announcement; and there are no visible preparatory steps or leaks indicating imminence. However, I retain a small tail for a sharp shock leading to a date announcement (e.g., a new OHR imposition, adverse court action, or a deliberately timed, defiant move around a symbolic date like June 28). Balancing these, I’m nudging down slightly from 15% to reflect the strong base-rate arguments and the short window without signals, while keeping a modest premium for a late-stage escalation risk.",
