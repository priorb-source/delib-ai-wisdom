    "review": "Both forecasters center timing and the need for a special session, which I agree are the dominant constraints. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on institutional inertia and the rarity of special sessions for non-budget issues is reasonable. Forecaster 3’s framing is broadly sound, but their “within 56 days” enactment window isn’t Florida-specific; in Florida the governor generally has 7 days (or 15 days post-adjournment) after presentment, and inaction allows a bill to become law—so if a qualifying bill already passed, enactment could occur quickly. Neither added concrete evidence on the bill’s status. The absence of such signals, this late, is itself informative and pushes the probability down. I still factor in GOP alignment and the possibility of a quick enactment if something already passed, but I give more weight now to the session likely having ended without passage and the low base rate of calling a special session for this issue.",
    "rationale": "The question resolves Yes only if voters are newly required to provide documentary proof of citizenship (not just backend checks). That’s a high bar that has drawn litigation elsewhere, increasing political/operational friction. Florida’s regular session appears to have just ended or is ending, and we lack any indication that a qualifying provision cleared both chambers. If such a measure had passed, we would expect notable press and a short enactment timeline (signature or lapse into law within roughly two weeks of presentment). The lack of signals by May 6 makes the “already passed” scenario less likely. A special session is possible but uncommon absent urgent drivers, and leadership would be aware of legal risks under the NVRA. Balancing strong partisan alignment (which keeps some tail risk alive) against timing and base rates, I trim my estimate downward. I’d move up sharply with confirmation that a qualifying bill passed both chambers or a special session call naming this issue; I’d move down further with confirmation that the session adjourned sine die without passage and no special session plans.",
