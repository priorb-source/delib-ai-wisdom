  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Substantial late-June improvements on the U.S. Drought Monitor remove D1-D4 conditions from major population centers (e.g., Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Bay Area counties), dropping the statewide \"people in drought\" below 20.0 million on the June 26 update viewed by Metaculus on/after June 28.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal drying persists or worsens through late June, keeping D1-D4 coverage across Southern California, the Central Valley, and/or the Bay Area, so the \"people in drought\" figure stays at or above 20.0 million (and possibly increases) on the update visible when accessed on/after June 28.",
    "rationale": "- What we know now: The research assistant reports drought.gov lists approximately 22.7 million Californians in D1–D4 for the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor updates weekly. Earlier, water supply indicators were decent (Lake Oroville ~86% full; snowpack ~96% of normal on Mar 25; SWP allocation at 40%), but those do not directly determine USDM classifications, which integrate precipitation, soil/veg moisture, streamflow, and impacts.\n- Seasonal context: Late June is typically dry in California; meaningful multi-week improvements in USDM categories are uncommon absent anomalous late-season storms. With 22.7M already in drought, the figure would need to fall by roughly 2.7M to dip below 20.0M. That likely requires removing drought from large, dense metros (especially in Southern California), which is improbable in late June.\n- Status quo weight: Given the current margin above the threshold and the seasonal tendency for stability or deterioration into summer, the base case is that the number remains ≥20M by the June 26 USDM release (the version most likely visible on June 28).\n- Why not higher: There is residual risk that the USDM trims D1 in key populated counties (e.g., if recent conditions warranted reclassification), that late-season troughs provide localized relief, or that timing quirks (exact day/hour Metaculus accesses the page) coincide with a rare weekly dip just below 20M. The threshold is not extremely far away (~2.7M), so a moderate re-draw over urban counties could cross it.\n- Why not lower: The present reading is comfortably above the cutoff, and climatology favors persistence or expansion in June. Broad, rapid improvements across multiple metros in a single month are atypical.\n- What would change my view:\n  • Downward: Credible signals before June 26 that D1 is being removed across Los Angeles/Orange/San Diego or the Bay Area (weekly USDM outlooks, state impact reports), or a rare late-June wet pattern materially improving short-term indicators in those areas.\n  • Upward: Indications of expanding D1–D2 into additional population centers, early-season heat waves/dry spells worsening short-term indicators, or explicit USDM author commentary about continued degradation.\nSummary of assistant info used: Current \"people in drought\" ~22.7M (D1–D4) as of week of May 27; USDM updates weekly; earlier-year water supply indicators are decent but not determinative for USDM. These support a high probability that the count remains ≥20.0M by late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
