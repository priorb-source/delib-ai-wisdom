    "review": "Both forecasters present the same core evidence set I used: official White House confirmation, inclusion on participant lists, and visible Canadian security/airspace preparations. They add a couple of useful specificity points (e.g., monitoring NOTAMs, motorcade/airlift movements, and the president’s published press schedule), and explicitly cite age-related health risk and mechanical/weather delays as tail risks. No contradictory evidence was introduced. Their reasoning is consistent and well-calibrated for this stage.",
    "rationale": "The converging official signals (WH confirmation, G7 lists, security perimeters/airspace restrictions) and the high historical base rate for U.S. presidential attendance make attendance the clear default. The distance/logistics are straightforward, and even contentious summits historically do not deter in-person participation. Tail risks remain: sudden health issues, an acute domestic or foreign crisis requiring the president in Washington, credible security threats, or severe weather/aviation disruptions. Reports about a possible lack of a joint communiqué are largely orthogonal to attendance. Given no new adverse signals and some incremental planning evidence, I see no reason to adjust from a high-90s but not certain forecast. I will hold at 94% and would move higher upon release of detailed WH travel guidance and observable aviation/motorcade movements; I’d move lower on credible reports of illness, crisis, or security-driven format changes.",
