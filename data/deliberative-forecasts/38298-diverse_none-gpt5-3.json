    "review": "Both forecasters stress the ENSO transition and the high bar set by recent Mays. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the likely shift to neutral/incipient La Niña is a valid headwind I may have underweighted in my initial 75%. Forecaster 3’s point about base rates (many but not all recent months breaking records) and the lack of preliminary May specifics is also salient—without early dataset confirmations, a tight race could easily land 2nd in NOAA. Neither provides new concrete data, but they rightly highlight two uncertainty drivers I should reflect: (1) NOAA’s tendency to diverge slightly from ERA5 in tight months and (2) the possibility that land temps softened enough relative to 2024 to miss the top spot by a few hundredths.",
    "rationale": "I still think the prior for a top-1 outcome remains elevated given persistent ocean warmth and lagged effects from the recent El Niño, but a top-1 call in NOAA specifically is a knife-edge event. The record to beat (likely May 2024) is high, and the ENSO transition could trim anomalies just enough to shift NOAA to 2nd even if other datasets show a record. The absence, as of June 2, of strong cross-dataset early signals further argues against very high odds. Balancing these, I’m revising down from 75% to 60%: above even odds due to the exceptional background warmth and marine heat, but tempered for ENSO cooling, the high bar, and NOAA’s methodological nuances in close months.",
