    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. They correctly emphasize the specificity and recency of the Claude Neptune reports - these are from May 15-16, 2025, citing red-team completion on May 18 with a late May/early June target. This is not vague speculation but concrete, dated information from credible sources. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point about the 14-month gap since Claude 3 (March 2024) being substantial even within a pattern of lengthening cycles, especially given competitive AI landscape dynamics. Both forecasters appropriately identify the naming risk as the primary uncertainty - if Anthropic brands this as Claude 3.5, Neptune, or anything other than 'Claude 4', the question resolves No regardless of release timing. I was overly anchored to status quo thinking and the historical pattern without fully weighing the strength of the recent, specific intelligence about an imminent release. However, I think 80% may slightly overweight the recent reports given: (1) the significant naming uncertainty - Anthropic could easily choose intermediate versioning, (2) tech release timelines frequently slip even after red-teaming, and (3) the fact that we only have leaks, not official announcements. The 75-80% range seems reasonable but perhaps slightly optimistic.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I significantly underweighted the evidence for a near-term release. The Claude Neptune reports are exceptionally specific (red-team completion May 18, late May/early June GA target) and recent (within days of today's date). Red-team completion is a major milestone that typically precedes launch by weeks, not months. The 6-week buffer until July 1 provides comfortable margin even with some slippage. Anthropic's historical pattern of making numbered releases publicly available within 48 hours of announcement, without waitlists, aligns with the resolution criteria. The competitive pressure in the AI space is real and substantial. However, the naming risk remains significant and perhaps underappreciated - there is no guarantee the next release will be called 'Claude 4' rather than 'Claude 3.5' or another designation. Software delays are common even after testing phases. My original 38% was too conservative and status-quo biased. The other forecasters' reasoning convinces me to update substantially upward, though I remain slightly more cautious than their 75-80% range due to the naming uncertainty and typical tech release unpredictability. A forecast around 68% better reflects the balance between strong release signals and meaningful residual risks.",
