  "information": "National polling data from late April 2025 indicates voting intentions place Reform UK at approximately 25%, Labour at 24%, and the Conservative Party at 22%. Reports suggest the Liberal Democrats are targeting Conservative-held areas with significant campaign resources, and the rise of Reform UK is expected to split the traditional Conservative vote.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days (polling 2 May 2025; most results expected by 3 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party by seats (though likely lose their current majority).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour sweeps most Northampton town wards and gains in Daventry town, while Liberal Democrats flip multiple rural/suburban wards in South Northamptonshire and Daventry. Reform UK splits the right-of-centre vote broadly enough that Conservatives fall behind Labour in total seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite heavy losses in Northampton, Conservatives retain a large share of rural and small-town three-member wards, limiting Lib Dem gains and surviving Reform’s vote split. Fragmentation among Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform means the Conservatives still edge out Labour as the single largest party, even without an overall majority.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2021 the Conservatives won a commanding lead in West Northamptonshire (a heavily rural unitary combining Daventry and South Northants with urban Northampton). The default, slow-to-change outcome is that they remain the largest party, even if their majority evaporates.\n\nWhat’s changed: National environment is strongly anti-Conservative. The research assistant notes late-April voting-intention snapshots putting Reform ≈25%, Labour ≈24%, Conservatives ≈22%, plus Lib Dem targeting of Conservative-held areas. That mix increases the risk that Conservatives lose many seats: Labour is poised for big gains in Northampton; Lib Dems can pick off Conservatives in rural/suburban wards; Reform’s presence can further erode Conservative first-place shares in three-member wards.\n\nCountervailing factors: Reform historically underperforms at local level due to candidate coverage and ground game; even when they stand, they often split votes rather than win seats. Opposition gains are split among Labour (urban Northampton), Lib Dems (many rural/suburban wards), and Greens/Independents. That fragmentation tends to leave Conservatives as the largest party by seat count, especially in predominantly rural authorities, even when they lose overall control. Ward geography also favors Conservatives outside Northampton; Labour becoming outright largest would require very strong gains beyond the core urban wards.\n\nWhy not higher: The national headwinds, Reform’s vote-splitting on the right, and targeted Lib Dem campaigning create a realistic path for the Conservatives to slip to second if Labour racks up large urban tallies while Lib Dems clip many rural seats. That simultaneous two-front loss is plausible in 2025.\n\nWhy not lower: The Conservatives’ deep rural base and the multi-party opposition make it harder for any single party—especially Labour—to surpass them across the whole unitary. Reform’s votes often don’t convert into seats; they more commonly redistribute seat wins to Labour/Lib Dems rather than creating a single dominant challenger.\n\nKey updates I’d watch to move the forecast: \n- Evidence of Reform fielding near-full slates locally (downside for Conservatives), or conversely thin Reform coverage (upside for Conservatives).\n- Local ward-level polling/activist reports in Northampton, Daventry town, Towcester/Brackley corridors indicating Labour or Lib Dem surges strong enough to flip multiple three-member wards.\n- Candidate slate completeness for Labour/Lib Dems versus Conservatives.\n- Any late-breaking local issues or scandals affecting the Conservative brand locally.\n\nNet: Status quo inertia plus opposition fragmentation slightly outweigh national anti-Conservative sentiment for this specific question (largest party), so I lean modestly Yes.",
