    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint has not filed for bankruptcy and continues operations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint successfully manages its cash position through the next two months, potentially through cost reductions, asset sales, capital raises, or debt refinancing. The company continues normal operations without needing bankruptcy protection despite any financial challenges it may face.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces a severe liquidity crisis or cannot meet imminent debt obligations. The company exhausts financing options and files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure its operations and debts before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome, as ChargePoint has not filed for bankruptcy as of May 5, 2025. Good forecasting practice emphasizes that the world changes slowly - companies rarely file for bankruptcy suddenly within a 2-month window unless already in extreme distress. Base rates matter: even among financially struggling companies, the probability of bankruptcy filing in any given 2-month period is relatively low. ChargePoint operates in the capital-intensive EV charging infrastructure sector, which has faced industry-wide challenges including slower-than-expected EV adoption rates and profitability pressures. However, without specific evidence from the financial results report or additional information from my research assistant indicating imminent financial distress (such as going concern warnings, covenant breaches, or failed financing attempts), I must weight the status quo heavily. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: severe liquidity warnings, recent failed capital raises, imminent debt maturities that cannot be refinanced, or formal distressed company indicators. For it to be lower, I would need evidence of: successful recent financing, improved cash positions, or strategic transactions providing liquidity runway. The very short timeframe (under 2 months) also reduces probability, as bankruptcy filings typically follow extended financial deterioration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
