  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "There is no nuclear deal between the United States and Iran. Iran is enriching uranium to 60%, and extensive US economic sanctions remain in place. Indirect negotiations are ongoing.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The significant gap between the US's '14 red lines' (including complete dismantlement of the nuclear program) and Iran's insistence on maintaining a civilian enrichment program proves insurmountable. Domestic political pressure on both sides prevents necessary compromises, and the ongoing negotiations stall or collapse before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic momentum from the recent rounds of talks in Oman continues. Facing an impending deadline and motivated by US non-proliferation goals and Iran's need for sanctions relief, both sides make significant concessions. A compromise is reached where Iran agrees to drastically curb its enrichment activities and accept robust, long-term international monitoring in exchange for a phased lifting of key US sanctions, leading to a formal announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards an agreement being reached, primarily due to the significant diplomatic momentum and credible external reporting. The status quo is 'no deal', and the publicly stated positions of both nations are far apart, with the US demanding complete dismantlement and Iran protecting its right to a civilian program. This wide gap is the strongest argument against a deal. However, several factors indicate a high probability of a breakthrough. Firstly, there is a sustained series of high-level, indirect negotiations mediated by Oman, with both sides describing the talks with positive, albeit cautious, language like 'constructive' and 'converged'. This suggests genuine progress is being made behind the scenes. Secondly, the report from Israeli media, citing senior ministers who believe there is a 'high chance' of a deal, is a powerful piece of evidence. Israel has a vested interest and strong intelligence capabilities in this area, so their assessment carries significant weight. Thirdly, Iran's public proposals, including eliminating its highly enriched uranium stockpile and accepting enhanced oversight in return for the lifting of all sanctions, signal a serious and motivated negotiating partner. While President Trump's administration has maintained a hardline public stance and even imposed new sanctions, the fact that these intensive talks are proceeding under a reported two-month deadline set by him suggests a willingness to reach a deal that meets core US security objectives. The probability is not higher because the gap in stated positions remains vast, and either side could walk away if their core 'red lines' are not met. The imposition of new US sanctions during talks is a conflicting signal that could undermine trust. The forecast would be lower without the positive language from negotiators and the compelling Israeli intelligence report. I would increase my forecast if a direct meeting between US and Iranian foreign ministers occurs or if there are verified reports of a compromise on the key issues of enrichment levels and sanctions relief. I would decrease my forecast if the upcoming fifth round of talks is canceled or ends with public acrimony.",
