  "information": "The United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The ongoing conflict and hazardous operating environment for aid workers make it highly likely that at least 5 more UN staff will be killed in the next two months.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would require a sudden, comprehensive, and durable ceasefire to be implemented in early May 2025, leading to a dramatic reduction in violence that prevents any further UN staff fatalities before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the conflict continues at or near its current intensity. Ongoing military operations, airstrikes, or a breakdown in public order result in the deaths of at least 5 more UN staff members by the end of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The current reported number of UN staff fatalities stands at 295 as of April 30, 2025, just five short of the 300 threshold. With approximately two months remaining until the resolution date, the 'Yes' outcome is highly probable. The research assistant's report from early May 2025 paints a picture of a worsening, not improving, humanitarian and security situation, characterized by aid blockades, rising malnutrition, and ongoing insecurity. This environment is extremely dangerous for UN personnel on the ground. The historical casualty rate, with 295 fatalities over the preceding months, suggests a monthly average far higher than the 2.5 per month required to cross the threshold. The continuation of the status quo is the most direct path to a 'Yes' outcome. My confidence is not absolute (i.e., not 100%) to account for the small but non-zero possibility of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough leading to a lasting ceasefire. The forecast is not lower because the threshold is so small that even a significant de-escalation, short of a complete cessation of hostilities, would likely still result in the required five additional casualties. I would lower my probability upon verified news of a robust ceasefire agreement and update it higher if there were reports of a mass-casualty event involving UN staff.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
