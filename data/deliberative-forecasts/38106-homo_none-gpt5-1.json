    "review": "Both forecasters reiterate the key constraints: tiny remaining window, severe US–Russia strain, rarity of such visits, and the usual need for advance signaling. New/useful emphases they add: (1) early-term Moscow visits are uncommon and past ones happened in far less adversarial contexts; (2) Trump’s first-term pattern of meeting Putin in third countries instead of Russia; (3) schedule-based tells (official June schedule, Europe trip with an unspecified stop) as necessary precursors. I find their reasoning consistent with mine and persuasive; nothing contradicts my view, but their added points modestly strengthen the case for slightly lower odds.",
    "rationale": "The base case remains No. There is only one month left, and a presidential visit to Russia in the current geopolitical climate would entail high political and alliance-management costs, significant security/diplomatic prep, and would almost certainly generate credible press indications beforehand. None have surfaced. Trump’s unpredictability and appetite for theatrical diplomacy preserve a small tail for a surprise, particularly if tied to a breakthrough (ceasefire framework, large prisoner/hostage exchange). However, the combination of: (a) very short runway with no credible reporting or logistical tells; (b) poor bilateral climate; (c) precedent of using third countries for leader-level meetings; and (d) the likelihood that any June foreign travel would already be taking shape publicly, all push the probability down slightly from my prior. I keep it above 1% to reflect Trump-specific tail risk, but trim toward 2% given the additional context on timing, precedent, and scheduling signals highlighted by the other forecasters.",
