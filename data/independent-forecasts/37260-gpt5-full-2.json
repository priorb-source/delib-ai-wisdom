  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.\n\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.\n\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No application to ban the AfD is filed with the Federal Constitutional Court before July 1, or an application is filed but the court does not rule by then (which is the overwhelmingly likely timeline given such cases take many months to years).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major, consensus-shifting event prompts the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat to file immediately, and the Federal Constitutional Court takes the extraordinary step of fast-tracking and announcing a ban within weeks—an unprecedented acceleration of procedure.",
    "rationale": "- Process and timing: A party ban in Germany can only be declared by the Federal Constitutional Court upon application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat. As of early May 2025, per the research assistant, no formal application to ban the AfD has been filed. Historically, party-ban proceedings take a long time (the Bundesrat’s NPD case took years; the 2003 attempt failed procedurally; the 2017 attempt failed on substance). With ~60 days left, even an immediate filing would almost certainly not culminate in a final ban before July 1.\n- Political support: While 124 MPs led by Marco Wanderwitz put a motion on the agenda and 17 constitutional law experts voiced support, reports indicated the motion lacked majority support and no immediate decision followed the January 30 debate. The federal government and major parties appear divided on initiating a ban due to legal risk, timeline, and potential martyr effects. The Bundesrat is also unlikely to move swiftly. Without a filing, there can be no ban.\n- Substantive bar: The 2017 NPD precedent set a high bar: even if anti-constitutional aims are found, the court also weighs a party’s capability to undermine the democratic order. AfD currently polls around 25–26%, which cuts both ways: it indicates influence but also heightens political caution about banning a major party and the societal risks of such a move. The domestic intelligence classification (allowing surveillance) is significant but falls well short of a ban.\n- Status quo weight: The world changes slowly; the default is that no ban will be announced before July 1. Procedural lead times and lack of a filed case dominate near-term odds.\nWhy not higher: No application is on file; court timelines are long; political will for a ban is uncertain and likely insufficient pre–July 1; the court has shown caution in prior party-ban cases.\nWhy not lower (not absolute zero): A very small chance remains of an unexpected, dramatic event producing rapid political consensus and an emergency, expedited proceeding—though this would be unprecedented and still faces legal hurdles.\nWhat would move me up: - Public confirmation that the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat will file immediately, plus the Constitutional Court announcing an expedited schedule within days. - New, credible evidence tying the AfD to imminent violent or system-subverting actions that triggers a decisive, cross‑party response and court urgency. \nWhat would move me down: - Clear public statements from key actors (government, Bundestag leadership, Bundesrat) ruling out filing before July. - Court calendars or official announcements indicating no relevant case is pending or expedited. - Parliamentary scheduling showing no vote on such a motion before the deadline.",
