  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~66 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current constituents remain unchanged through June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no announcement of constituent changes; despite volatility and company-specific headlines, no component triggers a sector-balance or price-weighting adjustment, and there are no corporate actions forcing a swap.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The index committee announces a replacement before July 1, 2025, perhaps due to a corporate action (spin-off/merger), an extended slide leaving a component with an unusually low nominal price for a price-weighted index, or a desire to rebalance sector representation. Plausible, though not predicted, candidates would be a troubled industrial (e.g., if Boeing’s issues worsen materially), a post-spin laggard like 3M, or a low-priced telecom if the committee opts to switch to a higher-priced peer for weighting/representation reasons.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and timing favor No. DJIA changes are infrequent and typically cluster around clear catalysts: major corporate actions, very low nominal prices in a price-weighted index, or sector-representation adjustments. Over the past decade, changes occurred in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2024 (the most recent being Amazon and Nvidia added in Feb 2024). With only ~66 days left, absent a catalyst, the committee is unlikely to make another change so soon after the 2024 refresh.\n\nRisk factors exist but are not decisive. The research assistant notes recent sharp drawdowns (e.g., UNH, NKE, DIS, NVDA) and broader market volatility tied to tariffs and inflation. While these increase headline risk, the committee generally avoids reacting to short-term moves. Current nominal prices for the most pressured names (e.g., Disney, Nike, 3M, Verizon) are not yet in the extreme low range that historically prompted action (e.g., Walgreens). Corporate actions among constituents that would force a change are not clearly in train before July.\n\nWhy not higher? Near-term window is short; the last overhaul was only ~14 months ago; no clear, known corporate-action catalyst. Why not lower? A non-trivial tail remains: a surprise spin-off/merger, a steep further drop pushing a component’s price uncomfortably low for a price-weighted index, or a committee-driven sector rebalance.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reporting of a pending DJIA review/change; an announced spin-off/merger among constituents; a large split or a price collapse (e.g., sub-$30) for a component; or S&P DJI commentary on sector representation. What would move me down: stabilization into mid-June with no rumors, or recovery in the weakest names.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
