    "review": "New and useful points from the others: (1) Forecaster 2’s concrete list of DPRK weapons tests in 2025 (IRBM/HGV in Jan, strategic cruise missiles in Feb, Haeil-2 in Apr, and late-April weapons tests from a new destroyer) strengthens the case that Pyongyang is favoring below-threshold signaling this year. (2) Forecaster 3’s emphasis on closer DPRK–Russia ties and weakened UN enforcement slightly lowers the external cost of a nuclear test. (3) June 25 (Korean War anniversary) is a plausible focal date but historically not a strong predictor.\nI find both analyses broadly convincing and consistent with my prior view: no near-term OSINT indicators of last-mile Punggye-ri prep; capability exists; the time window is short. The new 2025 test activity nudges me down; the Russia/UN dynamic nudges me up. These effects roughly offset, leaving me comfortable near my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~2 months favors the status quo (No) unless concrete pre-test indicators emerge.\n- Capability: Punggye-ri remains assessed as usable; a test is technically feasible on short notice.\n- Indicators: Public OSINT (e.g., 38 North) has not flagged last-mile prep (sustained logistics, pumping, cabling, unusual security/VIP activity). Absent these, short-horizon odds stay low.\n- Behavior in 2025: Multiple missile/naval demonstrations suggest a continued preference for sub-nuclear signaling, modestly reducing near-term test likelihood.\n- Incentives/constraints: DPRK may want to validate new designs and signal resolve. External costs may be somewhat lower given Russia ties and weaker UN enforcement, but Chinese disapproval and broader diplomatic costs remain. Also, DPRK may prefer a later, more salient moment (e.g., autumn) outside this window.\nNet: Feasible but not indicated; short window; mixed incentives. I keep a low, non-zero probability.",
