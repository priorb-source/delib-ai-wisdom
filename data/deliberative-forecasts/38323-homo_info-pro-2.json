    "review": "All forecasters, including myself, correctly identified the strong negative momentum and prevailing headwinds as the primary drivers pointing towards a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 provided useful context by highlighting specific negative catalysts like trade tariffs and cautious Federal Reserve commentary, which reinforced my initial bearish view. However, Forecaster 2's analysis was the most impactful. They introduced a crucial quantitative argument that I had overlooked: the starting baseline for the index is 52.2, meaning a historically rare jump of nearly 8 points is required for a 'Yes' outcome. The evidence that an increase of this magnitude has occurred less than 3% of the time historically is a powerful anchor. This reframes the question from a simple directional forecast to a prediction on a low-probability event. I found this reasoning highly convincing as it grounds the forecast in historical data and quantifies the scale of the challenge for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am significantly lowering my probability from 40% to 20%. My initial forecast was too high because I did not sufficiently account for the low starting baseline of the index and the historical rarity of the required monthly increase. Forecaster 2's point that the index would need to jump by nearly 8 points—an event with a historical frequency of less than 3%—is a compelling reason to be more pessimistic. While I initially placed significant weight on the conflicting strong Conference Board consumer confidence report, I am now down-weighting it. The UMich index is more sensitive to inflation expectations, which Forecaster 2 rightly notes are elevated and sticky, and forward-looking economic sentiment, which my own research on the weak ADP report suggests is deteriorating. The arguments from Forecaster 3 regarding tariffs and Fed caution further solidify the rationale for a suppressed index reading. I am not lowering my forecast to 10% because there are still major economic data releases, including the official jobs report and a CPI report, before the final June sentiment number is calculated. Consumer sentiment can be volatile, and a surprisingly positive confluence of data could still plausibly produce the required rebound, but I now see this as a much less likely outcome.",
