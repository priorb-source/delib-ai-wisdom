  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (primary is June 24, 2025; credible calls likely within days to a week after RCV tabulation begins).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Cuomo wins the Democratic primary and is called the presumptive nominee after RCV.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Progressive turnout overperforms and non-Cuomo voters consolidate in later RCV rounds behind Zohran Mamdani (aided by AOC’s endorsement and late momentum), narrowly overtaking Cuomo.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds his ~40% first-choice lead and benefits from transfers from other moderates in RCV, crossing 50% by mid-to-late rounds and being called the presumptive nominee.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Multiple independent polls from March–May show Cuomo clearly ahead on first-choice preferences: SurveyUSA ~43–11 (Cuomo–Mamdani), Marist 37–18 with an RCV simulation putting Cuomo over 50% in round 5, and Emerson/PIX11/The Hill 39–23. Earlier Honan and Data for Progress polls also had Cuomo near 40% with double-digit leads. This cross-pollster, multi-month lead suggests a durable advantage driven by name recognition and a fragmented field. In RCV, if Cuomo is the lone major moderate and Mamdani is the consolidating progressive, transfers from other moderates are more likely to boost Cuomo late, consistent with the Marist simulation.\nTurnout/coalition: Cuomo’s endorsements in several Orthodox Jewish communities and targeted Hispanic outreach (including Spanish-language ads) support a coalition that tends to perform reliably in low-turnout municipal primaries. Mamdani’s AOC endorsement can energize progressive and youth turnout, but starting from the low-20s, he likely needs near-perfect consolidation of non-Cuomo preferences plus an enthusiasm surge to overcome Cuomo’s ~15–20 point first-choice gap.\nWhy not higher: NYC municipal polling can miss turnout composition; RCV dynamics are inherently uncertain; a late-breaking negative story or effective anti-Cuomo mobilization could compress the margin. AOC’s backing could catalyze left alignment in later rounds. Also, low-salience primaries can swing on small, organized blocs.\nWhy not lower: The lead is consistent across several reputable polls and time points, and at a magnitude that usually withstands ordinary late shifts. The available RCV modeling (Marist) explicitly shows Cuomo exceeding 50% in later rounds, a key check on the transfer risk.\nWhat would move me up: Fresh, high-quality polling within two weeks of the primary showing Cuomo ≥45% first-choice and/or clear RCV simulations favoring him; major union or cross-borough endorsements breaking for Cuomo; signs of moderate candidates’ voters ranking Cuomo second.\nWhat would move me down: A tightening to single digits in credible polls; visible consolidation of moderates behind a non-Cuomo alternative; major new scandal/negative revelations; evidence of outsized early vote/EDAY turnout from progressive strongholds; strong late organizational backing (e.g., key unions/Working Families Party) translating into field strength for Mamdani.",
