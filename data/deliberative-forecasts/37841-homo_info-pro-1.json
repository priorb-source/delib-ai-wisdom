    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was the most pessimistic of the group, driven heavily by the unprecedented nature of a performer facing a formal terrorism charge. The other two forecasters (at 35% and 40%) presented compelling reasoning that has caused me to reconsider the weight I assigned to certain factors. \n\nForecaster 2 rightly emphasized the specific mechanisms of pressure, such as the potential loss of the festival's operating license, which makes the threat from authorities much more tangible than just 'political pressure'. This reinforces the case for a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered: that Kneecap *has* successfully performed at other UK venues since the charges and controversies became public. This is a significant point, as it sets a precedent for promoters being willing to accept the risk and demonstrates that a cancellation is not a foregone conclusion. \n\nWhile both other forecasters placed more weight on Glastonbury's history of defiance than I did, I find the evidence of other recent UK gigs proceeding to be the most persuasive argument for increasing my forecast. It provides a concrete example that counteracts the assumption that any promoter would be 'compelled' to cancel.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 25% to 35%. My initial analysis was dominated by the severity of the Terrorism Act charge against a band member, which I still believe is the single most important factor making cancellation likely. The court hearing on June 18 remains a critical inflection point, and restrictive bail conditions or a remand in custody could make the decision for Glastonbury. Furthermore, as Forecaster 2 noted, the risk to the festival's license from police or local authorities presents a powerful lever to force a cancellation.\n\nHowever, the new information from Forecaster 3—that the band has continued to perform at other UK venues—is a material development that I had not factored in. This demonstrates that there is not a universal, de facto ban on the band by UK promoters. It provides Glastonbury's organizers with a precedent to point to if they choose to resist pressure and allow the performance to go ahead. \n\nTherefore, I am increasing my probability by 10 percentage points. The new forecast of 35% still reflects my belief that cancellation is the most probable outcome (a roughly 2 in 3 chance). The unique scale of Glastonbury means the security, political, and reputational risks are orders of magnitude higher than for a smaller club show, making it far more likely to yield to pressure. But the precedent set by other venues makes a 'Yes' outcome more plausible than I had initially judged.",
