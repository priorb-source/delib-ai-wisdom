    "review": "New and material: Forecaster 2 cites on-record White House confirmation of Trump’s attendance. That’s a strong update I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. They also flag the tail risk that the summit could be postponed out of June, which matters for resolution. Forecaster 3 adds useful detail on incentives (spending targets/Ukraine) that reinforces the attendance case but doesn’t materially move probability.\n\nConvincingness: The official confirmation plus the base-rate argument that reversals post-commitment are rare is compelling. The residual risks they list (health/domestic emergency/security threat/strategic reversal) are the right tails to retain.\n\nNet effect: I should update upward from my prior 82% given the official confirmation and short time to event, while keeping a non-trivial tail for unforeseen disruption or deliberate reversal, and the small chance of timing/postponement affecting June-specific resolution.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution: ~20 days (June 24–26).\nStatus quo: Official attendance confirmed; US presidents almost always attend NATO summits; Trump has attended previously despite tensions.\nNo scenarios: Last-minute cancellation due to domestic crisis (e.g., major emergency/government shutdown-level event), acute health issue, specific security threat to venue/travel, strategic boycott/reversal despite prior commitment, or summit postponement/cancellation shifting it out of June (fails resolution window).\nYes scenarios: Proceed with scheduled travel; even partial in-person presence at The Hague during June 24–26 satisfies criteria.\n\nWhy higher than before: On-record White House confirmation substantially reduces the probability of a discretionary no-show; reversals after such confirmation are rare. The calendar (G7 6/15–17, NATO 6/24–26) is workable, and incentives to attend are strong (public leverage on allies’ spending and Ukraine policy, headline value of in-person engagement).\nWhy not higher than ~90: Small but real tails remain for unforeseen crises, health/security issues, or a calculated last-minute snub; plus a low-probability risk of date shift out of June.\n\nWatch for: Final detailed schedule with pooled press, advance team lock-ins, and aircraft movement (would push closer to mid-90s). Any credible signals of delegation downgrade, health concerns, or domestic emergency (would lower odds).",
