  "information": "As of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days (until May 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy as of April 21, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues deliberating on whether to run and delays her announcement beyond May 1, either for strategic reasons or because she decides to wait and assess the field further. Alternatively, she may decide not to run for Senate at all despite her preparations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens makes her official announcement for US Senate in the next 10 days, capitalizing on the vacuum left by other top Democratic contenders withdrawing and leveraging her strong fundraising position and expanded campaign infrastructure.",
    "rationale": "The evidence from my research assistant strongly suggests Stevens is preparing for a Senate run: she raised $1.2M in Q1 2025, has $1.6M in her campaign fund, expanded her campaign staff, and is contacting potential replacements for her House seat. These are clear indicators of imminent Senate candidacy preparation. The CNN article context shows that top Democratic contenders have withdrawn, creating an opening that would make this an opportune time for Stevens to announce. However, the critical constraint is timing - with only 10 days remaining until May 1, the fact that she has NOT yet announced despite these preparations introduces significant uncertainty. Politicians often have strategic reasons for timing announcements, and she may choose to announce after May 1 rather than before. The base rate consideration favors the status quo (no announcement yet), but the strength of the preparatory signals is compelling. My forecast is not higher because she could easily delay by 2-3 weeks for strategic reasons, pushing past the May 1 deadline. It's not lower because all indicators point to an imminent Senate run, and 10 days provides sufficient time for an announcement. I would update higher if reports emerged of scheduled announcement events in the next week, or lower if reports suggested she's encountered complications or is reconsidering the race.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
