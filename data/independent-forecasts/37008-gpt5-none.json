    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until April 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the currently declared emergency (for the power crisis) was scheduled to run through April 29, 2025, and would lapse before April 30 unless extended or replaced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The March 31 energy emergency expires on April 29 and is not extended; no new emergency is declared for any other reason.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government extends the current energy state of emergency beyond April 29, or declares a new emergency (e.g., due to ongoing power issues or a separate hazard) that remains in force on April 30.",
    "rationale": "The only confirmed declaration we have is the March 31, 2025 emergency over power cuts, scheduled to end April 29. With 9 days left and no indications yet of an extension, the status quo points to No on April 30. Extensions are plausible—Samoa has previously extended emergencies month-to-month (e.g., during COVID), and infrastructure crises can take longer than a month to resolve—but absent evidence of ongoing severe outages or official signals about an extension, No should be favored.\n\nUpside risks to a Yes include: (1) continued significant power disruptions prompting an extension past April 29; (2) a separate emergency (e.g., late-season cyclone or other hazard). The latter seems low probability this far out with no current alerts; the former is the main driver but remains uncertain.\n\nWhy not higher: There is no current confirmation of extension, and the declared end date is April 29, which would leave April 30 outside the emergency. Why not lower: Utility and fuel supply issues can persist, and governments often extend emergencies close to expiry; even a brief extension would make April 30 a Yes.\n\nWhat would raise the forecast: credible reports of continued rolling blackouts, government statements indicating likely extension, or any new hazard prompting an emergency. What would lower it: reports that power supply has stabilized or official notice that the emergency will end on April 29 without extension.\n\nThe research assistant had no additional information, so this forecast leans on the announced end date and general patterns of emergency extensions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
