    "review": "My initial forecast of 10% was primarily based on the short timeline and the absence of public IPO preparation signals. The other two forecasters introduced critical new information and arguments that have significantly altered my perspective. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point about the upcoming Data + AI Summit in early June, which would create a communications quiet period, making a pre-summit announcement highly unlikely and compressing the viable timeline to a mere 2.5 weeks post-summit. More importantly, Forecaster 3 introduced a game-changing piece of evidence I had not considered: Databricks' massive $15.25 billion funding round in January 2025. This fact is the most persuasive argument presented in the deliberation. It fundamentally undercuts the thesis that Databricks has any financial urgency to go public soon, as it provides a long runway and has already addressed employee liquidity. Forecaster 3's reasoning that companies do not typically announce IPOs just months after such a large capital injection is extremely convincing. Combining the lack of urgency from the new funding with the tactical unlikelihood of an announcement around their major summit leads me to believe my initial forecast was far too high.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 10% to 4%. The new information about the January 2025 funding round, brought to my attention by Forecaster 3, is the primary driver of this change. A company that has just raised over $15 billion and provided employee liquidity has virtually no financial pressure to IPO in the immediate term. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of them rushing to make an announcement in what is, by all accounts, an uncertain market. My previous rationale relied on the idea that Databricks was 'IPO-ready' and might opportunistically jump into a market window. While they are still ready, their motivation to do so in the next five weeks is now close to zero.\n\nForecaster 2's point about the Data + AI Summit in early June further strengthens the case for 'No'. It makes an announcement in the first half of June tactically difficult and unwise, effectively shrinking the available window to the last ~2.5 weeks of the month. This short timeframe, combined with the lack of financial impetus, makes an announcement extremely improbable.\n\nI am not lowering my forecast to 3% because I still believe there is a tiny, non-zero chance of a purely strategic announcement. Databricks could theoretically decide to capitalize on the current AI investor enthusiasm by announcing a confidential filing, even without needing the capital, to signal market leadership. However, the overwhelming evidence—the recent funding, the CEO's historical caution, the tight timeline constrained by their summit, and the lack of preparatory signals—points strongly toward the status quo prevailing past the July 1 deadline.",
