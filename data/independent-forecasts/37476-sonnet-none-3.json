The company manages its cash flow adequately through the next two months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro faces an acute liquidity crisis - perhaps missing a critical debt payment, exhausting cash reserves, losing access to credit lines, or facing vendor/creditor pressure that forces management to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure obligations or Chapter 7 for liquidation.",
    "rationale": "With only 53 days remaining until the resolution date, this is an extremely short forecasting window. The base rate for bankruptcy filings is quite low - most companies, even struggling ones, do not file for bankruptcy in any given two-month period. Status quo bias strongly favors no bankruptcy filing.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **Base rate**: Corporate bankruptcies, especially for publicly-traded companies, are relatively rare events requiring severe financial distress.\n\n2. **Recent reporting**: The reference to Q4 2024 results suggests GoPro is still operating and filing required SEC disclosures normally, which companies in immediate danger of bankruptcy often struggle to do.\n\n3. **Information vacuum**: The research assistant found no additional information, which suggests there are no recent news reports of imminent distress, missed payments, going concern warnings, or other bankruptcy signals.\n\n4. **Time constraints**: Even if GoPro were experiencing financial difficulties, companies typically explore alternatives before bankruptcy (refinancing, asset sales, investor injections).\n\n5. **Historical context**: While GoPro has faced business challenges and competition in recent years, there's a difference between struggling profitability and imminent bankruptcy.\n\nWhy not lower: I cannot access the actual Q4 2024 financial results, so I cannot verify the company's current cash position, debt levels, or liquidity ratios. Some probability must be reserved for unknown financial stress.\n\nWhy not higher: Absent any signals of distress, the extremely short time frame, and the low base rate for bankruptcy all argue against a higher probability. Bankruptcy typically doesn't come as a complete surprise within a 2-month window.\n\nTo update higher: News of missed debt payments, going concern warnings, credit facility terminations, or reports of bankruptcy advisors being hired. To update lower: Strong Q4 results showing healthy cash position and liquidity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
