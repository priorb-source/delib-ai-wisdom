    "review": "Both analyses are consistent with my priors: small, Class II, perishable product with limited distribution suggests closure is likely eventually, but the remaining window to June 1 and current Active status create meaningful inertia toward No. Forecaster 2 places more weight on administrative lag and the short time left, which is a useful corrective against overconfidence. Forecaster 3 mirrors my base-rate view and timing window. Neither adds new factual information, but the emphasis on the narrow remaining window and FSIS closeout cadence strengthens the case for trimming a slightly-Yes lean downward.",
    "rationale": "Key facts unchanged: ~303 lbs, Washington-only vending machines, best-by late Feb, no illnesses, Active as of May 8. FSIS typically closes these after effectiveness checks and corrective-action verification; small Class II, limited scope recalls often close within 1–4 months, but closures sometimes lag administratively. With ~23 days left, the hazard of a May closure is real—there are multiple weekly update opportunities—but the status quo being Active now suggests a nontrivial chance of slipping into June. I initially leaned slightly Yes at 57% based on scope and perishability. In light of the deliberators’ emphasis on time remaining and bureaucratic friction (and absent any sign of recent progress), I’m shading down modestly while staying above 50% due to the tiny scope, expired product, and straightforward fix. If still Active by roughly May 24, I would update down sharply (to ~30–35%) given dwindling runway.",
