  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Mozambique maintains its current Level 3 'Reconsider Travel' advisory without escalation to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Mozambique remains contained to specific northern regions (Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces), with the State Department continuing to use regional warnings rather than a country-wide Level 4 advisory. Post-election protests gradually subside, and the capital Maputo remains relatively stable. The jihadist insurgency doesn't spread to central or southern regions, and no major attacks occur that would threaten broader American interests or the diplomatic presence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid deterioration occurs where either the jihadist insurgency spreads significantly beyond northern provinces or post-election violence escalates into widespread civil unrest affecting major cities including Maputo. This could involve a major terrorist attack in urban centers, complete breakdown of government control, threats to the U.S. Embassy, or a combination of security factors creating unsafe conditions throughout the country that meet the threshold for Level 4 designation.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Level 4 advisories are rare (only 21 countries currently have them) and reserved for extreme situations like active war zones, complete governmental collapse, or uncontrolled widespread violence. Mozambique's current Level 3 status, last updated December 19, 2023, hasn't been changed despite recent concerning developments, suggesting the State Department doesn't view the situation as approaching Level 4 criteria. The State Department already employs regional warnings for dangerous areas like Cabo Delgado and Niassa, which allows targeted warnings without country-wide escalation. While the recent jihadist attacks in late April/early May 2025 and ongoing post-election protests are concerning, these don't yet constitute the widespread national emergency typical of Level 4 countries. The capital appears relatively stable, and the violence remains geographically contained. Foreign precedent shows that South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 in March 2025, demonstrating the State Department does make upgrades, but that case involved more severe nationwide instability. For my forecast to be higher, I'd need evidence of: violence spreading to major population centers, imminent threat to diplomatic facilities, or complete breakdown of national infrastructure. For it to be lower, I'd need more historical data showing even fewer transitions from Level 3 to Level 4, though the rarity of Level 4 advisories already provides strong evidence. With 2 months remaining, rapid deterioration is possible but not the most likely scenario given the status quo's persistence and the high bar for Level 4 designation.",
