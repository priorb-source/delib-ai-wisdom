    "review": "Forecaster 2 largely mirrors my baseline: strong strategic incentives, feasible logistics, and inherent wartime uncertainty limiting a very high forecast. Forecaster 3 adds the key new piece: a public, on‑record commitment by Zelenskyy on May 27 (“I will be”) plus host‑nation security planning reportedly tailored to his presence. That materially increases the likelihood beyond my prior. While I’d like to verify the exact quote and the specificity of the security measures, such signals—especially a public commitment—tend to be reliable this close to the event. I agree with Forecaster 3’s direction but find 95% a bit high given residual wartime and travel risks that have caused last‑minute changes before.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The base case already favored attendance (clear invitation, very high strategic value with G7 on Ukraine aid/sanctions, securable venue, and a workable travel schedule between Europe and Canada ahead of the June 24–25 NATO summit). The new information that Zelenskyy publicly confirmed he will attend, combined with indications of Canadian planning anticipating him, substantially reduces uncertainty from “intent” and “logistics.” Remaining downside risks are primarily exogenous: a sudden battlefield crisis in Ukraine, acute security threats, or unforeseen operational/aircraft issues prompting a last‑minute switch to virtual or cancellation. Given timing (~1–2 weeks out) and his current active travel, those risks persist but are low. Net effect: I move up meaningfully from 72% while stopping short of mid‑90s due to irreducible wartime tail risks. I would move higher on confirmed travel/arrival or official schedules from either government; I would drop on credible reports of a major escalation in Ukraine or official guidance that he’ll participate virtually instead.",
