  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to watch the field, focuses on launching his new party, and repeats past cycles by teasing a run without declaring before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan pairs the public launch of his new party with a surprise gubernatorial announcement in June, or reacts to recent candidate entries (e.g., Jolly, Donalds) with a swift declaration to shape the field and fundraising.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: As of June 6, there has been no announcement. Morgan told Politico in mid-May he would observe the field before deciding and that, if he ran, he’d favor a short (~3-month) campaign—suggesting a much later start closer to 2026, not an early 2025 declaration. Historically, he has publicly mulled runs (2018, 2022) but ultimately declined. With only ~24 days left and no hard deadline forcing a June decision, the status quo points to No.  \n- New party factor: Reports in Feb/May say he’s been working to launch a centrist party (variously dubbed Capitalist Party/#ForThePeople). While this creates a conceivable trigger for an announcement (tying a candidacy to the party’s launch), party formation logistics and his stated wait-and-see approach reduce the odds of a sudden June declaration.  \n- Field developments: David Jolly joined the Democratic race (June 5), Jason Pizzo plans an independent run, Byron Donalds is in on the GOP side, and Casey DeSantis is considering. This mixed, fluid field gives Morgan reason to keep waiting rather than rush—consistent with his stated posture.  \nWhy not higher: No imminent filing deadlines, his pattern of reluctance, and the three‑month campaign concept all argue against a June 2025 announcement.  \nWhy not lower: He is wealthy, media-savvy, and could choose to capitalize on a party launch moment or a news-cycle opportunity with a surprise declaration. Also, the independent/centrist lane remains open enough that a June move is not impossible.  \nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a scheduled launch event, leaks from his team hinting at a gubernatorial bid tied to the party rollout, ad buys, or explicit social media teases with dates.  \nWhat would move me down: A public statement reiterating he won’t decide until later in 2025/2026, or a party launch with no candidacy announcement and messaging that decisions will come much later.",
