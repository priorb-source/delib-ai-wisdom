    "review": "The other two forecasters provide sound analyses that are in strong agreement with my own. We all correctly identify the extremely short timeframe (~6 weeks) and the low base rate of zoonotic spillover leading to a detected human case as the primary drivers for a low forecast. Forecaster 2 adds a useful specific scenario of a lab accident or field researcher infection, which is a plausible, albeit low-probability, pathway for rapid detection. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent and critical point that I had not fully weighed: the non-primary nature of the source article reporting the virus's discovery. This introduces uncertainty about the significance and even the validity of the discovery itself, which further diminishes the likelihood of it being on the radar for global public health surveillance. Their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces the consensus conclusion.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast of 1%. The deliberation with the other experts has strongly reinforced my initial assessment. Their arguments, especially Forecaster 3's point about the questionable quality of the source material, strengthen the case for a 'No' resolution. If a novel virus is not well-documented in credible scientific literature or being tracked by major health organizations, the probability that a new human case would be correctly identified and attributed to it within six weeks is minuscule. However, I am maintaining my 1% forecast rather than lowering it further, as it serves as a robust estimate for an event that is extremely unlikely but not impossible. This value accounts for the small, stochastic probabilities of a spillover event occurring in a highly sensitive surveillance area, a lab-related incident as mentioned by Forecaster 2, or the discovery being more significant than the single source suggests. The core logic remains unchanged: the concatenation of low-probability events required to resolve 'Yes' within the short deadline makes the status quo overwhelmingly likely.",
