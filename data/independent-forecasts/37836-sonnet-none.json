    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The number of direct flight destinations from Erbil remains close to current levels, which are likely near the 31 threshold given how the question is framed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erbil maintains 31 or fewer direct destinations through July 1st. Seasonal route additions fail to materialize, or any new routes are offset by discontinued service. The optimistic tourism projections don't translate into expanded airline service, or new routes are added after July 1st",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer tourism season brings 1-3 additional direct flight destinations that push the total above 31. The 'promising season' mentioned in the article materializes with airlines adding seasonal routes to meet increased travel demand. Existing carriers expand their networks to include Erbil",
    "rationale": "The key challenge is that I lack baseline data on current direct destinations from Erbil. The threshold of 31 destinations suggests this is near current or expected levels - questions typically set thresholds that create meaningful uncertainty. With only 39 days until resolution, major changes are unlikely since airlines typically finalize summer schedules months in advance. Any seasonal routes for summer 2025 would already be scheduled by late May. The Shafaq News article headline suggests optimism about Kurdistan's summer season, which could indicate planned tourism growth and potentially new routes. However, optimistic headlines don't always translate to concrete operational changes. Regional factors affecting Erbil include Iraqi Kurdistan's political stability, economic conditions, oil revenues, and regional tensions. The status quo bias strongly applies here - aviation networks change gradually, and 5-6 weeks is insufficient time for substantial route expansion. If Erbil currently has 29-30 destinations, seasonal additions might push it over 31. If it has 32-33, it would stay above. If it has 25-28, reaching 32+ would require unlikely rapid growth. My forecast is not higher because: (1) very limited time for changes, (2) summer routes would already be scheduled, (3) no specific evidence of imminent route additions. My forecast is not lower because: (1) summer seasonal effect could add 1-2 routes, (2) the optimistic article suggests some growth potential, (3) uncertainty about baseline cuts both ways. To update higher, I'd need: evidence Erbil currently has 30-31 destinations with seasonal routes announced, or confirmation of multiple new route launches. To update lower, I'd need: evidence of current destinations well below 31 with no new announcements, or regional disruptions affecting aviation",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
