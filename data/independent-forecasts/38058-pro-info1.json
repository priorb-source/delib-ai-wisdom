  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question will be resolved by July 1, 2025, based on front pages published between May 20 and June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The word 'tariff' continues to be a prominent topic in economic and political news, ensuring its appearance on the front page of at least one, if not both, of the newspapers each day. This would result in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing US-EU trade negotiations, with the new tariff deadline of July 9, generate constant front-page news. Daily updates, political statements, or market analysis keep the word 'tariff' in the headlines or summary sections (like WSJ's 'What's News') of at least one of the papers every single day during the resolution period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major, non-economic breaking news event, such as a large-scale natural disaster or a significant international incident unrelated to trade, completely dominates the news cycle for a full 24 hours. On that day, both newspapers dedicate their entire front page to this event, causing the word 'tariff' to be omitted from both publications simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on the status quo, which is an active and high-profile trade dispute between the US and the EU. The key piece of information from my research assistant is that President Trump has postponed EU tariffs until July 9, 2025. This sets a 'ticking clock' that ensures the topic will remain newsworthy throughout the entire resolution period (late May through June). Given that the resolution criteria are very broad—the word 'tariff' can appear anywhere on the front page, including in small summary sections—it is highly probable that at least one of these two major newspapers will mention it daily. The Wall Street Journal, in particular, is likely to carry a mention in its 'What's News' section consistently. Therefore, the probability of the word disappearing from *both* papers on the same day is low.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because the resolution period spans over 40 days. This provides numerous opportunities for an unforeseen, major news story to break and dominate a 24-hour news cycle, which is all that is required for a 'Yes' resolution. News is volatile, and a single quiet day, perhaps on a weekend, could satisfy the criteria.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the tariff story is not a minor issue; it is a central policy of the current administration involving major global economies. It is unlikely to vanish completely from the front pages of the nation's two most important newspapers, even for a single day, while active negotiations and a looming deadline are in play. For me to increase my forecast, the US and EU would need to reach a surprise comprehensive deal, effectively ending the news story.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nU.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
