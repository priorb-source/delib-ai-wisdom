    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my view: short horizon, statutory program stability, and long-lived State Department URLs make persistence highly likely. The most useful additional point is that the resolution’s “on or after July 1” phrasing reduces concern about a momentary outage on exactly July 1. They also frame the main residual risk as a CMS/URL restructure or a hard redirect that Metaculus might not count as “at this location,” which matches my concerns. No new concrete evidence was introduced, but their emphasis on the reduced impact of transient downtime marginally strengthens the case for a higher probability.",
    "rationale": "The DV program’s existence is unlikely to change within six weeks, and travel.state.gov tends to keep key program pages stable year-round. The main failure mode is not policy but a technical/content reorganization that alters the specific slug “diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html” or replaces the step-by-step instructions with a generic notice. Because the criterion allows access “on or after” July 1, transient downtime risk is de minimis. I initially set 90% accounting for URL/redirect ambiguity and small CMS-migration risk. Given peers’ reasoning—especially the reduced weight on outage risk—and the very short horizon, I’m nudging up to 93%. Residual downside remains from a strict interpretation of “at this location” if there’s a redirect or a renamed path, or if Step 1 instructions are consolidated elsewhere before July 1.",
