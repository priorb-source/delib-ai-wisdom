    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key factor I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: Canadian inadmissibility for foreign nationals with certain criminal convictions, implying Trump would likely need a Temporary Resident Permit or ministerial exemption. That’s a real gating risk, especially if the trip is purely for leisure. With only ~12 days left and no signals of such paperwork or coordination, this meaningfully lowers odds. Their emphasis on status quo and lack of advance buzz also aligns with my view. Forecaster 3’s “no mega-headliner” point is reasonable but secondary; the bigger drivers are international/official travel logistics and immigration/security coordination. I also think, as a sitting president, any Canada trip would almost certainly be official and publicly signaled ahead of time—another strong negative signal at this lead time. Overall, Forecaster 2 introduced the most important new downside argument; both are directionally consistent with my prior reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I previously had 7%. Incorporating the Canadian admissibility hurdle plus the reality that a presidential foreign visit would almost certainly be official and pre-announced, the absence of any credible signals 12 days out is strongly dispositive toward No. Add in: (1) Trump just attended a UFC event in April (historically rare to do back-to-back numbered cards in ~4 weeks), (2) no precedent of him attending UFC abroad, (3) increased security/logistics for a foreign appearance, and (4) marginally lower draw with Rogan not attending. Upside pathways exist (a last-minute TRP/waiver, an official visit scheduled to Montreal that weekend, explicit hints from Dana White/UFC), but none are in evidence. I’m nudging down to reflect the added immigration/official-visit friction while keeping a small tail for a surprise arrangement.",
