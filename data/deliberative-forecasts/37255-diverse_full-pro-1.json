    "review": "All three forecasters agree that a 'No' outcome is highly likely due to the extremely short two-month timeframe and the complexities of Libya's political situation. My initial analysis was strongly aligned with Forecaster 2, who reinforced the 'No' case by emphasizing Libya's institutional fragmentation as a major barrier to any rapid policy implementation. The most impactful new argument came from Forecaster 3, who introduced a plausible scenario for 'Yes' that I had not considered: the possibility of an executive-led ratification by the Government of National Unity (GNU) that bypasses the contentious and slow-moving House of Representatives (HoR). Forecaster 3 rightly points out that the African Union might accept such a deposit to maintain momentum, even if its domestic legitimacy is contested. Both forecasters also correctly noted that while Libya's stated goal of being a trade gateway to Africa is consistent with AfCFTA, this strategic interest has not yet translated into concrete action.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast. My initial reasoning, which placed heavy weight on the short deadline, Libya's stated focus on a bilateral deal with Turkey, and the lack of any public signals of progress, remains the core of my analysis. The arguments from the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2's points on deep political fragmentation, have reinforced my view that a conventional, legislative ratification process is nearly impossible before July 1. However, Forecaster 3's analysis introduced a key consideration I had overlooked: the potential for a non-legislative, executive-led ratification. In Libya's unique political context, the GNU might see a fast-tracked ratification as a diplomatic win and attempt to deposit the instrument without full legislative approval. This represents a plausible, low-probability path to a 'Yes' outcome. To account for this specific scenario, I am updating my forecast upward from 5% to 9%. This remains a low probability but better reflects the possibility of an unconventional fast-track action.",
