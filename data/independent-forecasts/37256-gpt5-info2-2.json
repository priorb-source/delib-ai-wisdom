  "information": "The government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent a new political push, the legislature is unlikely to table, pass, and deposit ratification in time",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TNLA does not place AfCFTA on its order paper in May–June, or it meets too infrequently to pass the ratification. Even if passed late, the government fails to promptly deposit the instrument with the AU before July 1 amid fiscal and political turmoil.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The presidency/cabinet prioritizes AfCFTA as a quick-win reform, calls a special sitting, and the TNLA fast-tracks a short ratification bill in May/June. The president signs swiftly and the Foreign Affairs Ministry deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the baseline is “no change.” South Sudan has not yet ratified AfCFTA, and the TNLA has been meeting rarely (only 32 sitting days in H2 2024 per the assistant). The published May–June calendar lists no trade bills, and the Finance Ministry reportedly has not budgeted for AfCFTA-related obligations (e.g., tariff phase-down), signaling low readiness. The political environment is adverse: a severe fiscal crunch from disrupted oil flows, a delayed peace roadmap, preparations for December 2025 elections, and late-April arrests of senior officials including a vice-president. These factors typically crowd out discretionary trade legislation and slow inter-ministerial coordination required to ratify and deposit instruments. Countervailing considerations keep the probability above zero: ratification can be procedurally simple if politically prioritized; African parliaments have occasionally fast-tracked treaty ratifications within weeks; and the government might seek a low-cost signal to investors and regional partners. A cabinet communiqué placing AfCFTA on the agenda, TNLA order papers scheduling the bill, or public statements from Trade/Foreign Affairs or the AfCFTA Secretariat about imminent ratification would move this forecast up. Conversely, further security disruptions, session suspensions, or continued absence of AfCFTA on the legislative agenda would push it down. Weighing the strong status quo inertia and institutional constraints against a small but real chance of a last-minute push, the odds appear low but non-zero.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
