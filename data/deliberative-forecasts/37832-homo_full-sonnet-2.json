    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that closely align with my initial analysis but emphasize certain points more strongly. Forecaster 3's observation that 'if they planned to announce at the June summit, we would likely see preparatory signals by now' is particularly persuasive. We're now less than 3 weeks from the June 9-12 summit, and the complete absence of any leaks, rumors, or preparation signals is a stronger negative indicator than I initially weighted. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize that the employee liquidity provision in the funding round addresses a key driver for going public, further reducing pressure. Their forecasts of 10-15% suggest I may have been slightly too optimistic at 18%. However, I note that all three of us agree on the core analysis: status quo favors No, recent funding eliminates urgency, no visible preparation, very short timeframe, but the June summit creates a small window of possibility for an announcement.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I should adjust my forecast downward modestly. The other forecasters' emphasis on timing is well-founded: if Databricks intended to announce IPO plans at the June 9-12 summit (the only realistic window in the remaining 40 days), we would expect to see some preparation signals, leaks, or market chatter by May 22. The absence of any such signals this close to the event is more damaging to the Yes case than I initially weighted. Additionally, the point about employee liquidity already being addressed in the funding round strengthens the case that management feels no urgency. However, I don't believe I should go as low as 10% because: (1) the question only asks about announcing plans, not executing an IPO, which is theoretically a lower bar; (2) surprise corporate announcements, while rare, do occur; (3) the June summit with multiple Fortune 500 CEOs remains a plausible high-profile venue; and (4) the CEO has not explicitly ruled out 2025. The complete consensus among all three forecasters on the key factors (recent funding, no signals, short timeframe, June summit as catalyst) increases my confidence in the overall framework, but the reasonable range of 10-18% suggests inherent uncertainty about how to weight the June summit possibility against the absence of preparation signals.",
