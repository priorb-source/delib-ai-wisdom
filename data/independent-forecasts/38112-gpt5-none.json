    "status_quo_outcome": "No new full‑membership invitation is issued before or during the 17th BRICS Summit; expansion is deferred to a later date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil, India, and others cannot reach consensus on further enlargement amid a desire to consolidate the 2023–25 changes (including Indonesia’s recent accession). With unanimity required and some partner countries still not having confirmed partner participation, members prioritize institutional agenda items and postpone new full-member invitations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sherpa-level talks converge on one upgrade from the 2024 partner list and leaders announce at Rio an invitation for a not-previously-invited country (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Belarus, or another partner) to become a full member, reflecting a China/Russia push for momentum and acquiescence by Brazil and India to a limited, balanced addition.",
    "rationale": "Baseline pressures favor caution. After the major 2023 expansion and the introduction of a partner framework in 2024, BRICS appears to be pacing growth. Indonesia’s upgrade to full membership in January 2025 demonstrates that upgrades are possible between summits, but also suggests members may wish to ‘digest’ recent changes. Unanimity is a high bar, and India has historically been the most cautious on rapid expansion; Brazil as host is likely to avoid divisive moves. Some 2024 partner states (e.g., Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) have not even confirmed partner participation, which weakens the case for announcing further full-member invitations now. With about five weeks left, we would typically expect credible leaks if a major invite were imminent; absent such signals (the research assistant provided no additional information), the status quo of no new invite is the default. Why not higher: strong internal incentives to consolidate; unanimity hurdle; host’s likely caution; lack of public signaling. Why not lower: expansion remains a stated goal, China/Russia favor it, and the partner track provides ready candidates—so a limited, consensus pick is still plausible. What would move me up: authoritative reporting that Brazilian and Indian sherpas have converged on one candidate; public statements by Brazil or India welcoming a specific country; that country’s leader signaling readiness and agenda coordination for Rio; draft communiqués or agenda leaks mentioning expansion. What would move me down: explicit statements by Brazil/India that no expansion decisions will be taken in Rio; renewed friction over Saudi Arabia’s status; indications that unresolved governance or bank issues will dominate the summit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
