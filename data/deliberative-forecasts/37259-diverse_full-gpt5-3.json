    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core blockers I identified: a freshly elected gradualist government, multi‑year commission timeline, heavy economic dependence, and very short time left. Forecaster 3 helpfully emphasizes that only announcing a date (even far in the future) would satisfy resolution, which is the main upside path. Forecaster 2 stresses that such an announcement would contradict the governing mandate, which raises the bar further. Neither adds concrete signs of imminent legislative or executive steps, and neither shows that the PM or cabinet can unilaterally and validly “schedule” an independence referendum without parliamentary action—if a formal act is required, that further lowers odds within the window. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and nudges me slightly downward from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "The dominant scenario remains No: the Demokraatit‑led government campaigned on gradualism and has prioritized economic self‑sufficiency first; a commission with a multi‑year brief is already in place; past referendums had long lead times; and the parliamentary and administrative steps to validly schedule an independence referendum likely can’t be compressed into <60 days absent a deliberate push, which there’s no evidence of. The main Yes path is a political compromise to announce a distant date to placate pro‑independence forces (e.g., Naleraq pressure, elevated public salience). However, committing to a date would constrain the government’s negotiating and policy flexibility and appears at odds with their platform, making it unlikely now. Given these considerations and the short fuse, I’m trimming my estimate slightly to reflect the procedural and political hurdles highlighted by the other forecasters while retaining a small tail for an announced far‑future date. I’m moving from 10% to 7%.",
