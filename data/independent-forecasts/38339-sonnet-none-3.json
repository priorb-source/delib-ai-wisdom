    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24-25 days remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The agreement remains in force without cancellation, resulting in a No outcome. International energy transmission agreements typically persist absent extraordinary circumstances.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite financial pressures and high-level political discussions, Bulgaria and Turkey continue negotiations or delay decisive action. The parties may pursue renegotiation of terms rather than outright cancellation, or simply continue under existing arrangements past the deadline. Complex international commercial agreements, especially in energy, rarely see abrupt termination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Bulgargaz or BOTAS formally announces cancellation of the transmission agreement within the next 24 days. This could occur if Bulgaria's financial crisis with BOTAS debts reaches a breaking point, forcing unilateral action, or if ongoing negotiations between Borissov and Erdogan result in mutual agreement to terminate. The announcement criteria is broad - even if one side announces termination and the other denies it, this would count as Yes.",
    "rationale": "The background indicates genuine tensions: Bulgargaz is reportedly near bankruptcy due to debts to BOTAS, and Bulgarian PM Borissov has directly engaged Erdogan requesting exit from the agreement. These are significant warning signs of contractual stress. However, several factors suggest lower probability: (1) Only 24-25 days remain - an extremely short window for formal cancellation of a major international energy agreement; (2) No research assistant information indicates imminent announcement or recent developments; (3) International commercial agreements, particularly in strategic energy sectors, involve complex legal and diplomatic processes that rarely conclude quickly; (4) Both parties likely prefer renegotiation over cancellation given geopolitical and economic interdependencies. The status quo strongly favors agreement continuation - institutions change slowly, and we lack concrete evidence of imminent action despite known pressures. My forecast isn't higher because we have no recent evidence of impending announcement and the timeframe is very constrained. It isn't lower because the financial pressures are real, high-level political engagement has occurred, and the resolution criteria allows either party to announce (providing two potential paths). I would revise upward with news of: active negotiation breakthroughs, official statements indicating imminent decision, or escalating crisis rhetoric. I would revise downward if the parties announce extended negotiations or temporary arrangements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
