    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the tiny 0.4 pp gap and the NBU’s guidance that inflation peaks in Q2, which I already weighted, but they sharpen the case by stressing that even a moderate April m/m could be sufficient. However, neither explicitly quantifies the April base effect (April 2024 m/m), which is crucial because ΔYoY ≈ m/m(Apr 2025) − m/m(Apr 2024). Forecaster 2’s 85% feels overconfident given the potential for a post-March payback and base-effect uncertainty. Forecaster 3’s 72% is closer to my prior and better reflects timing risk (peak could be May/June) and monthly volatility. Net-new helpful angle: reiteration that Easter timing (in April 2025 vs May 2024) likely makes April 2024 m/m relatively low, raising odds this April clears 15%.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: Jan–Mar 2025 YoY CPI rose 12.9% → 13.4% → 14.6%, with March m/m 1.5%. NBU signals a Q2 peak and maintained a tight 15.5% rate. War-related supply/energy shocks persist; Easter basket +18–19% y/y suggests acute food pressure in April. The decision hinges on the base: to lift YoY by 0.4 pp, April 2025 m/m must exceed April 2024 m/m by ~0.4 pp. With Orthodox Easter 2024 in May, April 2024 m/m was likely modest (~0.2–0.3%). That implies we need roughly 0.6–0.7% m/m in April 2025 to reach ≥15.0%. After a very hot March (1.5% m/m), a deceleration is likely, but 0.6% m/m remains plausible given ongoing energy disruptions, food pressures, and seasonal clothing/footwear effects. Risks to a ‘No’: a pronounced payback from March’s spike (e.g., 0.2–0.4% m/m), stabilization in fuel and the hryvnia, or early seasonal produce easing. Risks to a ‘Yes’: continued supply-side constraints, further energy system strain, and Easter-timed food price increases. Considering the small remaining gap, likely low April 2024 base, and NBU’s Q2-peak guidance, I edge up slightly from my prior but stay shy of the high-70s/80s due to plausible monthly volatility and timing risk that the peak is May. Update: Increase from 68% to 73%.",
