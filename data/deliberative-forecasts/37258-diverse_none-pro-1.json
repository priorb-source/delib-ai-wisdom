    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key fundamentals: the short timeframe and the high constitutional and political barriers make a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable. All three of us place the probability below 10%. Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns closely with my initial assessment. Forecaster 3, however, introduced several crucial and highly plausible contextual details about the political landscape in May 2025 that I had not fully specified. Their points about a likely SNP minority government, a weakened mandate following a 2024 general election, and First Minister John Swinney's cautious leadership style were particularly persuasive. These factors provide a compelling argument for why the Scottish government's appetite for a high-risk, symbolic gesture would be even lower than I initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the powerful status quo inhibitors (the UK Supreme Court ruling, UK government opposition) but allowed for a small chance of a symbolic political gesture, given the resolution criteria do not require UK legality. After reviewing the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. The key driver for this change is the specific and convincing political context provided by Forecaster 3. A weakened, minority SNP government in the wake of a difficult 2024 general election would almost certainly be focused on rebuilding support and demonstrating governing competence, not engaging in what would be widely seen as a politically impotent and potentially counter-productive stunt. The strategic incentive to announce a referendum date they cannot deliver, which was already weak in my original analysis, becomes almost non-existent in this more detailed and probable scenario. This new information convinces me that the likelihood of such an announcement is lower than I first thought. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 5% to 3%.",
