    "review": "The other forecasters raise important concerns I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 highlights the distinction between authorized commemorative events versus protests - a critical categorization issue for the Global Protest Tracker. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the 'double hurdle' problem: large protests must both occur AND be documented by the Tracker. However, I notice a significant discrepancy: my research assistant explicitly reported massive March protests with 'hundreds of thousands' participants and CHP claiming over 2 million on March 29, with nearly 1,900 detentions by late March. Neither Forecaster 2 nor 3 mentions these March events - they focus on May 1 Labor Day events and Saraçhane protests with only 14 arrests. This raises three possibilities: (1) our research assistants provided different information, (2) the March protests I was told about haven't been widely documented yet, or (3) there's confusion about event details. Forecaster 3's pessimism about government suppression is valid, but seems to contradict the scale of arrests and protests my assistant reported. If the March 29 protest had even a fraction of the claimed 2 million participants, it would vastly exceed the 10,000 threshold. The key uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker will capture these events, not whether they occurred.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm revising my forecast downward but remaining considerably above the other forecasters. My research assistant provided specific, detailed information about massive March protests that would easily exceed 10,000 participants if accurate. The scale of government response (1,900 detentions), Wikipedia documentation, and CHP's claims all suggest significant events occurred. However, the other forecasters' analyses introduce important uncertainties: (1) The Global Protest Tracker may have specific categorization criteria that could exclude certain events; (2) Database updates may lag significantly; (3) There's genuine uncertainty about whether the March events I was told about are as documented as suggested. The 'double hurdle' point is valid - events must both occur at scale AND be captured by the Tracker. With 55 days remaining, there's reasonable time for database updates if the March events occurred as reported, or for additional large protests to materialize. I'm updating from 78% to 60% to account for: documentation uncertainty, potential categorization issues, and the possibility that my information about March protests is incomplete or inaccurate. However, I'm maintaining a substantially higher forecast than Forecaster 3 (23%) because the specific evidence my assistant provided suggests large-scale protest activity has occurred, making documentation more likely than not.",
