    "no_outcome_scenario": "USDA revises the webpage language before July 1 to remove the exact phrase “snack foods” (e.g., replacing it with “snacks” or dropping the example list entirely), or updates the page to signal an impending policy shift and omits the phrase.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No substantive update to the page occurs before July 1, or any refresh retains the exact phrase “snack foods.”",
    "rationale": "As of May 5, 2025, the USDA page explicitly includes “snack foods,” and federal policy on SNAP-eligible items typically changes slowly and via formal rulemaking or legislation. Even with recent political rhetoric about restricting “bad food and sugary drinks,” implementing actual eligibility changes would take longer than the ~6 weeks remaining. The more realistic near-term path to a No is a communications choice: removing or rewording the example list to avoid the appearance of endorsing junk food. That is operationally easy and could happen without policy change. However, this phrasing has been stable for years across USDA materials, and agencies are generally conservative about altering canonical eligibility pages without a policy driver. Weighing inertia heavily points to Yes. Why not higher? Because the question hinges on the exact phrase “snack foods”; a minor editorial change (e.g., switching to “snacks”) would flip this to No. Also, political pressure increases the chance of a messaging tweak before any formal rulemaking. Why not lower? There is limited time, no reported concrete steps to change eligibility language on the site as of May 20, and prior patterns favor stability. What would move me up? Signals that USDA is keeping existing messaging, a site freeze, or explicit comms reaffirming current language. What would move me down? Any USDA web update or press guidance about rewording SNAP purchase descriptions, a visible content refresh on the FNS site, or leaked drafts showing a shift from “snack foods” to alternative phrasing. Research assistant provided no additional info beyond the current state noted in the prompt.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
