    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement, placing the probability of Sheikh Hasina's return before July 1, 2025, in a low range (8%-15%). We all identify the same core factors driving this assessment: the extremely short timeframe, the slow and politically sensitive nature of extradition (especially involving a friendly former leader), India's lack of action on the December 2024 request, and the severe legal jeopardy (crimes against humanity charges) Hasina would face upon return, making a voluntary move highly irrational. Forecaster 2's emphasis on India's historical ties with Hasina and the unlikelihood of a rapid reversal of its de facto asylum policy was a particularly strong argument that reinforces the improbability of a forced return. Forecaster 3's point about a potential 'symbolic' return is a valid, though low-probability, consideration for a voluntary move. The consensus is that the status quo is overwhelmingly powerful here, and the barriers to her return in the next seven weeks are immense.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am adjusting my probability slightly downwards from 12% to 9%. My initial reasoning remains largely the same, but the deliberation has helped me refine the weights I assign to different factors. Forecaster 2's analysis convinced me that I was likely underestimating the inertia in India's foreign policy. The chance of India extraditing Hasina, a long-term ally, in such a short window is vanishingly small. Therefore, the event's probability rests almost entirely on a voluntary return. While Hasina has vowed to return, and the return of her rival Khaleda Zia might create political pressure, these factors seem insufficient to compel her to face near-certain arrest and trial for crimes against humanity. A voluntary return would be a high-risk political gambit with a low chance of success. Forecaster 3's analysis rightly points out that such unpredictable political moves are not impossible, which is why the probability is not closer to zero. However, the combined force of the arguments against a return in this tight timeframe is overwhelming. My updated forecast of 9% reflects a position that is slightly more bearish than my initial 12%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 2's assessment of the formidable diplomatic and legal barriers, while still acknowledging the small, non-zero chance of a politically motivated, high-stakes decision by Hasina herself.",
