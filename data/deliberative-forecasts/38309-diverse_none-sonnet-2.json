    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 present diametrically opposed interpretations. Forecaster 2 (95%) interprets the absence of information about opponents as strong evidence Jones has cleared the field, emphasizing that two weeks before a primary, serious challengers would be known. Forecaster 3 (40%) assumes meaningful competition exists and focuses on structural factors—NOVA's dominance in Democratic primaries, prosecutor advantages for AG races, and Jones's 2021 loss—to conclude Jones faces headwinds. Both raise valid points I hadn't fully considered: the significance of the late timeline and the historical context of Jones's previous statewide run. However, I believe Forecaster 2 over-interprets absence of evidence as evidence of absence, while Forecaster 3 under-weights how late we are in the cycle.",
    "rationale": "The critical question is whether 'no additional information available' reflects reality (no serious opposition) or research limitations. Forecaster 2's timeline argument is compelling—by June 3 for a June 17 primary, candidate filing is closed and serious challengers would have generated discoverable news. The November 2024 Washington Post article mentioning only Jones supports this. However, Forecaster 2's 95% confidence seems excessive given genuine uncertainty about the field composition. Forecaster 3's structural analysis about NOVA dominance and prosecutor advantages is sophisticated, but assumes facts not in evidence—we don't know there IS a NOVA-based prosecutor opponent. The reference to Jones's 2021 race is useful context suggesting he's viable but not dominant. On balance, the late timeline is highly significant. If there were serious, well-funded opposition, we would likely have some information about it. But without confirmation Jones is unopposed, 95% overestimates our certainty. I'm updating upward from 45% to 65%, acknowledging the timeline makes serious opposition unlikely while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about what we don't know.",
