  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until April 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the currently declared state of emergency is scheduled to expire on April 29, 2025; without an extension or a new declaration, there will be no state of emergency in effect on April 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Temporary generators are installed and stabilise power sufficiently by late April; the government lets the emergency orders lapse on April 29 and does not reissue or extend them.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Commissioning of temporary generators slips past April 29, or grid reliability remains uncertain, prompting Cabinet/PM to extend the emergency into May; alternatively, an unrelated event (e.g., severe weather) triggers a new state of emergency covering April 30.",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors No: the proclamation announced March 31 was for 30 days and explicitly valid through April 29. As of April 21, there were no announced plans to extend, and the National Emergency Operation Centre indicated orders were valid until April 29. My research assistant also notes temporary generators were expected to be operational by end of April, with the permanent fix not until August.\n\nReasons for a higher probability are the seriousness of the power crisis and common schedule risk on island logistics and generator commissioning. Even if gensets arrive, officials might keep the emergency in place a bit longer to manage rationing and procurement until stability is proven. There is also a small tail risk of an unrelated emergency being declared on or before April 30.\n\nBalancing these: I put extra weight on the status quo (no extension announced; explicit end date of April 29), which pulls the forecast down. I still allow meaningful probability (roughly one-in-three) for slippage or a cautious extension given the economic and social impacts reported and the fact the temporary solution targets the same period the orders expire.\n\nWhy not higher: No extension signaled as of April 21; official materials specify April 29 validity; authorities likely hope to lift extraordinary measures once temporary capacity is online. Why not lower: Commissioning delays are plausible; the government may prefer legal flexibility during the handover to temporary generation; and there’s a nonzero chance of a different emergency being declared.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of generator shipment/installation delays into May; continued widespread load shedding through April 27–29; official hints that emergency powers are needed beyond April 29; a new hazard (e.g., severe weather alerts). What would move me down: government statements confirming no extension; reports that temporary generators are installed, tested, and stabilizing the grid before April 27; cancellation or soft-landing plans communicated by NEOC or the PM.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
