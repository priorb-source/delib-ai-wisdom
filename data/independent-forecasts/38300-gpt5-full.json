  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (Metaculus will check on/after June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — YoY growth remains > 0%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A broad, unexpected May pullback (≈1% m/m or worse) — e.g., a simultaneous dip in oil extraction/refining and core manufacturing (autos, machinery, chemicals) — coincides with a relatively strong May 2024 base, pulling May 2025 YoY to ≤ 0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May industrial production is flat to slightly higher m/m, with auto assemblies rebounding, energy output steady, and no broad-based contraction. Even if the May 2024 base was a bit higher than April 2024, April’s +1.49% YoY cushion keeps May’s YoY > 0%.",
    "rationale": "Starting point matters. April 2025 YoY for INDPRO was +1.49%. For May to print ≤ 0% YoY, May 2025 would likely need to fall below May 2024’s level. Using a simple base-effect check: if May 2024 was ~0.5–1.0% above April 2024, then May 2025 would need roughly a ~0.9% to ~0.5% m/m decline, respectively, to turn YoY nonpositive; if May 2024 was flat vs April 2024, it would take an even larger ~1.5% m/m drop. That is possible but not the base case. \nEvidence and status quo: The research assistant notes YoY momentum improving through early 2025 (-0.2% in Jan, +0.45% Feb, +0.85% Mar, +1.49% Apr). May forward indicators are mixed but not weak: ISM/S&P Global PMIs above/better than 50, rail car-loadings and electricity output tracking close to April, and auto assemblies rebounding. April’s rebound was energy-led (oil extraction and processing up), and while the global demand outlook is softening, there is no immediate sign of a sharp May energy or manufacturing drop. This supports a modestly positive May m/m change or near-flat outcome, which should keep YoY positive given April’s cushion. \nWhy not higher? Risks include: (1) a relatively strong May 2024 base, (2) the noted ongoing weakness in non-energy processing industries, (3) the sharp decline in the LEI and broader global manufacturing softness, and (4) normal IP volatility — a one-month -0.5% to -1.0% swing is not rare. Any sizeable pullback in energy (oil output/refining) or a reversal in autos could be enough to shave YoY toward zero. \nWhy not lower? Multiple near-term indicators suggest stability or slight expansion for May, and it would take an unusually large, broad-based decline to erase April’s +1.49% YoY buffer. Autos rebounding and steady electricity/rail proxies tilt against a sharp contraction. \nWhat would move me up? Evidence of solid May hard data before the G.17 (e.g., strong auto assemblies, higher refinery runs, rising weekly petroleum production, firm manufacturing hours), or signs the May 2024 base was not meaningfully above April 2024. \nWhat would move me down? Reports of notable May output disruptions (refinery outages, drilling slowdown), weak manufacturing hours, or indications that May 2024 was a materially high base relative to April 2024 and May 2025 saw a clear m/m dip.",
