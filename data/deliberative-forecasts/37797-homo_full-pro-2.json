    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. Both other experts, like myself, assess the probability of a change to the FATF black list in June 2025 as low, independently arriving at a 10% forecast. The reasoning is remarkably consistent across all analyses, centering on two key points: 1) The extremely high inertia of the black list, meaning changes are rare and require significant catalysts. 2) A detailed breakdown of why removals (for North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) are nearly impossible in the short term and why additions are also highly unlikely. All analyses correctly identify Russia as the only plausible, albeit improbable, candidate for addition, noting the major political and economic barriers that have prevented this action for over two years. No new evidence or novel arguments were raised; rather, the process served as a strong confirmation of the initial reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other two forecasters, I will not be changing my forecast. Their reasoning aligns perfectly with my own, strengthening my confidence in the initial assessment. The core logic, shared by all, is that the FATF black list is characterized by significant inertia. The conditions for removing any of the incumbent jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) are not remotely close to being met. The only plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome is the addition of a new jurisdiction, with Russia being the sole candidate of note. However, adding a major economy and UN Security Council member is a monumental step that the FATF has consistently avoided, opting instead for membership suspension. This status quo has held for over two years, indicating a lack of consensus for escalation. Without a major new geopolitical trigger, this is unlikely to change. The deliberation process did not introduce any new information that would alter this calculation. The strong consensus solidifies the view that a change is unlikely, and my 10% forecast remains an appropriate quantification of the small but non-zero tail risk of a surprise geopolitical event forcing the FATF's hand.",
