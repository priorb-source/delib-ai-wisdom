    "review": "The three forecasts are remarkably convergent (87%, 92%, 93%), indicating strong agreement on fundamentals. All analyses correctly identify the short timeframe, entrenched censorship regimes, and status quo bias. However, Forecaster 3's characterization of Venezuela as having 'intermittent' blocks is an important detail I should have weighted more heavily. More critically, I need to emphasize the compound probability issue: the question requires ALL SEVEN countries to maintain blocks for a Yes resolution. Even with individually high probabilities, the compound effect matters. If we estimate rough individual maintenance probabilities (China/North Korea ~99.5%, Iran ~99%, Russia/Turkmenistan ~98%, Myanmar ~95%, Venezuela ~90%), the compound probability is approximately 81-85% before considering Wikipedia-specific factors. Forecaster 2's slightly lower 87% forecast may better capture this compound risk across multiple countries, particularly given Venezuela's volatility. The other forecasters also appropriately note that Wikipedia editorial decisions could reclassify listings independent of actual policy changes, adding another layer of uncertainty beyond just government policy.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should moderate my forecast downward slightly to better account for compound probabilities. While each individual country has a high likelihood of maintaining its X/Twitter block, the requirement that ALL SEVEN must remain listed creates multiplicative risk. Venezuela represents the highest individual risk given its intermittent blocking history. Myanmar is second-highest risk due to potential post-coup policy fluidity. Even small individual probabilities of change compound across seven countries. Additionally, Wikipedia editorial factors—including potential reclassifications, consensus discussions, or how 'currently' is interpreted for intermittent blocks—add uncertainty beyond pure policy analysis. The 26-day timeframe still strongly favors status quo, and these regimes are genuinely entrenched, but I was slightly underweighting the tail risks from having seven separate points of potential failure. My updated forecast of 89% better reflects the compound probability structure while maintaining that the status quo remains highly likely.",
