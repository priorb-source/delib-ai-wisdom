    "review": "My initial forecast of 95% was overconfident. I relied too heavily on the news reports of an increased stake to 7% and did not sufficiently consider countervailing factors or alternative interpretations. Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial points that I missed. First, Forecaster 2 rightly noted the mathematical effect of Domino's own share buybacks, which would mechanically increase Berkshire's ownership percentage without any action on their part. This introduces ambiguity. Second, both forecasters correctly pointed out the potential for journalistic imprecision—that '7%' could be a loose rounding of the previous stake (~6.7%). This possibility of misinterpretation is a significant source of uncertainty. Forecaster 3 also made a strong case for giving more weight to the macro signal that Berkshire was a net seller in Q1, which establishes a higher bar for them to be buying anything. Forecaster 3's 44% feels too low, as it seems to dismiss the specific news reports almost entirely. Forecaster 2's 72% seems more balanced, but I remain more confident than them in the specificity of the reporting.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 95% to 85%. My confidence has been tempered by two key arguments. The first is the ambiguity surrounding the '7%' figure reported in the news, as highlighted by both other forecasters. It is possible this is a rounding of the previous ~6.7% stake, especially when accounting for the modest floating-point increase caused by Domino's own share buybacks. The second is the broader context that Berkshire was a net seller of equities in Q1 2025, which makes any new purchase less likely by default. However, I am keeping my forecast well above 50% because the core piece of evidence remains very strong. The research assistant's report states 'Multiple news articles... reported that the company had *further increased* its stake... to 7%.' The critical phrase is 'further increased.' This implies an action (a purchase), not just a static state. It is less likely that multiple news outlets would independently misreport both the direction (an increase) and the rounded number simultaneously, especially just after the annual meeting when information is fresh. While Berkshire was a net seller, the report confirms they were also selectively adding to certain positions, so an addition to Domino's fits this established pattern. The math shows the buybacks alone are insufficient to get the stake to 7.0%, so the story almost requires a purchase to be accurate. Therefore, I believe it is highly probable, but not certain, that a purchase occurred.",
