    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize bureaucratic inertia and the short runway to July 1, which I agree are the dominant factors. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point about the ease/speed of taking the page offline, which would resolve as No. However, I disagree with Forecaster 2’s implication that a formal public comment process is required—CDC guidance can be changed quickly without rulemaking, reducing the timeline barrier somewhat. The political context (new administration scrutiny) keeps a non-trivial tail risk that the numeric recommendation could be suspended or the page altered/removed ahead of the review’s completion.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: CDC has held 0.7 mg/L since 2015, and from April 10 to now (May 20) no change has surfaced, suggesting inertia. While HHS announced a review, agencies commonly keep existing guidance in place pending results. That favors a Yes outcome. Countervailing risk: Because this is guidance (not regulation), the CDC/HHS could rapidly adjust site language or temporarily remove the numeric recommendation without formal process. The current political environment increases this risk compared to a typical year. The fact that ~40 days have already passed post-announcement without a change modestly reduces near-term hazard, but the remaining ~6 weeks still allow for a swift top-down edit if leadership prioritizes it. Net: I slightly lower my prior (88%) to reflect the realistic possibility of a quick non-procedural change or page takedown, while keeping a strong lean to Yes based on status quo inertia and the usual practice of maintaining guidance during a review.",
