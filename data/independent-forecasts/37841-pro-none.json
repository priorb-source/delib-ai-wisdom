    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival is scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kneecap performs at Glastonbury 2025 as they are currently on the official lineup.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following sustained political and media pressure, and potentially based on advice from the Metropolitan Police regarding their ongoing investigation, the Glastonbury organisers remove Kneecap from the lineup to mitigate security risks, political fallout, or legal complications.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Glastonbury organisers stand by their decision to book Kneecap, consistent with the festival's history of platforming controversial and political acts, and the band performs their scheduled set without being officially removed from the lineup.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high probability of the status quo holding. Kneecap is currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup. The festival has a very long and public history of supporting artists with controversial and left-leaning political views, and of resisting pressure from right-leaning media and politicians. The organisers, the Eavis family, would have been fully aware of the controversies surrounding the band when they were booked, suggesting they have already accepted the political context of the performance. The festival is just over a month away, and cancelling a confirmed act at this stage is a significant step that organisers typically avoid unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe main factor preventing a higher probability is the active police investigation into the band's alleged comments. This is more serious than simple media backlash. If the police were to recommend the cancellation on security grounds, or if formal charges were brought against band members before the festival, Glastonbury would likely be compelled to remove them from the bill. This represents the most plausible path to a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower because police investigations can be lengthy, and it is entirely possible that no conclusion will be reached before the festival date. In the absence of a direct and formal intervention from law enforcement, Glastonbury is highly likely to weather the storm of criticism and allow the performance to proceed, viewing it as a matter of artistic freedom consistent with the festival's ethos.\n\nI would increase my forecast if Glastonbury organisers issue a statement of support for the band, or if the police announce they are dropping their investigation. I would decrease my forecast significantly if the police investigation results in charges or if a credible security threat linked to the band's performance is officially identified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
