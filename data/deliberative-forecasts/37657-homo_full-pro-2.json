    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all agree on the primary factors driving a low probability: the very short timeframe (~6 weeks), the lack of any signals from enhanced global surveillance, the virus's low cell-entry efficiency, and the low historical base rate of zoonotic spillovers. The forecasts of 1% and 2% reflect a minor difference in weighing the small, unquantifiable tail risks. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning to be sound and clear. Forecaster 3 introduced no new evidence but articulated the reasons for a non-zero forecast particularly well, specifically highlighting the virus's dangerous Merbecovirus family and explicitly mentioning the background rate for lab accidents. This strengthened the case for not going as low as 1%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, my analysis remains largely unchanged, but my confidence in it is reinforced. The arguments presented by the other experts align perfectly with my own initial assessment. The combination of an extremely short time remaining until the resolution date (July 1, 2025) and the complete absence of any detected human cases from robust, active surveillance systems makes the 'No' outcome highly probable. The biological evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 has significantly lower cell-entry efficiency than SARS-CoV-2 provides a strong mechanistic reason for this lack of spillover. I am maintaining my forecast at 2% and not lowering it to 1% based on the deliberation. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the virus belonging to the Merbecovirus family (which includes the dangerous MERS-CoV) and the background risk of a laboratory accident—however small—persuades me that 2% better captures this non-zero tail risk compared to 1%. The core assessment is unchanged: a human case is highly unlikely in the given timeframe, but not impossible.",
