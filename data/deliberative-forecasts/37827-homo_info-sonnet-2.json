    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critical new information about historical base rates (4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years), yielding approximately 4.2% monthly probability. This is much lower than I estimated. Forecaster 3 makes excellent points about NUFORC's US-centric nature that I underweighted - most reports come from North America, and African pilots face barriers including awareness of NUFORC, language, and internet access. Both forecasters correctly note the 30-day window is a significant constraint.\n\nReviewing my own reasoning, I made a conceptual error: I estimated 3-6 annual reports but then didn't properly translate this to monthly probability with appropriate statistical modeling. I was also overly optimistic based on the single Rwanda example without adequately considering how exceptional such reports might be. The Rwanda January 2025 report proves this CAN happen, but doesn't establish it happens frequently.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overestimated the probability. Key corrections to my thinking:\n\n1. **Base Rate Reality**: Even accepting my estimate of 3-6 annual reports (which may itself be optimistic), this translates to roughly 0.25-0.5 reports per month. Using Poisson probability, this yields approximately 22-39% for at least one report per month - but this assumes my annual estimate is correct.\n\n2. **NUFORC's US Focus**: I failed to adequately weight that NUFORC receives predominantly US reports. African pilots are less likely to know about or use this specific US-based reporting system. This is a major factor reducing probability.\n\n3. **Historical Evidence**: Forecaster 2's claim of 4-6 reports over 10 years (if accurate) suggests a much lower base rate of ~0.042 reports per month, yielding ~4% probability. This is more conservative than my estimate.\n\n4. **The Rwanda Example**: While it proves such reports occur, one data point from early 2025 doesn't establish a trend. It could be an occasional occurrence in line with a low historical base rate.\n\nBalancing these factors: The question requires only ONE report from 54 countries over 30 days, and we have proof it can happen. However, the historical scarcity, NUFORC's US focus, and the narrow time window all push probability down significantly from my original 30%.\n\nI'm updating to 13%, splitting the difference between Forecaster 2's conservative 5% and Forecaster 3's 12%, while acknowledging my original estimate was too optimistic.",
