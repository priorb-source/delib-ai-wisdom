  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no referendum date is announced and the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government continues its current strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services as announced in April 2025. With the UK government's continued opposition, the 2022 Supreme Court ruling limiting unilateral action, and political constraints from the upcoming by-election (May 15 - June 5) and council workers strike ballot (closing June 12), no announcement is made before July 1, 2025. The government continues to view independence as a longer-term goal aligned with Nicola Sturgeon's assessment that a referendum is unlikely before the 2030s.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite current political constraints, First Minister John Swinney decides to announce a date for an independence referendum, perhaps scheduled for 2026 or 2027. This could be triggered by sustained pro-independence polling, pressure from the SNP base, or as a strategic move ahead of the May 2026 Holyrood elections. Even if the UK government declares it illegal, the announcement itself by Scottish authorities would satisfy the resolution criteria. The announcement could come in mid-June after the by-election period.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. With only 2 months remaining, several factors make an announcement unlikely: (1) Recent government statements from April 2025 emphasize priorities other than independence; (2) Nicola Sturgeon explicitly called a referendum 'off the radar' until the 2030s; (3) Political constraints exist through early June due to the by-election (government guidance against major announcements May 15 - June 5) and council workers strike ballot; (4) The 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling limits Scotland's unilateral authority; (5) Both UK Labour and Scottish Labour oppose a referendum. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) The question only requires an announcement of a date, not holding the referendum itself; (2) Even a non-binding referendum announcement would count; (3) A date could be announced for the distant future (2026-2027); (4) John Swinney did call independence an 'urgent priority' in January 2025; (5) Political surprises occur, and the remaining window after June 12 could theoretically see an announcement. The 2-month timeframe, combined with recent focus on other priorities and explicit statements that a referendum is 'off the radar,' makes this unlikely. To update higher, I would need evidence of: imminent announcement signals, sudden shift in government messaging, or crisis that changes political calculus. To update lower, I would need explicit statements ruling out any announcement in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
