  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The international conference in June 2025 concludes without any participating country making an immediate, official announcement of recognition. Diplomatic momentum stalls, and potential recognizers decide to await further developments or a more opportune moment, resulting in no new recognitions during June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The high-level international conference in mid-June serves as a catalyst. Spurred by diplomatic efforts from France, Saudi Arabia, and the 'Madrid+' group, at least one UN member state, potentially a European country like Belgium, Malta or the UK, officially announces its recognition of Palestine during or immediately after the conference.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant diplomatic momentum centered on the UN conference scheduled for June 17-20, 2025. This event, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is explicitly designed to encourage new recognitions of Palestine, making it a powerful action-forcing event. The recent news of the UK joining this initiative, coupled with the advocacy from the 'Madrid+' group (Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Norway), creates a concerted push that makes an announcement from at least one country probable within the short timeframe of the conference and the remainder of the month. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is low—only a single UN member country needs to make the move.\n\nMy probability is not higher because state recognition is a major sovereign act that can face internal procedural delays or significant external diplomatic counter-pressure, particularly from the United States or Israel. Countries may express intent at the conference but delay the official announcement until after June to coordinate a broader response or to see how the diplomatic landscape settles. The status quo, where nations avoid such a decisive step, remains a powerful force.\n\nMy probability is not lower because dismissing this concentration of diplomatic will would be an error. The key players involved and the specific, time-bound objective of the conference make June a focal point for action. To forecast a lower probability would be to assume this major international effort is likely to fail to persuade even one nation to act on its stated goals.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports or leaks ahead of the conference that a specific country or group of countries had already finalized plans for a June announcement. I would decrease my forecast if the conference were postponed, or if key advocates like France or the UK publicly softened their position and instead emphasized a longer-term process over immediate action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
