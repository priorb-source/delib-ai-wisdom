    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds specific endorsements (AOC for Mamdani; Orthodox Jewish leaders, Puerto Rican figures, Marc Anthony for Cuomo) that I hadn’t incorporated. I treat the AOC endorsement as especially mobilizing for the progressive base; celebrity and ethnic-community endorsements can help but are usually less determinative than unions or major editorial boards. Forecaster 3 contributes concrete polling: multiple polls from March–late May with Cuomo leading by double digits and, importantly, a Marist RCV simulation showing Cuomo clearing 50% in later rounds. That RCV simulation is the strongest new piece of evidence, though the noted narrowing trend (SurveyUSA to Emerson) and Cuomo’s potential second-choice weakness temper confidence. I find F3’s 77% too high given RCV and Cuomo’s negatives; F2’s 60% is closer to my prior but likely a bit low given the breadth of polling and the RCV sim.",
    "rationale": "Netting all inputs: Cuomo’s first-choice lead across several polls and a reputable RCV simulation implying he ultimately surpasses 50% suggest he is more likely than not to win. His name ID, resources, targeted Hispanic outreach, and plausible outer-borough/older voter strength add to that. On the other side, the race appears to be tightening, Mamdani has a strong progressive apparatus and AOC’s endorsement, and Cuomo’s high negatives raise the risk that transfers break against him in later RCV rounds. Given the time remaining (two weeks), volatility remains but late reversals from a persistent multi-poll lead are uncommon without a shock. I’m nudging my estimate up from 56% to reflect the multi-poll evidence and RCV simulation, but staying well below Forecaster 3’s level due to credible RCV/transfer and late-momentum risks.",
