    "review": "Both forecasters add useful detail that leans slightly more bearish than my prior. Forecaster 2 highlights the breadth of the deterioration—\"pervasive and unanimous\" and four straight monthly declines—arguing trend persistence is hard to reverse in one month. Forecaster 3 cites very elevated inflation expectations (6.7%, highest since 1981) and unemployment expectations (highest since 2009), plus falling LEIs, framing the drivers as structural (tariffs) rather than transient. Those specifics strengthen the case that headwinds could persist into the May preliminary survey and make a bounce less likely. I agree with both that mean reversion from an extreme is real and the threshold (50.8) is low, but their emphasis on the breadth and structural nature of the shock is a meaningful counterweight I underweighted. The one caveat: Michigan expectations and headline sentiment can be volatile, so extremely high readings can ease without fundamentals improving. Still, their arguments modestly lower the odds of clearing 50.8 absent a clear positive catalyst before the early-May survey window.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see two opposing forces: (1) a strong base-effect/mean-reversion tendency from a near-record low that makes even a small uptick sufficient for a Yes; versus (2) sustained, salient negatives (tariff-related price hikes, high inflation expectations, recession worries, equity volatility, seasonal firmness in gasoline) that could keep expectations depressed. The added points about the depth and unanimity of April’s decline and historically elevated inflation/unemployment expectations suggest the negative narrative is entrenched enough that a quick rebound above 50.8 is less likely than I initially assessed. There is still a nontrivial path to Yes via modest market stabilization, fewer alarming price-hike headlines, or simple statistical bounce, but on balance the structural/persistent angle pushes me modestly lower. I also note timing: the preliminary May reading typically lands before mid-month macro prints, so fewer opportunities for a fresh positive data surprise to lift sentiment in time. Net: I trim my probability but keep it not too far below even given the low bar and the volatility of the series.",
