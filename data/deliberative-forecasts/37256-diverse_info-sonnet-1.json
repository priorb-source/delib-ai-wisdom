    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents crucial new information I lacked: the Trade Minister's April 2025 reaffirmation of commitment, Chamber of Commerce support, and February 2025 EAC preparatory work. This evidence of recent political momentum is significant and updates me upward from my initial 2% forecast. However, Forecaster 2's 65% probability appears to insufficiently weight the concrete evidence against ratification. Specifically, they don't address the published May-June 2025 legislative calendar showing zero trade-related bills - this is objective, verifiable evidence that directly contradicts their optimism. They also don't adequately account for the April 2025 arrest of the Vice-President and senior officials, which represents a major political crisis occurring simultaneously with the Trade Minister's statement.\n\nForecaster 3's 20% forecast provides a more balanced analysis. They appropriately weight both the theoretical possibility of fast-tracking with political will against the historical evidence of slow treaty processing (6 years for Maputo Protocol) and current legislative dysfunction. Their acknowledgment that ratification requires three distinct steps (TNLA passage, presidential assent, AU deposit) highlights the procedural complexity that must be navigated in just 60 days.\n\nThe key tension is between aspirational political statements (Trade Minister) versus concrete institutional evidence (legislative calendar, budget allocation, meeting frequency). In forecasting, published calendars and institutional capacity typically prove more predictive than ministerial statements. The VP's arrest in late April further suggests governmental dysfunction rather than coordinated policy execution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm updating upward from my initial 2% but remaining far below Forecaster 2's 65%. The Trade Minister's April 2025 commitment is meaningful new information that warrants increased probability. However, this must be weighed against multiple concrete factors:\n\n1. The published May-June 2025 legislative calendar contains no trade bills - this is hard evidence of non-prioritization\n2. The legislature met only 32 days in six months (H2 2024), demonstrating severe capacity constraints\n3. The April 2025 arrest of the Vice-President indicates acute political instability occurring concurrent with the Trade Minister's statement\n4. No Finance Ministry budget exists for AfCFTA obligations\n5. The fiscal crisis from pipeline shutdown constrains governmental capacity\n6. Only 60 days remain for a multi-step process (TNLA passage, presidential assent, AU deposit)\n\nForecaster 3's reasoning about the procedural complexity and historical slow processing is compelling. While fast-tracking is theoretically possible with strong political will, the absence of any visible legislative preparation suggests such will hasn't translated to action. Ministerial statements often reflect aspiration rather than imminent execution, particularly in resource-constrained governments facing multiple crises.\n\nI'm moving to 10% to acknowledge: (a) recent political signals do suggest some momentum, (b) peer pressure from continental integration may matter, and (c) emergency procedures could theoretically compress timelines. However, the weight of evidence still strongly favors status quo inertia.",
