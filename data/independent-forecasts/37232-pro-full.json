  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025, which is approximately one month from the time of this forecast.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current status is that Virgin Galactic has not posted on its News page for three consecutive months (February, March, April 2025). A continuation of this trend through May would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic decides to share a significant update on the assembly of its new Delta class spaceplanes, or announces a new strategic partnership, and posts an article about it on its News page in May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic continues its current communications pattern. The company focuses on its flight hiatus and the long-term development of the Delta fleet, without any specific milestones deemed newsworthy for the main News page in May. The Q1 earnings report is handled exclusively through the Investor Relations channel, as was past practice.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on Virgin Galactic's recent communication patterns and its current operational status. The most significant factor is the existing three-month gap in posts on their News page, which indicates a low frequency of updates. This is further supported by a similar four-month gap in 2024. The company is in a flight hiatus until 2026, which naturally reduces the volume of operational news typically shared with the public. While the company will release its Q1 2025 financial results on May 15, the research indicates that such announcements are typically confined to the Investor Relations section and not cross-posted to the main News page. Therefore, this scheduled event is unlikely to trigger a 'No' resolution. The primary uncertainty stems from the possibility of an unscheduled announcement, such as a major milestone in the Delta class vehicle assembly. However, without a specific reason to expect such a post in May, the established pattern of infrequent updates is the most reliable guide. My probability is not higher because corporate communication strategies can change, and an unforeseen development could warrant a press release at any time. It is not lower because the combination of the flight hiatus and the established practice of siloing financial news creates a strong expectation that the page will remain dormant.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
