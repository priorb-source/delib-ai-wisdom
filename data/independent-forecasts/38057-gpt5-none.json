    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4 months (on UFC 316 fight night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — multiple No paths (opponent change/cancellation, O’Malley win, draw/NC) collectively outweigh the single Yes path.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One fighter withdraws and Merab fights someone else (or doesn’t fight) at UFC 316; or the bout happens and O’Malley wins; or the result is a draw/no-contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The bout happens as booked at UFC 316 and Dvalishvili wins (decision or finish).",
    "rationale": "Framing: This is a conjunction: Merab must both face O’Malley at UFC 316 and defeat him. So P(Yes) = P(fight occurs as booked) × P(Merab wins | fight occurs).\n\nScheduling/cancellation risk: Given the ESPN listing, it’s likely booked, but we’re still months out. Historically, headliners several months away face non-trivial risk of withdrawal or reshuffle. I estimate ~75–85% that the bout happens with the same pairing; I’ll use 0.78 as a mid-range assumption.\n\nIn-cage matchup: Merab’s relentless wrestling/pace vs. O’Malley’s elite striking and timing. Without current market odds, I center near competitive but give a slight stylistic lean to Merab over five rounds due to pressure, clinch control, and cardio. The label “Dvalishvili vs. O’Malley 2” implies a prior meeting; if that prior fight was a Merab win, he’s plausibly a slight favorite; if it was an O’Malley win, he might be favored. Lacking confirmation, I split the difference and set P(Merab wins | fight occurs) ≈ 0.58 based on stylistic factors and five-round dynamics.\n\nPutting it together: 0.78 × 0.58 ≈ 0.45 → 45%.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) There’s still meaningful opponent-change/cancellation risk months out. (2) O’Malley’s KO threat and improving takedown defense can flip rounds quickly; if judges reward damage over control, that also benefits him. (3) If the prior fight favored O’Malley, rematch adjustments could tilt further his way.\n\nWhy not lower: (1) Merab’s grinding style and cardio are proven five-round assets and classically troublesome for long-range strikers. (2) If the prior meeting favored Merab, immediate rematches often preserve the stylistic edge. (3) Even with cancellation risk, most booked PPV headliners do occur.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation both fighters are healthy and within camp, on-time visa/travel, and successful fight-week weigh-ins (removing most cancellation risk); betting markets or expert analysis making Merab a clear favorite; evidence the first fight was a decisive Merab win or that O’Malley struggled badly with the wrestling.\n\nWhat would move me down: News of injuries/camp issues for Merab; market odds installing O’Malley as a clear favorite; credible reports of O’Malley’s improved takedown defense/scrambling or Merab showing diminished durability; any hint of opponent change.\n\nResearch assistant: No additional information was provided; the forecast relies on general base rates, matchup analysis, and the ESPN labeling.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
