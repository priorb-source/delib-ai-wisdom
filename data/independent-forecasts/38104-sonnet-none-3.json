    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - at least one or more escapees remain at large through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the remaining escapees successfully evades capture through July 1 by leaving the area, having external support, or finding effective hiding locations. As time passes, trails grow cold and the most resourceful escapee(s) continue to avoid law enforcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive law enforcement efforts, including potential federal assistance, public tips, and coordinated searches, result in the rapid recapture of all remaining escapees within the next 32 days. The escapees make mistakes, are recognized by the public, or are turned in by associates.",
    "rationale": "According to the report from May 19 (3 days post-escape), 3 of the 10 escapees had been recaptured, leaving 7 at large. With 14 days having passed since the escape and no updated information available, the status quo suggests several escapees likely remain free. Historical patterns show that recapture rates decline sharply after the initial days - the easiest targets are caught first, while those who evade capture longer tend to be more resourceful or have better support networks. The question structure heavily favors a No outcome since ALL 10 must be recaptured for Yes, while just ONE remaining free results in No. With approximately 32 days remaining and potentially 5-7 escapees still at large (assuming 1-2 more captured since May 19), the probability of complete recapture is constrained. Law enforcement resources may be stretched, some escapees may have left Louisiana entirely, and the longer timeline allows for more evasion opportunities. My forecast would be higher if: (1) I had evidence of additional recent captures, (2) there were reports of intensive federal involvement, or (3) the timeframe were longer. It would be lower if I had evidence that sophisticated or violent offenders were among those still at large, or if any had definitely left the state.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
