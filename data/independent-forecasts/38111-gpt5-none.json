    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (window: June 1–30, 2025; resolution by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite diplomatic chatter, no government crosses the line in June: the UK is in election purdah and avoids major policy moves; France continues to coordinate an initiative but delays a formal recognition pending broader EU alignment or a ceasefire framework; other Western non-recognizers (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Japan) maintain current positions; Al Jazeera’s tracker shows no new recognitions in June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country outside the core Western holdouts moves in June—e.g., France decides to proceed unilaterally or with a small EU cohort (Malta/Luxembourg/Belgium), or a remaining Caribbean/Pacific holdout flips—possibly timed to a diplomatic milestone (ceasefire framework, UN/European meetings). An official recognition announcement is made in June and reflected on Al Jazeera’s tracker.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Most UN members that are likely to recognize Palestine already have; the remaining non-recognizers are concentrated among Western allies (US, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Italy, etc.) and a few Pacific/Caribbean states that historically align with Israel. These actors tend to move cautiously and in coordination, which makes any given month’s chance of a new recognition modest absent a clear trigger.\n\nContext: The UK joined France’s initiative in May 2025, signaling momentum, but the UK’s general election on July 4 puts it in pre-election purdah, reducing the likelihood of a June recognition by London. France is the most plausible major mover, yet Paris has historically tied recognition to diplomatic sequencing and broader European coordination; an immediate June step is possible but far from assured. Other plausible EU candidates (Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium) could move, but none has clearly signaled an imminent June announcement. Outside Europe, remaining holdouts (e.g., some Caribbean or Pacific states) could flip without long lead time, but base rates are low and recent recognition waves largely played out in 2024.\n\nStatus-quo weight: Given how slowly recognition positions shift—especially among the remaining non-recognizers—the default is no new recognition in any particular month. That said, the French-led initiative and ongoing Gaza-related diplomacy create a non-trivial chance that at least one country times an announcement to a June diplomatic moment.\n\nAssistant’s info: The research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast relies on public context and base rates.\n\nWhy not higher: The principal likely movers (UK, France) face near-term constraints (UK purdah; French preference for coordination). Most other non-recognizers have high thresholds for change.\n\nWhy not lower: Diplomacy can catalyze quick shifts; a single small or mid-sized state (e.g., Malta or a Caribbean holdout) is sufficient for a Yes. France’s initiative adds real, if moderate, upside risk.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of France or a small EU group scheduling June recognition; a ceasefire/peace framework explicitly linked to recognition; leaks of cabinet-level decisions in Malta/Luxembourg/Belgium; signals from a Caribbean or Pacific government of imminent recognition.\n\nWhat would move me down: Public statements from France deferring recognition beyond June; clear denials from the most plausible candidates; escalation in Gaza that makes coordinated recognition less likely this month; lack of any movement by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
