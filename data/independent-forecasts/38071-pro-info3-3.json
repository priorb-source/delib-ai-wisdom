  "information": "An internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "Levar Stoney wins the primary, as he is the current frontrunner according to a March 2025 internal poll. This would result in a 'No' outcome for this question.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages his political base in Richmond and name recognition to consolidate support among the large bloc of undecided voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Stoney wins the primary with a plurality, and Aaron Rouse is unable to significantly expand his support beyond his Hampton Roads base.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse runs a strong campaign in the final weeks, successfully energizing his base in Hampton Roads for high turnout while winning over a significant portion of the undecided voters in Northern Virginia and other regions. He benefits from a late surge in momentum and secures a plurality victory.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is primarily based on a March 2025 internal poll for the Levar Stoney campaign, which places Stoney ahead of Aaron Rouse 16% to 10%, with 8% for Ghazala Hashmi. The most crucial factor from this poll is that 63% of voters were undecided a few months ago. This indicates an extremely fluid race where the outcome is highly uncertain. Stoney's lead, though small, makes him the marginal favorite; therefore, the status quo outcome is a loss for Rouse. For Rouse to win, he must capture a disproportionate share of the undecided voters. His path involves maximizing turnout in his Hampton Roads base and making significant inroads in the vote-rich Northern Virginia region, which lacks a home candidate. My probability of 40% reflects that Rouse is a strong contender with a clear path to victory, but he is still starting from behind the current, albeit slight, frontrunner. My forecast is not higher because Stoney holds the lead, and incumbency or frontrunner status provides a tangible advantage. My forecast is not lower because with 63% of the electorate undecided, a 6-point gap is well within the range of being surmountable in the final weeks of a campaign. I would increase my forecast if new public polling showed Rouse closing the gap or taking the lead, or if he secured major endorsements from Northern Virginia. I would decrease it if polling showed Stoney solidifying his lead or if another candidate surged, further splitting the non-Stoney vote.",
