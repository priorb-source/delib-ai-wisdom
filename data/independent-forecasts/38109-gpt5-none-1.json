    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until the end of June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent new evidence, Kalshi has generally not been permitted to run real-money sports event contracts under existing CFTC interpretations, and there’s no clear, public indication they already list daily MLB game markets.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi does not list MLB game markets at all in June due to regulatory constraints on “gaming” event contracts, or they list some but miss even a single calendar day (e.g., compliance pause, operational hiccup, weekend gap, or site maintenance) — any miss yields No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi already has, or promptly launches, compliant real-money MLB game markets and keeps at least one MLB game market live every single day of June 2025 without missing a day.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and status quo: The CFTC has historically treated sports event contracts as prohibited “gaming” (e.g., the 2021 ErisX NFL disapproval) and has been cautious on retail-facing event contracts generally. Kalshi’s core offerings have centered on economics/weather, and its high-profile legal dispute with the CFTC has focused on elections, not sports. Given that backdrop, the status quo points toward Kalshi not offering daily MLB markets. Good forecasting practice is to overweight that status quo unless strong contrary evidence appears.\n- Link/context provided: The prompt links to a Kalshi sports/baseball page for resolution reference, but our research assistant has no confirmation that real-money MLB markets are actually live. A placeholder/tag page alone does not imply compliant, continuous daily offerings.\n- Strict resolution bar: The bar is “every day in June.” Even if Kalshi did launch MLB markets, one missed day (compliance check, technical outage, or strategic pause) resolves to No. MLB has games essentially every day in June, so the binding constraint is Kalshi’s listing behavior and continuity, not the schedule.\n- Why not higher: To justify a higher probability, I’d need hard evidence that Kalshi is currently running daily MLB markets or has secured CFTC comfort/no-action relief for sports. Without that, the regulatory base rate keeps the odds low, and the “every day” requirement adds fragility.\n- Why not lower: It’s possible Kalshi has recently expanded into sports with a structure acceptable to the regulator, or could pilot limited MLB markets imminently. If such offerings already exist at the turn of the month, maintaining daily continuity for 30 days is feasible for a mature exchange.\n- Updates that would move the forecast up: Verified live MLB game markets on Kalshi in the first few days of June; an announced regulatory green light or no-action position for sports contracts; third-party trackers showing uninterrupted daily listings.\n- Updates that would move it down: Any day early in June with no MLB market on Kalshi; an adverse regulatory/operational development (e.g., policy guidance or platform pause) that would disrupt daily listing.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so this forecast leans on regulatory base rates and the strictness of the “every day” criterion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kalshi offer markets on daily baseball games every day in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLas Vegas Review-Journal: [Judge says he’ll move quickly on Kalshi prediction market case](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/judge-says-hell-move-quickly-on-kalshi-prediction-market-case-3374672/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, every day in June 2025, [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/?category=sports&tag=baseball) offers a real-money prediction market on at least one Major League Baseball game being played that day.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
