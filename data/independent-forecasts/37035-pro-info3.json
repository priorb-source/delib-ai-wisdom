  "information": "The current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The CDC Travel Health Notice for Colombia remains at Level 2, as the yellow fever outbreak is contained and does not escalate to widespread urban transmission affecting travelers.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current yellow fever outbreak remains largely confined to rural areas with low tourist density. Colombian and international health authorities continue effective surveillance, vaccination, and vector-control measures, preventing any significant spread to major urban centers. The CDC continues to assess the risk to the average U.S. traveler as manageable with the existing precautions, and thus keeps the THN at Level 2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever virus breaks containment and establishes urban transmission cycles in one or more major Colombian cities, such as Bogotá or Medellín. This dramatic increase in the geographic scope and risk profile of the outbreak, posing a direct threat to most international travelers, prompts the CDC to urgently raise the Travel Health Notice to Level 3 ('Reconsider Travel').",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high inertia of government health advisories and the specific nature of the current outbreak. The status quo is that the CDC notice for Colombia is Level 2, and such advisories are not changed lightly. The primary driver for a 'No' outcome is the information from my research assistant indicating the yellow fever outbreak is currently confined to rural departments with low tourist traffic. Crucially, there is no verified urban transmission in major hubs like Bogotá or Medellín. Without a threat in areas frequented by the majority of travelers, the CDC is unlikely to elevate the notice to Level 3 ('Reconsider Travel'). The short timeframe of approximately five weeks until the resolution date also makes a significant escalation less probable, as vector-control and vaccination campaigns are already underway. The threshold for a Level 3 notice is high, typically involving widespread transmission that poses a significant risk to the average traveler and/or overwhelms local health systems, neither of which is currently indicated. My probability is not lower than 8% because vector-borne diseases can be unpredictable. A single case leading to an urban transmission cycle is a low-probability but high-impact event that could trigger a rapid change in the CDC's assessment. My probability is not higher because all current evidence points towards a contained situation. For me to update towards 'Yes,' I would need to see credible reports of sustained, local urban transmission in a major Colombian city. Conversely, reports showing a steady decline in new cases nationwide would cause me to lower my forecast further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
