  "information": "Reports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, as planned protests are already being reported and India has a high frequency of large-scale mobilizations that are captured by the tracker.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Planned large-scale protests are canceled, postponed past the deadline, or fail to reach 10,000 participants. Alternatively, a qualifying protest occurs but is not documented by the Global Protest Tracker for methodological reasons within the resolution timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The planned farmers' march proceeds with over 10,000 participants, or a new protest erupts in response to a political or social issue (such as the recent land law), and the event is subsequently logged in the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors. First, India has a high base rate for large-scale protests, and the Global Protest Tracker has historically cataloged numerous such events in the country, including the massive farmers' protests and Citizenship Act protests. Second, the provided research highlights specific, near-term drivers for protest, most notably a planned march of 10,000 farmers and rallies by the TMC. The recent violent protests in April over a land law also indicate a volatile political climate ripe for mobilization. Third, the 10,000-participant threshold, while significant, is frequently crossed in Indian political action. The primary argument against a 'Yes' is the short, two-month timeframe, as the timing of such events is inherently unpredictable. My probability is not higher because planned protests can be canceled or fail to meet attendance expectations, and there is a small chance of a reporting miss by the tracker. It is not lower because the combination of a high base rate and multiple, specific, plausible triggers makes the occurrence of at least one qualifying protest more likely than not within the given period. I would increase my forecast if a firm date within the window is announced for the farmers' march. I would decrease it if key protest groups announce a de-escalation or postponement of planned actions beyond July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
