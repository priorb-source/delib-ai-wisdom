    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached similar conclusions emphasizing policy inertia and the short timeframe, which reinforces my confidence in the base case. However, Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I had underweighted: the resolution depends on the *exact wording* on a specific webpage, not just whether the policy itself remains unchanged. Even if Tesla remains excluded, BC Hydro could shift to generic language like 'U.S.-produced chargers not eligible' or move brand-specific details to a separate FAQ or eligibility list. This 'resolution quirk' presents a meaningful risk pathway to a No outcome that exists independently of actual policy change. Government websites do get updated for communication or design reasons even when underlying policy hasn't changed. That said, the explicit Tesla callout in the March 12 announcement suggests this was deliberate high-visibility messaging, likely intended to reduce customer confusion. Removing such a prominent brand mention after just 4 months would be somewhat unusual absent a specific reason. The very short timeframe (one month) still strongly favors the status quo both in policy and in webpage content. Forecaster 3's concern is valid but probably represents a 5-8% risk rather than 15-20%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward to account for the webpage wording risk that Forecaster 3 identified. The core reasoning remains strong: the policy is very recent (March 2025), politically motivated, and the one-month timeframe makes reversal highly unlikely. However, I now recognize there's a meaningful but not dominant risk that BC Hydro could change how they communicate the exclusion on that specific page - perhaps moving to generic country-of-origin language, restructuring content, or relocating brand-specific details - even while keeping the underlying policy intact. This is more likely than a full policy reversal but still relatively unlikely given: (1) the deliberate nature of the original Tesla callout, (2) the practical value of explicit brand mentions in reducing customer confusion, (3) the short timeframe making major website redesigns unlikely, and (4) the lack of any evidence suggesting such a communications shift is planned. The explicit Tesla mention serves a customer service function and removing it would likely increase confusion. Balancing the strong status quo bias with the newly identified webpage wording risk, I'm moving from 88% to 85%.",
