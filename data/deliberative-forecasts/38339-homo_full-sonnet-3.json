    "review": "All three forecasters identified similar key factors: the 11-month survival pattern, May 2025 talks focusing on renegotiation, debt settlement blockage, Turkey's opposition, and the short 24-day timeframe. Forecaster 3 makes particularly compelling arguments that I hadn't fully weighted: (1) emphasizing the timeframe as 'extremely short' for major diplomatic shifts, (2) highlighting the €2 billion debt as a barrier Bulgaria 'cannot overcome,' and (3) stressing the significance of the established 11-month pattern. The point about May 2, 2025 being only 35 days ago is especially relevant - if cancellation were imminent, we'd expect different signals from those talks. However, Forecaster 3 may underweight the bankruptcy threat as a forcing function and the unilateral announcement pathway. The financial crisis could compress normal decision timelines, and desperate governments can act faster than normal diplomatic pace suggests.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating downward but not as far as Forecaster 3. The key factors pushing me lower: (1) The very recent renegotiation focus from May 2 shows no imminent cancellation was planned 35 days ago, (2) The 24-day window is genuinely very short for major state decisions requiring cabinet approval and legal review, (3) The 11-month survival pattern is stronger evidence than I initially weighted - if dramatic action were coming, the bankruptcy threat existed months ago. However, I'm not going as low as 12% because: (1) Bulgargaz's reported expectation of 280 million leva loss in 2024 and bankruptcy risk create genuine emergency conditions that could accelerate decisions, (2) The unilateral announcement criteria means Bulgaria could announce even without Turkey's agreement or debt settlement, (3) 24 days is compressed but not impossible for a government announcement, especially under crisis. The most likely scenario remains protracted renegotiation, but the tail risk of emergency government action prevents me from dropping below 16%.",
