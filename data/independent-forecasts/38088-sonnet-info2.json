  "information": "Analysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the 250th-ranked person is currently Giancarlo Devasini of Italy (as of April 30, 2025)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th position continues to be held by a non-U.S. billionaire through July 1, 2025. Minor wealth fluctuations occur but aren't significant enough to change the nationality at this specific ranking. Given that approximately 62% of positions in the 200-300 range are non-U.S. billionaires, and the current occupant is from Italy, this represents continuity with the existing distribution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "U.S. stock markets or tech valuations surge in June 2025, causing several U.S. billionaires to rise in wealth rankings and displace the current 250th position holder. Alternatively, the current 250th-ranked person experiences a significant wealth decline while a U.S. billionaire moves up to take that exact position. This would require meaningful market movements favoring U.S. assets over the next month.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome: the 250th position was held by an Italian billionaire as recently as April 30, and only 33 days remain until resolution. My research assistant indicates that in the 200-300 range, approximately 38% of positions are held by U.S. billionaires, while 62% are non-U.S. This base rate alone suggests relatively low probability for a Yes outcome. Several factors inform my forecast: First, the very short timeframe (just over a month) means limited opportunity for significant ranking changes absent major market disruptions. Second, we're currently in Q2 2025, a period historically associated with weaker U.S. billionaire representation, though moving toward Q3 (July 1) might provide marginal improvement - though not to the extent of Q4's reported strength. Third, the broader trend shows declining U.S. representation on the index (from 40% to 35% over the past year), suggesting structural headwinds. My forecast is not higher because: the status quo is clearly No, the time window is short, and the base rate in this ranking range only shows 38% U.S. representation. My forecast is not lower because: there is inherent volatility in billionaire rankings with market movements, the 38% base rate indicates meaningful U.S. presence in this tier, and we could see favorable market movements for U.S. assets. I would revise upward if U.S. markets significantly outperformed other major markets in early June, or if specific news suggested wealth changes among billionaires near this ranking. I would revise downward if I learned the current gap between U.S. and non-U.S. wealth at this ranking was substantial, making displacement unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
