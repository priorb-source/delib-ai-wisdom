    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental analysis. We all identify the extremely short timeframe (under two months) and the significant inertia of both the US legal and immigration enforcement systems as the primary drivers of the forecast. We all agree that the status quo outcome is 'No' and that a 'Yes' would require an unusually rapid sequence of events. The only point of divergence is the final probability, with Forecaster 3 assigning a 10% chance versus the 5% assigned by myself and Forecaster 2. Forecaster 3's reasoning—that the system is *capable* of moving quickly even if it rarely does—is a valid point and a good check against underestimating tail risks. However, I find their assessment that this scenario has a 1 in 10 chance of occurring to be slightly too high. The reasoning from Forecaster 2 strongly reinforces my initial assessment and conclusion.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, my forecast remains unchanged. The deliberation confirmed that the core thesis is sound: for Mahmoud Khalil to be deported by July 1, 2025, his active legal challenge must reach a final, unappealable conclusion, and then immigration authorities must logistically execute his removal, all within approximately 45 days. The arguments from the other forecasters reinforced that the base rate for such a rapid sequence of events in the US system is extremely low. I considered Forecaster 3's argument for a 10% probability, which correctly notes that the system is *capable* of unusual speed. However, I conclude that overcoming the dual hurdles—first a rapid judicial finality and second a rapid administrative execution—in this specific timeframe makes the event less likely than 1-in-10. My initial 5% forecast was intended to capture this as a rare but not impossible event, and I believe it remains the more accurate calibration of this low-probability outcome.",
