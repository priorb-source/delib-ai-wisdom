    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 3's identification of specific failure modes is particularly valuable - especially the dual-acknowledgment requirement and the risk that communications might flow through envoys or multi-party calls during sensitive negotiations. The May 10 call included European leaders, which suggests future coordination might also be structured as group calls rather than bilateral. Forecaster 2 makes a good point about in-person attendance potentially reducing the need for calls, though Trump's busy schedule and the 33-day window still favor at least one call occurring. All three forecasts cluster in the 70-78% range, suggesting reasonable convergence on the probability despite slightly different emphasis on various factors.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 78% to 74%. The dual-acknowledgment requirement is stricter than I initially weighted - both sides must publicly confirm the call occurred. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that during sensitive negotiations, leaders often use intermediaries or structure calls as multi-party rather than bilateral, which could prevent the resolution criteria from being met even if Trump and Zelenskyy coordinate. The May 10 joint call with European leaders suggests this pattern may continue. However, I'm not going as low as 70% because: (1) the established pattern of frequent, bilaterally-acknowledged calls in 2025 is strong (three times in three months), (2) the 33-day window is generous - even if Istanbul happens without a coordinating call, there's still a full month afterward, (3) the critical nature of ongoing peace negotiations makes complete silence unlikely, and (4) both leaders have demonstrated willingness to communicate directly and acknowledge such calls publicly. The combination of strong precedent and extended timeframe outweighs the identified failure modes, but not by as much as my initial forecast suggested.",
