    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the massive base-rate hurdle (31-seat deficit, Lib Dems never largest in the unitary era) and the unusually favorable national backdrop for an upset (Tory collapse, Reform vote-splitting, LD organizational strength). Forecaster 2’s framing of a “perfect storm” aligns with my earlier view and lands near my prior estimate. Forecaster 3 adds one nuance I didn’t explicitly foreground: Reform UK may capture some seats themselves, not just split the Tory vote. That would reduce Conservative seats but doesn’t necessarily help the Lib Dems become the largest party, since those seats don’t accrue to the Lib Dems. I agree with both that fragmentation (Independents, Labour, Greens, Reform) is a key headwind for an LD plurality.\n\nNeither added Cornwall-specific data (polling, candidate slates by division, retirements beyond the leader) that would materially shift my priors. I find F3’s 18% somewhat low given Lib Dem parliamentary momentum locally and strong targeting capacity; I find F2’s 30% reasonable upper bound absent local polling showing LD ahead. The Reform-winning-seats point mildly lowers the upside but not enough to move me out of my prior range.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Conservatives 44; Lib Dems 13; Independents likely mid-20s; others small. For a Lib Dem plurality, several things must align: (1) a sharp Conservative seat drop; (2) Reform mostly hurting Tories without converting too many wards into Reform holds; (3) strong LD targeting converting three- and four-way splits into narrow LD wins; and (4) Independents and Labour not disproportionately siphoning anti-Tory gains in LD target areas.\n\nAssessment of these conditions:\n- Conservative decline is very plausible given national polling and local retirements, but they can remain largest on a reduced total if opposition gains are dispersed.\n- Reform’s presence is a double-edged sword: it helps LDs via splits but could also take some seats directly, which doesn’t help LDs top the table.\n- LDs have credible local capacity (recent Westminster gains in North Cornwall and St Ives; near-full slate; targeted campaigning), which supports meaningful gains from 13 seats.\n- Independents’ structural strength in Cornwall remains the biggest impediment to an LD plurality; even with Tory losses, Independents and Labour could capture enough of the anti-Tory vote to keep LDs second or third.\n\nNet: A Lib Dem plurality is a live but still underdog outcome. Forecaster 3’s point about Reform potentially winning seats slightly tempers the upside, but absent Cornwall-specific polling indicating LDs leading on vote share or seat projections, I keep my estimate within my prior range.\n\nI would move up with credible Cornwall polls showing LD ahead in vote share and/or strong ward-level canvass data implying broad LD overperformance in Tory-held divisions. I would move down with evidence that Independents/Labour are surging in LD target wards or that Reform is fielding strong local candidates likely to win multiple divisions outright.",
