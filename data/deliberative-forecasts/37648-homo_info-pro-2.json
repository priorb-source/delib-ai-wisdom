    "review": "My initial forecast was based on a research report indicating a diplomatic stalemate and maximalist, non-negotiable U.S. demands, making a deal seem nearly impossible. The other two forecasters clearly had access to a different, and contradictory, set of facts which I must now incorporate. Their reports of active negotiations, a specific major concession from Iran (eliminating its highly enriched uranium stockpile), and an imminent deadline set by President Trump fundamentally alter the situation. Forecaster 3's argument that the deadline acts as a powerful forcing function, creating a 'now or never' dynamic, is particularly compelling. Forecaster 2's focus on the substantive Iranian concession provides evidence that the talks are not just procedural but are making real progress on core issues. Their reasoning is convincing because it is based on strong, positive signals that directly contradict the premise of my original forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast from 5% to 60%. My previous analysis is now obsolete due to the new information presented by my colleagues. The basis for my forecast has shifted from a near-certain 'No' to a 'more likely than not Yes'. The key drivers for this substantial change are: 1) The Presidential Deadline: A hard two-month deadline expiring in the next few weeks reframes the short timeline from an obstacle into a catalyst, creating immense pressure to finalize an agreement. 2) Substantive Iranian Concessions: The reported willingness to eliminate the highly enriched uranium stockpile is a massive breakthrough, suggesting the primary technical and political hurdles are being overcome. 3) Converging Signals: The combination of sustained diplomatic talks, positive rhetoric, and external validation from a skeptical party (Israeli intelligence) creates a powerful, consistent narrative of progress toward a deal. I am not updating higher than 60% because complex negotiations between adversaries are inherently fragile. The risk of a last-minute collapse due to domestic political opposition in either Washington or Tehran, or intractable disagreements over verification details, remains substantial.",
