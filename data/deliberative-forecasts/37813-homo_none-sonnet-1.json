    "review": "All three analyses converge on the key evidence (December 2024's 6 cube sightings described as 'rare') and recognize the low threshold (only 1 sighting needed). However, there's disagreement on how to interpret 'rare.' Forecaster 2 (55%) takes a more conservative view that many months likely have zero cube reports. Forecaster 3 (65%) takes a middle position. My original 70% may have been too optimistic. The critical insight I'm now focusing on is the ambiguity in the word 'rare' - it could mean either (A) having 6 cube sightings in one month is rare, or (B) cube sightings in general are rare in NUFORC's history. If interpretation (B) is correct, then many months might have zero cube-shaped reports, which would make the probability lower than I initially thought. None of us have monthly baseline data on cube-shaped sightings, which is the fundamental uncertainty driving our different forecasts.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 70% was slightly too confident given the significant uncertainty about base rates. The phrase 'rare in the history of NUFORC' could indicate that cube-shaped sightings are genuinely uncommon across months, not just that December's count of 6 was unusual. While the low threshold (only 1 sighting needed) works in favor of Yes, and December's 6 reports demonstrate these sightings do occur, the conservative interpretation suggests a meaningful probability that June 2025 could have zero cube-shaped reports. Forecaster 2's concern that many months might have zero cube reports is well-taken. However, I don't want to be as conservative as 55% given that we have recent concrete evidence of cube reports occurring and being posted. I'm updating downward to account for greater uncertainty about whether typical months include at least one cube report, settling between Forecasters 2 and 3's estimates.",
