    "review": "Both forecasters raise important considerations I need to weigh carefully. Forecaster 2's point about front-loading is compelling - exporters often accelerate shipments before tariffs take full effect, which could temporarily boost April numbers. This is a real phenomenon I underweighted. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 2018-2019 trade war precedent showing flat or declining exports is sobering, though I note those were still often positive in nominal terms due to inflation. However, both forecasters may be overestimating the probability of an actual year-over-year nominal decline. The key insight is that the threshold requires only ANY increase - even $1 million more than $262,578M resolves as Yes. Historically, nominal year-over-year declines in US exports are quite rare outside major recessions, occurring in perhaps 20-30% of months even during trade war periods. Both forecasters at 35-40% seem to be implicitly forecasting a higher probability of actual nominal decline than historical base rates would suggest. That said, their concerns about timing, retaliation severity, and trade war headwinds are valid and create substantial uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm moderating my forecast downward but not as dramatically as the other forecasters. The critical factors: (1) The threshold is extremely low - requiring only minimal nominal growth, where even 1% would suffice. (2) Historical base rates show nominal year-over-year export declines are unusual outside recessions, occurring perhaps 25-35% of the time during trade war periods. (3) Inflation (currently 2-3% annually) provides a baseline lift of roughly $5-8 billion. (4) The timing argument is important - if tariffs were announced in early 2025, April may capture front-loading effects or be too early for full retaliatory impact. Against this: (1) The 'liberation day' tariffs reference suggests significant trade policy disruption. (2) Swift retaliation from major partners could suppress exports. (3) 2018-2019 showed trade wars can overcome inflation effects in some months. The forecasters are right to emphasize downside risks, but I believe they're underweighting how high the bar actually is for a No resolution - it requires nominal exports to be flat or DOWN year-over-year, which remains relatively unlikely even in adverse conditions. I'm adjusting to 52% to reflect greater uncertainty about tariff impacts while maintaining that the low threshold slightly favors Yes.",
