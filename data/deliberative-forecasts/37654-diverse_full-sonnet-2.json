    "review": "All three analyses converge strongly on the core factors: a 46-day window, historical timelines of 2-6 months for executive reorganizations, high completion bar requiring formal signed action, and unfavorable base rate of 12% completion. Forecaster 2's reasoning closely mirrors mine at 15%. Forecaster 3's lower forecast of 9% raises a compelling point I underweighted: the legally fraught nature of breaking up a major federal agency means that for an EO to be signed by late June, it would need to be substantially complete NOW in mid-May, and we have no evidence of drafts, vetting completion, or imminent action. The absence of leaks or preparatory signals at this point is more telling than I initially credited. However, Forecaster 3 acknowledges that a late-June EO remains possible, and the genuine momentum demonstrated by concrete actions (database discontinued, not just proposed) suggests this is a live priority. The question is whether skepticism about an imminent EO should push the forecast from 15% to 9%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward from 15% to 12%. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the legal complexity and the point that an EO would need to be 'already far along' by now is persuasive. We're 46 days out with no concrete signals of an imminent executive order - no leaked drafts, no reports of completed vetting, no scheduling signals. For a major agency restructuring, this absence of evidence is meaningful. The 'legally fraught' characterization is apt: this isn't a simple policy directive but a complex reorganization that requires extensive legal review. However, I'm not dropping to 9% because: (1) there IS demonstrated intent through concrete actions already taken, not just rhetoric; (2) executive orders CAN occasionally move faster than typical when highly prioritized; (3) the administration has shown willingness to use executive power aggressively; and (4) we cannot rule out that an EO is in advanced development without public signals. The 12% forecast reflects increased skepticism about imminent action while maintaining meaningful probability for a late-June surprise.",
