  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until end of day on June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — absent a fresh capital infusion or asset sale, the company is likely to run out of liquidity and seek U.S. bankruptcy protection before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures a small bridge financing, executes an asset sale, or receives a strategic investment that extends runway past July 1; alternatively, it winds down operations or pursues a non-U.S./non-bankruptcy process (e.g., Canadian proceedings or an assignment for the benefit of creditors) without filing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity is exhausted or near-exhausted, negotiations for financing fail, and the board opts to file for Chapter 11 (or Chapter 7) in the U.S. to preserve value, address lease/vendor liabilities, or conduct a 363 sale, doing so before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the assistant’s report: cash fell from $9.2m (end-2023) to $0.23m (12/31/2024); FY24 revenue only $0.79m (down 68% YoY); GAAP EPS -$29.47; management issued a going-concern warning; former CFO said, “We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations.” Debt-to-equity is low (0.05), implying limited secured creditor pressure.\n\nReasoning: With such minimal cash at year-end and a stated lack of sufficient liquidity, the default (status quo) trajectory is a near-term cash crisis leading to a bankruptcy filing to manage liabilities and possibly run a sale process. The March 27, 2025 update suggests urgency; lacking financing, companies in this position often file within weeks. The short time window left (roughly two months) keeps the probability elevated.\n\nWhy not higher: Several realistic off-ramps could push any filing beyond July 1. These include: a small bridge financing or toxic convertible raise; an asset sale that brings in a few million of liquidity; vendor deferrals; or a non-bankruptcy pathway (e.g., Canadian proceedings or an out-of-court wind-down/assignment), none of which would satisfy this question’s U.S. bankruptcy trigger. Low leverage also reduces immediate creditor-driven pressure to file, and if the company has managed to avoid filing through early May, it suggests some interim support may exist.\n\nWhy not lower: The cash position disclosed was critically low; revenue has deteriorated; management explicitly flagged insufficiency of liquidity and going concern. Without timely capital, payroll, lease, and vendor obligations typically force a filing. Given the March 27 warning, the most natural course absent fresh funds is a U.S. bankruptcy filing before July 1.\n\nWhat would move me down: A disclosed financing (even a few million), a signed asset sale with near-term cash proceeds, evidence of extended runway (e.g., meaningful cost cuts and vendor concessions), or credible strategic investment announcements.\n\nWhat would move me up: News of failed financing efforts, missed payments or payroll, mounting litigation or eviction actions, retention of restructuring advisors/law firms for a formal process, or any indication of imminent liquidity exhaustion without alternatives.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease.

The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
