  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, no official announcement confirming attendance has been made by the Uruguayan government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government either decides not to attend due to geopolitical considerations or domestic political debate, or simply fails to issue an official public confirmation before the July 1, 2025 deadline, even if the private intention is to attend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the coming weeks, the office of the President of Uruguay or its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a press release or makes a public statement confirming that President Yamandú Orsi has accepted the invitation and will attend the BRICS summit in July.",
    "rationale": "The basis for this high-confidence forecast is the strong positive signaling from both parties involved. The invitation was extended publicly by Brazilian President Lula da Silva, the leader of Uruguay's most important neighbor and a key regional ally. President Yamandú Orsi immediately responded with public interest, framing potential attendance as an opportunity to promote 'multilateralism and free trade,' which are core tenets of Uruguay's established foreign policy. Accepting this invitation aligns with Uruguay's strategic goal of diversifying its international partnerships beyond traditional blocs. The diplomatic cost of refusing the invitation after expressing interest would be significant, particularly for the new administration's relationship with Brazil. The primary driver of the forecast is that the political and diplomatic incentives are heavily weighted towards acceptance and announcement.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is a small but non-trivial chance that internal deliberations within Orsi's new government, or external diplomatic pressure from partners wary of BRICS, could cause a delay or reversal. Furthermore, simple administrative inertia could cause an announcement to be postponed beyond the resolution date of July 1st.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the initial public statements from President Orsi create a strong expectation of attendance. A failure to follow through would be a noteworthy diplomatic snub to Brazil and would contradict the president's stated foreign policy aims. Given the summit is in July, a formal announcement in June is a standard and highly probable diplomatic procedure.\n\nI would raise my probability closer to 100% upon hearing further corroborating statements from Uruguayan officials or credible media reports about travel preparations. Conversely, I would lower the probability if credible reports emerge of significant US pressure against attendance, notable domestic political opposition, or if the end of June approaches with continued official silence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
