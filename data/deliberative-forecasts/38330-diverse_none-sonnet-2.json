    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the EXACT phrase requirement is particularly compelling - the resolution requires 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase' specifically, not variations like 'reverse consumption' or descriptive alternatives. This is far more restrictive than I initially considered. Forecaster 2's confirmation that current searches show ZERO historical usage by NYT is powerful baseline evidence. Both correctly emphasize NYT's editorial practices of avoiding direct calques from Chinese state media jargon - they would likely describe the phenomenon in their own language even if covering it. Forecaster 3's point about alternative financial terminology ('reverse repurchase' not 'reverse purchase') further narrows the probability space. The convergence of their forecasts (3-5%) versus my 7% suggests I was too optimistic about the likelihood of this exact phrase appearing.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly underweighted the restrictiveness of the exact-phrase requirement. Even if NYT covers Chinese consumer trends or thrift culture within the 21-day window, they would almost certainly use their own descriptive language rather than adopt 'reverse purchasing' verbatim from People's Daily. The zero historical precedent for these exact phrases in NYT archives is strong evidence against sudden adoption. NYT style conventions favor clarity and established terminology over niche translated jargon. The only realistic pathways are: (1) direct quotation of Chinese sources using the term, or (2) an unlikely finance/accounting context using 'reverse purchase.' Both scenarios remain possible but highly improbable within such a narrow window. My original 7% failed to properly account for the compounding unlikelihood of: exact phrase match + novel terminology + short timeframe + editorial barriers. The 3-5% range from other forecasters better reflects these constraints.",
