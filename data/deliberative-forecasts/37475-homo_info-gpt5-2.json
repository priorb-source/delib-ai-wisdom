    "review": "Both forecasters add useful specifics I hadn’t explicitly cited: this is Class I, a single production date (Feb 5, 2025), ~22,672 lbs, distribution to ~10 states, and only two complaints with no injuries. Forecaster 2’s point about single-day scope and Johnsonville’s experience pushing toward a 6–12 week closure is persuasive. I also find the caution about seasonal grilling potentially surfacing additional complaints, and the risk of administrative lag in FSIS status updates near the deadline, to be valid reasons to keep probability below the mid-70s. Forecaster 3’s mixed base rates (Johnsonville often 4–8 weeks vs broader foreign-material recalls sometimes 2–4 months) match my priors. Overall, their arguments slightly strengthen the case for closure within the window due to the constrained lot and lack of injuries, while keeping meaningful tail risk from expansion, multi-state effectiveness checks, and page-update timing.",
    "rationale": "We have ~52 days until July 1, giving a total window of ~87 days from the April 5 posting. For a Class I, single-lot, moderate-size recall by an experienced firm, historical closure times often fall within 6–12 weeks once effectiveness checks and corrective actions are verified. The single production date, modest scope (~22.7k lbs), no injuries, and only two complaints suggest tractable root cause and verification. These factors increase the likelihood of closure by late June. Countervailing risks remain: multi-state retail checks can drag, foreign-material recalls sometimes expand if new complaints emerge (especially with increased product usage in late spring), and even if operationally complete on June 30, an FSIS update lag could leave the page Active on July 1, which would resolve No under the criterion. Balancing these, I nudge my estimate slightly upward on the added specifics about the recall’s constrained scope and Johnsonville’s track record, but keep a nontrivial tail for expansion/lag. I move from 68% to 69%.",
