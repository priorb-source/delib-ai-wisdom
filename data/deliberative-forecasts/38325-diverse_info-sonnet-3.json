    "review": "The other forecasters provide crucial new information I lacked: the second estimate is now available at -0.2%, representing a +0.1 pp positive revision from the advance estimate of -0.3%. This fundamentally changes the analytical landscape. Forecaster 2's insight about the -4.90 pp drag from net imports is particularly valuable—this extreme figure creates a plausible mechanism for large revisions as more complete March trade data becomes available. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that we now need a +0.3 pp upward revision from the second estimate to flip positive, and importantly notes that exactly 0.0% would still resolve as No. Both forecasters appropriately recognize that second-to-third revisions are typically smaller (0.1-0.2 pp) than advance-to-third revisions, which complicates the path to a positive reading. Their forecasts cluster tightly at 35-40%, suggesting convergence on the probability space.",
    "rationale": "I must update my analysis given the second estimate data. While my original 37% forecast was anchored to historical rates for advance estimates between -0.5% and 0% flipping positive (35-40%), the second estimate changes the calculus in two opposing ways. Favorably: we're now closer to zero (-0.2% vs -0.3%), and the positive revision direction suggests data is improving. Unfavorably: we now need a +0.3 pp revision from second to third, which exceeds the typical 0.1-0.2 pp magnitude for that specific revision stage. If the pattern continues at +0.1 pp, we'd reach -0.1%, still negative. However, Forecaster 2's observation about trade component volatility prevents a larger downward revision—the -4.90 pp net import drag is anomalous enough that meaningful corrections remain plausible as comprehensive March trade data arrives. The tight clustering of forecasts at 34-40% appears well-calibrated. I'm revising slightly downward from 37% to 34%, reflecting that we now specifically need a larger-than-average second-to-third revision rather than relying on the broader advance-to-third historical pattern.",
