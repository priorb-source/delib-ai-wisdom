    "review": "The other forecasters raised several critical pieces of evidence I had not fully weighted: (1) Chegg maintains a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars with positive free cash flow - this is decisive evidence against imminent bankruptcy; (2) No large debt maturities before 2026, eliminating the most common bankruptcy trigger; (3) Active pursuit of strategic alternatives including privatization/acquisition; (4) Recent litigation against Google demonstrating resources and fighting posture rather than capitulation. These are objective facts that fundamentally alter the probability calculation. Both forecasters correctly distinguished between long-term existential business model risk (which is real and severe) versus imminent bankruptcy within 57 days (which is highly implausible). Their base rate reasoning is compelling - companies with substantial cash reserves, positive FCF, and no near-term debt obligations simply don't file for bankruptcy within 2-month windows absent extraordinary circumstances like massive fraud or hidden liabilities, for which we have no evidence. The NYSE non-compliance and stock price collapse that concerned me reflect market pessimism about long-term viability, not indicators of immediate insolvency.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast significantly downward from 8% to 4%. The other forecasters' arguments about Chegg's cash position and lack of near-term debt obligations are compelling and should have been weighted more heavily in my initial analysis. The distinction between structural business model challenges (severe, but longer-term) and imminent bankruptcy risk (requires acute liquidity crisis) is critical here. With several hundred million in cash, positive free cash flow, no debt maturities until 2026, and active strategic alternatives being pursued, the probability of bankruptcy filing within 57 days is very low. I'm maintaining 4% rather than dropping to 3% because: (1) we lack perfect visibility into all covenant structures and potential hidden liabilities; (2) the Q1 results on May 12 could theoretically reveal catastrophic undisclosed issues; (3) the WSJ article's framing and stock collapse suggest possible factors beyond our current information. However, the base case strongly supports continued operations through July 1, 2025.",
