  "information": "Several states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025, and today is May 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page currently and explicitly lists 'snack foods' as an eligible item category.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In response to growing pressure from states seeking waivers and heightened public debate about nutrition, the USDA makes a quick, cosmetic update to its website to de-emphasize the eligibility of items perceived as unhealthy. A politically appointed official directs the web team to remove the specific phrase 'snack foods' as a simple way to address criticism without a formal change in law or regulation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia prevails over the short timeframe. The process for changing official government guidance, even on a website, moves slowly. The state-level waiver requests are treated as exceptions to the national standard, and the federal guidance page reflecting that standard remains unchanged. No new federal policy or executive order compelling a change is issued and implemented before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My high probability forecast is primarily driven by bureaucratic inertia. The resolution date is only six weeks away, a very short period for a federal agency to amend official public guidance that reflects established law. The status quo is that 'snack foods' are listed, and the path of least resistance is to leave the page unchanged. The research provided, which highlights states seeking waivers to restrict items like soda and candy, actually reinforces the 'Yes' case. The waiver system exists for states to deviate from the federal standard, meaning the federal standard itself (which the website describes) remains broad. Changing the national guidance page because of a few state-level exceptions would be inconsistent. While there is political pressure to restrict certain SNAP purchases, enacting a federal policy change or even a consensus-driven wording change on a website within this timeframe is highly improbable. My forecast is not higher because there is a small but non-zero chance of a rapid, top-down directive to make a cosmetic change to the website's language for political or public relations reasons. Such a minor text edit could bypass the usual lengthy process if mandated by a senior official. The forecast is not lower because there are no signs of an impending, formal federal policy shift. This would require significant legislative or administrative action, which is not on the immediate horizon. I would lower my forecast if the USDA or the White House announced a new initiative or review of SNAP eligibility for 'foods of minimal nutritional value'. I would raise my forecast if USDA officials made public statements reaffirming the current broad definition of eligible foods.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026.

Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
