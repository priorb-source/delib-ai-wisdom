    "review": "The other two forecasters are heavily anchored on pre-April 2025 data, such as positive year-over-year trends from March and high absolute export levels in February. They treat the implementation of sweeping tariffs on April 2 as a future uncertainty or a modest risk, rather than a structural break for which we already have negative leading indicators for the month of April. Forecaster 2 states they \"lack April data\", which is incorrect, as the research assistant's report explicitly provides April data points (a 45% YoY drop in China-US shipping bookings and contracting manufacturing PMI). Forecaster 3 argues that exports do not typically plunge \"absent a clear shock,\" failing to recognize that a multi-nation trade war, as described, is precisely such a shock. Their reasoning appears to underweight the most salient and timely information provided, making their high-probability forecasts unconvincing.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%, heavily influenced by the research assistant's report of a trade war beginning in early April. The deliberation with other forecasters has strengthened my conviction and led me to lower my forecast. The other forecasters' focus on March data is illuminating, but not in the way they intended. Forecaster 2's analysis suggests March 2025 total exports were likely in the $250-265B range, which is very close to — and potentially already below — the April 2024 threshold of $262.6B. This indicates that any positive year-over-year momentum from earlier in the quarter had already stalled *before* the tariffs hit. Layering a major trade shock on top of this already flat-to-down performance makes a year-over-year increase in April highly improbable. The combination of (1) retaliatory tariffs from multiple countries, (2) a confirmed 45% YoY drop in shipping bookings with a major partner (China), and (3) contracting manufacturing PMI for April constitutes overwhelming evidence for a 'No' outcome. The pre-shock trend is irrelevant after a structural break of this magnitude. I am therefore more confident in my initial reasoning and am decreasing my probability for a 'Yes' outcome.",
