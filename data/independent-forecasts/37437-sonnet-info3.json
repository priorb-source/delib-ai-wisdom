  "information": "Broader geopolitical factors include Japan's decision to undertake its largest military expansion since World War II, with the goal of doubling its defense budget by 2027, partly in response to the perceived Chinese threat to Taiwan. The U.S. and Japan have conducted joint military exercises on Japanese islands near Taiwan. Economically, a report in The Economist suggested the U.S.-China trade war could influence events, though some scholars believe China's internal economic situation makes military action less likely. The Council on Foreign Relations has assessed a security crisis in the Taiwan Strait as 'moderately likely' in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - China does not invade Taiwan and the US makes no such accusation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its current pattern of military exercises, rhetoric, and pressure around Taiwan without launching an actual ground invasion. Tensions remain elevated but no major military action occurs in the remaining two months. The status quo of strategic ambiguity and deterrence holds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China launches a surprise ground invasion of Taiwan with military forces entering Taiwan without the Taiwanese government's consent. The invasion could be a full-scale amphibious assault or a more limited operation (such as seizing outlying islands). The US government publicly and explicitly accuses China of invading Taiwan through official government channels.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome given the extremely short timeframe and absence of indicators suggesting imminent action. Several factors support a low probability: (1) Historical base rate - China has not invaded Taiwan in 75+ years despite ongoing tensions; (2) Time constraint - only ~2 months remain, and major amphibious invasions require extensive visible preparations that intelligence agencies would detect; (3) The research assistant notes China's internal economic situation makes military action less likely; (4) Economic and military costs of such action would be enormous for China. However, the probability is not zero because: (1) CFR assessed a security crisis as 'moderately likely' in 2025, indicating expert concern; (2) Japan's unprecedented post-WWII military expansion and US-Japan joint exercises near Taiwan suggest real perceived risk; (3) The question only requires a US accusation, which could result from even a limited Chinese military incursion; (4) Geopolitical black swan events do occur. The forecast would increase with reports of unusual Chinese military mobilization, naval movements toward Taiwan, or intelligence warnings. It would decrease with improved diplomatic engagement or clear evidence China is focused on domestic economic issues. Given the strong status quo bias, short timeframe, and lack of imminent threat indicators, a probability in the low single digits is appropriate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBroader geopolitical factors include Japan's decision to undertake its largest military expansion since World War II, with the goal of doubling its defense budget by 2027, partly in response to the perceived Chinese threat to Taiwan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
