    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no announcement has been made yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord delays its IPO plans due to unfavorable market conditions, internal preparation needs, or strategic considerations. The company continues operating privately and does not file an S-1 or make an official announcement on its blog before the July 1 deadline, even if it still intends to pursue an IPO later in 2025 or beyond.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord proceeds with its reported 2025 IPO timeline and files an SEC Form S-1 or publishes a specific announcement on its official blog stating clear intent to pursue an initial public offering. The announcement comes in June 2025 as the company finalizes preparations with its investment banking partners.",
    "rationale": "The March 2025 Ars Technica report provides credible evidence that Discord is actively planning an IPO, including partnerships with major investment banks (JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs). This is a strong signal that preparation is underway. However, we are now in late May - over two months past that report - and no official announcement has materialized yet. This delay is concerning for a YES outcome. The status quo strongly favors NO since no announcement exists currently, and corporate announcements that haven't happened yet tend not to happen (status quo bias). That said, 39 days remains meaningful time for an announcement if plans are truly in motion. Companies often time IPO announcements strategically, and Discord may be waiting for optimal market conditions or internal readiness. The key tension is between: (1) credible reporting of concrete IPO plans and banking partnerships suggesting real momentum, versus (2) the passage of time without announcement and the historical tendency for IPO timelines to slip. My forecast is not higher (60-70%) because no announcement has occurred despite ample time passing, and IPO plans frequently get delayed or modified. It's not lower (20-25%) because the March report was specific and credible, and 39 days provides sufficient runway for an announcement if preparations are advanced. I would revise upward if any preparatory signals emerged (executive hires, regulatory filings, additional media reports), and downward if June passes without activity or if market conditions deteriorate significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
