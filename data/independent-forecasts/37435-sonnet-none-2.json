    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg continues operating without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg manages to avoid bankruptcy through a combination of cost-cutting measures, securing bridge financing, restructuring existing debt, or selling non-core assets. While the company may be struggling financially due to AI competition, it maintains enough liquidity and creditor support to stay solvent through July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg faces an acute liquidity crisis in the coming weeks. Unable to meet near-term debt obligations or payroll, and unable to secure emergency financing, the company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure its debts and operations while being severely impacted by ChatGPT and other AI competitors eating into its core business.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe is crucial here - only 57 days until resolution. Bankruptcy filings by publicly traded companies are typically preceded by extended periods of financial distress, not sudden filings. Even companies facing severe business model disruption usually have multiple options before bankruptcy: negotiating with creditors, asset sales, equity raises (even heavily diluted), debt restructuring, or operational changes. The WSJ article confirms Chegg has been significantly impacted by AI competition, which is a real long-term concern for their homework help business model. However, facing business model challenges is different from facing immediate insolvency. Without specific information about Chegg's current cash position, upcoming debt maturities, or covenant violations in the next two months, I must weight heavily toward the status quo - continued operation. Companies generally avoid bankruptcy as long as possible due to the costs, stigma, and loss of control. The research assistant provided no indication of imminent financial crisis. My forecast is not higher because 2 months is an extremely short window for a public company to go from operation to bankruptcy filing absent a sudden shock. It's not lower because: (1) we lack detailed current financial data, (2) AI disruption to Chegg's model is real and documented, and (3) unexpected liquidity crises, while rare, can occur. To move higher, I'd need evidence of: immediate cash shortfalls, recent debt covenant violations, failed financing attempts, or creditor demands. To move lower, I'd need recent financial statements showing adequate liquidity through Q3 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
