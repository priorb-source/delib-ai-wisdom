    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remaining until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if no major catalyzing events occur, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The next two months pass without any major triggering events (controversial Supreme Court decisions, high-profile incidents, major policy announcements, etc.) that would mobilize 10,000+ protesters in a single location. Existing political tensions remain at current levels without significant escalation. Any protests that do occur remain below the 10,000 participant threshold or are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant catalyzing event occurs in May or June 2025 - such as a controversial Supreme Court ruling, major federal policy change, high-profile police incident, or other socially/politically charged event. This triggers rapid mobilization through social media and activist networks, resulting in at least one protest with 10,000+ participants that is documented by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Large-scale protests (10,000+ participants) in the US are episodic rather than constant - they typically require specific triggering events and mobilization efforts. While the US has seen numerous massive protests in recent years (George Floyd protests in 2020, Women's March in 2017, various climate and political protests), they cluster around particular catalyzing moments rather than occurring regularly. The 2-month timeframe is relatively short, reducing the probability that such an event will occur. However, several factors keep the probability meaningful: (1) We're in a politically charged environment, (2) Summer approaches when protests are more common due to weather and schedule factors, (3) Various contentious issues exist (immigration, reproductive rights, climate policy), and (4) The US has demonstrated capacity for rapid large-scale mobilization when triggering events occur. My forecast isn't higher because there are no known specific planned major events or recent triggering incidents, and the 10,000+ threshold is substantial - not all protests reach this scale even when contentious issues arise. My forecast isn't lower because historical base rates suggest several such protests occur annually in the US, and 2 months represents roughly 1/6 of a year. I would update higher if: a major controversial event occurs, specific large protests are announced, or political tensions escalate significantly. I would update lower if: the next few weeks pass quietly without triggering events, planned events are cancelled, or mobilization efforts appear weak.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
