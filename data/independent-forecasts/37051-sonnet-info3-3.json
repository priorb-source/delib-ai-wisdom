  "information": "Legal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS follows normal procedures which require a multi-year process including audit, formal notice, appeals, and potential litigation. Even if revocation proceedings begin, the timeline extends well beyond July 1, 2025. Legal challenges and statutory safeguards further delay any action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration successfully fast-tracks an unprecedented expedited revocation process, potentially through emergency executive action or novel legal interpretation. The IRS issues formal revocation before July 1, 2025, either bypassing normal procedures or completing them in an extraordinarily compressed timeframe.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Harvard maintaining its tax-exempt status. My research assistant's report highlights that the normal revocation process takes years and involves multiple procedural steps including audits, formal notices, appeals, and litigation. With only 67 days until the deadline, completing this process would be extraordinarily difficult even under ideal conditions. The legal framework includes specific safeguards (IRC § 7217 and the 1998 anti-targeting law) designed to prevent politically motivated revocations and direct presidential interference. The IRS is also experiencing severe internal challenges with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions, which significantly undermines its capacity for rapid, complex action. However, I cannot assign a probability near zero because the Trump administration has formally requested revocation proceedings and the IRS is reportedly 'making plans.' This represents unprecedented political pressure and some level of institutional movement. While such an action would be legally and procedurally extraordinary, we've seen other unprecedented executive actions in various contexts. For my forecast to move significantly higher, I would need evidence of: (1) formal revocation notices actually issued, (2) a novel expedited legal process being implemented, or (3) court rulings enabling rapid action. For it to move lower, I would need clear evidence that normal multi-year procedures must be followed or that legal obstacles have been erected that extend beyond July 1. Given the overwhelming procedural barriers, limited timeline, IRS capacity constraints, and legal safeguards, but acknowledging the active political pressure, I forecast a 5% probability of Yes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University lose its tax exempt status before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump Threatens Harvard’s Tax Status, Escalating Billion-Dollar Pressure Campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
