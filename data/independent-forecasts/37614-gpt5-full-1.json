  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8–9 days (election day is May 20, 2025; unofficial results likely May 20–21).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Metz is recalled and does not retain his seat.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mail ballots continue to skew toward recall as controversy over the shooting dominates local sentiment in a very small electorate; turnout among signers/supporters of the recall is high, and undecided or low-information voters default to removing a councilor facing felony charges. With ballots already out, late developments don’t materially shift perceptions, and the typical majority-for-recall pattern holds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Metz’s supporters successfully frame the recall as premature before his criminal case is resolved, mobilize allies through door-to-door outreach, and benefit from low turnout among recall backers. Personal relationships in the small town plus a late pro-Metz push (letters, endorsements, neighborhood networks) narrow the margin enough for a narrow “retain” vote.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: (1) Metz faces serious felony charges after allegedly shooting a 17-year-old in the face; he pleaded not guilty and took a leave from the council. (2) A recall election is set for May 20, 2025; ballots were mailed in late April in this small, mail-in electorate (<400 active voters). (3) No public polling exists. (4) Historically, around 60% of local recalls that reach the ballot succeed; several recent Colorado small-town recalls have succeeded, indicating a supportive environment for removal. \nWeighting the evidence: The base rate already favors removal. The alleged misconduct is severe and highly salient, which likely increases the removal probability above the generic base rate. In a very small electorate, community norms and personal ties matter, but so does negative media attention; the case has drawn prominent local coverage emphasizing that investigators saw no criminal intent by the teen. With ballots already out and many likely returned, late-breaking persuasion has limited runway. \nWhy not higher (closer to certain recall)? Small electorates are volatile; a few dozen votes can swing the outcome. Personal relationships, due-process framing, and effective GOTV by Metz’s allies could outperform expectations. There is no polling, so uncertainty is elevated. \nWhy not lower (closer to a coin flip)? The combination of a serious criminal allegation, sustained media scrutiny, and the general recall success rate suggest a structural headwind for Metz. Recent Colorado examples show voters willing to remove local officials when controversies arise. \nWhat would move me upward (toward retain): credible signs of strong pro-Metz mobilization (high-proportion returns from his precinct base), public endorsements from respected local figures, or new exculpatory information that changes the narrative before most ballots are cast. \nWhat would move me downward (toward recall): reports of high ballot return rates town-wide without evidence of a distinct pro-Metz pocket, additional negative coverage or official statements from law enforcement, or indications that recall organizers have a robust GOTV operation. Given timing, the prior (removal favored) carries extra weight.",
