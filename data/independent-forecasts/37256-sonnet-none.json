    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - South Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "South Sudan continues without ratifying AfCFTA due to political instability, limited institutional capacity, competing priorities, and the short timeframe remaining. The government focuses on more immediate concerns like security, delayed elections, and peace agreement implementation rather than regional trade integration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "South Sudan's government, possibly influenced by the World Chambers Africa Summit discussions or regional diplomatic pressure, fast-tracks AfCFTA ratification through an expedited legislative process. The executive branch prioritizes this as a symbolic gesture of regional integration and economic openness, completing the necessary bureaucratic steps within the 2-month window.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. South Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA despite the agreement being operational since 2021, and most African nations having already joined. With only 2 months remaining, ratification would require rapid legislative action in a country facing significant governance challenges including ongoing civil conflict, weak institutional capacity, delayed elections, and economic difficulties. The referenced article about the World Chambers Africa Summit suggests some discussion of economic integration, but discussion does not equal imminent action. My research assistant provided no additional information indicating active ratification proceedings, parliamentary bills, or official government statements about imminent ratification. Historical precedent suggests South Sudan moves slowly on international agreements and regional integration commitments. The probability is not zero because: (1) ratification is technically possible within 2 months if made a priority, (2) there are some discussions happening about economic integration, and (3) regional pressure could theoretically motivate quick action. The probability is not higher because: (1) no concrete evidence of active ratification processes, (2) South Sudan's track record on such commitments is poor, (3) the timeframe is very short for a country with weak institutions, and (4) more pressing domestic priorities likely take precedence. I would update higher with evidence of bills introduced, official ratification timelines announced, or diplomatic reports of active processes. I would update lower if political crises worsen or official rejection statements emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
