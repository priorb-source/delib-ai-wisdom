    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical piece of evidence I had not considered: Hanwha's expectation of orders in 2H 2025. This is highly significant insider information from the manufacturer suggesting the timeline extends past our July 1 deadline. This directly undermines the case for an imminent announcement. Forecaster 2 also makes a strong point about Vietnam's discretion on sensitive arms purchases and the requirement for a government announcement specifically, not just a deal closure. Their heavy weighting of the status quo with only 2 months remaining is methodologically sound. Forecaster 3's claim about January 2025 reports indicating Q1 finalization is concerning - if true, the missed Q1 deadline is a significant negative signal. However, Forecaster 3 maintains 65% despite acknowledging this missed deadline, which seems inconsistent. Their forecast appears to rely too heavily on dated positive reports while underweighting the more recent negative signal of the missed Q1 deadline and the tight remaining timeline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am significantly updating downward. The most compelling new evidence is Hanwha's 2H 2025 guidance, which directly suggests the announcement will come after our July 1 deadline. This is insider information from the supplier that I should weight heavily. Combined with: (1) only 2 months remaining, (2) no announcement despite 6 months since training completion, (3) potential Q1 2025 deadline already missed per Forecaster 3, (4) Vietnam's documented discretion on sensitive arms deals, and (5) first-ever sale complexity requiring extra scrutiny - the path to 'No' (status quo continues without announcement) now appears more likely than 'Yes'. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 22% because the fundamentals remain strong: the deal is real, training occurred, strategic rationale is compelling, and South Korea does publicize exports when permitted. A rapid announcement in May-June, while less likely than I initially thought, remains plausible given the advanced state of negotiations. I'm settling at 38%, down from 58%, reflecting the Hanwha timeline guidance as decisive new evidence while maintaining some probability for an accelerated announcement.",
