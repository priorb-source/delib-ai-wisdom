    "review": "Forecaster 2 largely mirrors my prior take: Morning Consult’s smoothing and the medium‑run pattern (Starmer typically at/above low‑30s; Ishiba high‑20s/low‑30s) support a slight lean to Yes. Forecaster 3 adds useful caution by giving more weight to the purported late‑May MC snapshot showing Ishiba ahead and by emphasizing the tie-as-No penalty. I hadn’t sufficiently priced the combination of (a) a recent possible Ishiba>Starmer ordering and (b) June 11 UK spending review risk that could keep Starmer sub‑30 into late June. Both forecasters correctly frame that big swings are unlikely, so the ordering will probably be decided by small, persistent differentials and recent trend. I find F3’s emphasis on the most recent ordering and the tie penalty convincing enough to shave my confidence, while F2’s reliance on MC’s medium-run baseline still argues for a slight Yes edge.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~1 month until July 1; MC’s 7‑day average means mid/late‑June dynamics will dominate the print used for resolution.\nStatus quo: If the late‑May numbers (Starmer ~28, Ishiba ~32) are indeed Morning Consult, the status quo tilts No and could persist into early July.\nNo scenario: UK headlines around the June 11 spending review/civil service cuts and EU ‘renewal’ criticism keep Starmer at ≤30 while Ishiba stabilizes around 31–33 amid fading scandal noise; tie risk further biases to No.\nYes scenario: Starmer reverts to ~32–34 as UK macro/newsflow is neutral-to-positive (e.g., BoE cut or benign inflation narrative), while Ishiba drifts back to 28–30 as scandal aftereffects and economic concerns (yen, inflation) weigh.\nUpdated view: I still lean Yes on the medium-run MC baseline and Japan’s lower approval ceiling post‑scandal, but I’m trimming my probability given two points raised by the others: (1) the most recent comparative snapshot may already have Ishiba ahead, and (2) ties resolve No. With roughly a month left, the 7‑day average won’t allow a dramatic reversal without real trend change. I’m reducing my forecast from 62% to 56% to reflect the plausible late‑May Ishiba lead and the upcoming June 11 UK risk while maintaining a slight edge for Starmer on mean reversion and historical MC patterns.",
