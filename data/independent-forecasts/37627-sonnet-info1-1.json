  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - they do not speak again during the resolution window",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy do not find it necessary to have another phone call in the next 33 days, either because the May 10 call addressed immediate concerns, peace negotiations stall, they communicate through intermediaries or other channels, or they wait until after June 15 to have their next conversation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Developments in Ukraine peace negotiations or other urgent matters prompt Trump and Zelenskyy to schedule another phone call within the next 33 days. Given the active peace process and the previous pattern of communication, they arrange a follow-up conversation to discuss ceasefire implementation, negotiation details, or new developments.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports that Trump and Zelenskyy most recently spoke on May 10, 2025, discussing peace talks and a potential 30-day ceasefire. Since the resolution period begins AFTER May 12, this call does not count toward a Yes resolution. Looking at their 2025 communication pattern: they spoke on February 12, March 19, and May 10 - gaps of approximately 35 and 52 days. We are now only 3 days past their most recent call. For a Yes outcome, they would need to speak again within the next 33 days (between May 13 and June 14, 2025). The status quo slightly favors No because: (1) they just spoke very recently, reducing immediate need for another call, and (2) their historical pattern suggests calls every 5-7 weeks. However, several factors could push toward Yes: the dynamic peace negotiation situation could require more frequent contact than their historical pattern suggests, and major developments could necessitate urgent communication. The forecast is not higher because they literally just spoke 3 days ago, and typically there would be time to digest outcomes before the next call. The forecast is not lower because the situation is highly fluid with active peace negotiations, and 33 days is long enough that another call remains plausible given their pattern. I would revise upward if reports emerge of scheduled talks or escalating urgency in negotiations, and downward if peace talks stall or if they meet in person instead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
