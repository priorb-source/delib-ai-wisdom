    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points that warrant consideration. Forecaster 2 provides a crucial timing detail - we're 12 days out from the event, which suggests a higher probability (~85-87%) that the fight proceeds compared to my initial ~75% estimate. This is valuable because fights scheduled this close typically do happen unless there's a last-minute emergency. Forecaster 3 introduces significant new information about Gastelum that I had underweighted: he's a highly experienced veteran with 24 UFC appearances, won The Ultimate Fighter 17, and has solid recent form (2 wins in last 3 fights). This veteran status and recent success should lower my confidence in Pyfer's chances if the fight occurs. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the inherent unpredictability of MMA outcomes. The convergence of our forecasts (45-48%) despite slightly different reasoning paths suggests we're identifying similar base rates and key uncertainties. Forecaster 2's identification of Pyfer's technical advantages (grappling, reach) provides useful context, though this must be balanced against Gastelum's vast experience edge.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my component probabilities. The 12-day proximity increases my estimate that the fight happens from 75% to approximately 85% - most fights this close to the event do proceed barring unexpected issues. However, the new information about Gastelum being a 24-fight UFC veteran and TUF winner makes me reduce Pyfer's win probability from 60% to approximately 54-55%. While Pyfer has excellent recent momentum and technical advantages, Gastelum's experience level is substantial and he's shown he can still win at this stage of his career. These adjustments partially offset each other: 85% (fight happens) × 54% (Pyfer wins) = approximately 46%. The Gastelum experience factor is meaningful - fighting someone with 24 UFC appearances versus 5 is a significant gap. However, Pyfer's recent knockout power and winning streak keep him competitive. I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 45% to 46%, reflecting increased confidence the fight happens but decreased confidence in Pyfer's chances against a more credentialed opponent than I initially weighted.",
