    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors mine, emphasizing the powerful downward momentum, pervasive nature of the decline, and lack of clear positive catalysts. Their 25% forecast differs from my 27% by only 2 points - essentially identical given forecasting uncertainty.\n\nForecaster 3 diverges significantly at 41%, placing substantially more weight on mean-reversion at extreme levels. Their argument that 'after sharp drops, subsequent months often stabilize or rebound modestly' and that 'small swings of 1-2 points are common' is worth serious consideration. They correctly note the threshold is low - just exceeding 50.8 - so even a minor uptick of 1 point would resolve Yes.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 41% probability difficult to justify given the specific context. While mean-reversion is real at extreme values, the April decline wasn't merely statistical noise - it reflected genuine, ongoing economic deterioration. The key facts weighing against a bounce: (1) inflation expectations at 6.7% are the highest since 1981 and historically sticky; (2) companies are actively implementing tariff-driven price increases now; (3) unemployment concerns reached their highest since 2009 and continue rising; (4) the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous' across all demographics, suggesting no resilient segments; (5) Leading Economic Indicators have fallen four consecutive months.\n\nMean-reversion typically requires either statistical noise dissipating or fundamental improvements. Here, the fundamentals are genuinely deteriorating, not just perceived to be. The tariff policy continues, price pass-through is ongoing, and there's no clear positive catalyst visible in the next 17 days.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should modestly update upward to acknowledge Forecaster 3's mean-reversion argument more fully. At extreme historical lows, even amidst negative fundamentals, measurement variability and the psychological tendency for small bounces after dramatic drops create upside risk. The threshold being barely above 50.8 means even a 1-point stabilization to 51.8 would resolve Yes. However, I cannot justify moving to 41% because: (1) the April decline reflected genuine economic deterioration, not noise; (2) inflation expectations at 6.7% typically persist and weigh heavily on sentiment; (3) tariff-driven price increases are actively rolling through the economy; (4) the 'pervasive and unanimous' nature of April's decline signals deep-seated rather than fleeting concerns; (5) no obvious positive catalyst exists for May. The negative momentum remains dominant, but acknowledging mean-reversion risk at historical extremes and the low threshold for Yes resolution, I'll update modestly from 27% to 30%.",
