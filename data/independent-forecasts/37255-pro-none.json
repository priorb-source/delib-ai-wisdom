    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected and rapid political breakthrough occurs, unifying the key political factions. As a gesture of national unity and re-engagement with Africa, the newly cooperative legislature fast-tracks the ratification of the AfCFTA agreement in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the persistent state of political fragmentation and instability in Libya. The country has been functionally divided for years, with rival governments and a fractured legislature. Ratification of an international treaty like AfCFTA requires a stable, functioning legislative process, which Libya currently lacks. The House of Representatives, the body required for ratification, has been embroiled in the ongoing power struggle and has not demonstrated the capacity or political will to pass such a measure.\n\nThe status quo, which heavily favors a 'No' outcome, has been in place since Libya signed the agreement in 2019 without moving to ratification. With only two months remaining until the deadline, the time is extremely short for the monumental political shift that would be required. Legislative processes are slow even in stable nations; in Libya's current context, they are largely paralyzed.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because unforeseen political breakthroughs, often driven by international mediation or a sudden shift in domestic power dynamics, are not impossible, even if they are highly improbable. A 'black swan' event could lead to a rapid political settlement that includes fast-tracking such international commitments as a sign of progress.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there are no current indicators suggesting such a breakthrough is imminent. The primary focus of all political actors in Libya remains on security, consolidating power, and resolving fundamental disputes over governance and resources, not on pan-African trade policy. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see credible evidence of a lasting political and security agreement between the main factions and a clear public commitment to advancing the AfCFTA ratification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
