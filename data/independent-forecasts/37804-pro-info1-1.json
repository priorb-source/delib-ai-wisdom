  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. If no action were taken, the long-standing recommendation of 0.7 mg/L would remain in place. However, recent events have made this outcome unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 2025 announcement by the HHS Secretary, the CDC acts swiftly to remove the recommendation page or updates it to state that the guidance is under review. This administrative change is completed before July 1, 2025, thus resolving the question as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia, procedural requirements for the Community Preventive Services Task Force, or internal resistance within the CDC delay any official change to the website. Despite the Secretary's stated intent, the 0.7 mg/L recommendation is still the official text on the CDC's webpage on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the new information from April 2025. The HHS Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long and public history of opposing water fluoridation. His announcement of plans to instruct the CDC to stop the recommendation is a clear and powerful signal of intent from the highest level of the department overseeing the CDC. This is not a subtle policy shift; it is a direct, top-down directive on a signature issue for the Secretary. The coordinated actions from the EPA (reviewing risks) and FDA (phasing out tablets) indicate this is a unified administration policy, making it highly probable that the CDC will comply. The resolution criteria make a 'No' outcome even more likely, as a full-scale scientific review and replacement recommendation are not required. Simply taking the webpage offline or adding a sentence that the recommendation is 'under review' would resolve the question as 'No'. This is an administratively simple task that can be accomplished well within the deadline. My probability is not lower than 10 because there is a non-zero chance of bureaucratic delay. Public health agencies have established processes and may have internal staff who resist rapid, politically-driven changes, potentially delaying the update past the July 1 deadline. My probability is not higher because this would require assuming that a direct initiative from the Secretary on a key personal issue would be thwarted by institutional inertia over a two-month period, which seems improbable given the coordinated multi-agency actions. I would increase the probability of a 'Yes' outcome if there were reports of significant internal pushback, legal challenges, or a statement from the Task Force indicating a much longer timeline for review. I would decrease it further if the CDC issues a press release confirming the change ahead of the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
