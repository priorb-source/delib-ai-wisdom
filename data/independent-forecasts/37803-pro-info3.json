  "information": "The Department of Defense's official climate resilience portal, climate.mil, has been offline since January 21, 2025. This takedown is part of a broader removal of climate-related content across various federal websites. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration shows that similar websites taken offline, such as pages on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, often remained down for several years. While some Democratic senators have reportedly demanded an explanation for the portal's removal and may hold hearings in June, no binding mandate or official plan to restore the website has been announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The website is currently offline and, without any change in policy or new action, it will remain offline on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current administration continues its policy of removing climate-related information from federal websites. Political pressure from congressional hearings in June proves insufficient to force a policy reversal within the short timeframe, and no binding mandate is enacted. The website remains offline past the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense political pressure, potentially amplified by national security arguments from within the Department of Defense itself following June's hearings, leads the administration to make a targeted concession. The DoD is directed to restore climate.mil to demonstrate its focus on military readiness, and the technical work is completed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and historical precedent. The website, climate.mil, was taken down as part of a deliberate, administration-wide policy, not due to a technical error. The provided research material notes that during the previous Trump administration, similar websites that were taken down remained offline for several years, which is a strong precedent. The resolution date is only six weeks away, which is a very short timeframe for the existing political pressure from some senators to overcome bureaucratic inertia and reverse a standing policy decision. While hearings are planned for June, they are not guaranteed to produce a binding outcome. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' a significant and rapid reversal of policy would need to occur, which is a low-probability event. My probability is not lower than 5% because there is a non-zero chance that a combination of political pressure, media attention from the hearings, and internal lobbying from military leaders who view climate change as a national security threat could force a quick and targeted reversal. My probability is not higher because the barriers to restoration—official policy, historical precedent, and the short timeline—are substantial. I would increase my forecast if a binding agreement or a public commitment from the DoD to restore the site emerged from the June hearings. Conversely, I would lower it if the hearings conclude with no commitment, or if the administration explicitly defends the removal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
