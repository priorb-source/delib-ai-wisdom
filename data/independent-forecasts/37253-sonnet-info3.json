  "information": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No nuclear test - North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017, maintaining an 8-year hiatus",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues its current pattern of refraining from nuclear tests despite aggressive rhetoric. Kim Jong Un's statements serve primarily as domestic propaganda and international posturing. The regime focuses on missile tests and other military demonstrations that don't cross the nuclear testing threshold, partially due to international sanctions pressure and lack of immediate strategic necessity.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kim Jong Un follows through on his April 2025 statement about 'accelerating nuclear armament' and authorizes a seventh nuclear test. This could be triggered by escalating tensions, a desire to demonstrate technological advances after 8 years, or as a strategic response to the strengthened US-South Korea-Japan trilateral partnership. The test would likely occur at the Punggye-ri test site or another prepared location.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. North Korea conducted 6 nuclear tests between 2006-2017, but hasn't tested since September 2017 - an 8-year gap. This prolonged hiatus suggests either technical constraints, strategic choice, or responsiveness to sanctions and diplomatic pressure. The recent rhetoric from Kim Jong Un is notable, particularly his April 2025 statement about 'accelerating nuclear armament' and January 2025 commitment to 'indefinite' nuclear development. However, North Korea frequently employs aggressive nuclear rhetoric without following through with actual tests. The research assistant's report confirms intensified international pressure through the US-South Korea-Japan partnership and EU condemnations, which historically have deterred testing. The critical factor is the extremely short 2-month timeframe. Nuclear tests require significant preparation including site readiness, technical setup, and often involve observable intelligence indicators that haven't been reported. The world changes slowly, and the 8-year status quo of no testing carries substantial weight. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the very short timeframe makes preparation unlikely, (2) the 8-year pattern suggests strategic restraint, (3) rhetoric rarely translates to immediate action, and (4) international pressure remains high. My forecast is not lower because: (1) Kim's recent statements are unusually specific about nuclear acceleration, (2) North Korea has demonstrated willingness to test despite sanctions, and (3) geopolitical tensions could catalyze action. I would update higher with satellite evidence of test site preparations, acute crisis escalation, or specific intelligence warnings. I would update lower as more time passes without activity or if diplomatic engagement increases.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
