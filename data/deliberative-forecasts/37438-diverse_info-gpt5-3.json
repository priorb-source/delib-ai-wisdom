    "review": "Both forecasters added concrete, near-term liquidity detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: ~$226M cash as of Jan 31, 2025, a sharp drop in quarterly cash burn to ~$3M, and no debt maturities until 2028. Forecaster 3 also noted recent positive operational signals (NEVI funding win on May 1 and a product launch). These points directly bear on the key question for a filing within 57 days: immediate liquidity pressure. If accurate, they materially reduce the probability of a near-term Chapter 11. I agree with their emphasis on the short horizon and the absence of catalysts (maturities, covenant stress, or payment defaults). The only caveat is epistemic: I haven’t independently verified the exact cash/burn figures or whether the FY25 filing included a going‑concern warning. But even with that caveat, the balance of evidence favors a very low near-term filing risk.",
    "rationale": "The resolution window is short, and the new information suggests: (1) sufficient cash runway (>$200M) relative to a recent quarterly cash outflow that is de minimis if ~$3M; (2) no near-term maturities until 2028, limiting creditor leverage; (3) a plausible path to maintain listing via reverse split if needed (listing status is not a bankruptcy trigger); and (4) recent positive operational news (NEVI funds and product activity) inconsistent with a company on the cusp of an imminent filing. Bankruptcy within 57 days would likely require an unanticipated shock—e.g., a major legal/settlement hit, restatement/fraud, catastrophic product issue, or a sudden vendor/creditor pullback. Those are possible but low base-rate events. Given this, my prior 12% was too high. I’m updating down materially, while leaving a small tail for unforeseen shocks or unpublicized covenant/min-liquidity constraints. I would move upward on any going-concern warning, debt covenant breach, auditor issue, accelerated vendor terms, or missed payments; and downward on any confirmed financing, additional grants, or continued low/positive operating cash flow.",
