    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No additional payment is made. Zimbabwe continues to face fiscal constraints and does not make another disbursement in the short timeframe remaining.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe adheres to an infrequent payment schedule, with the next compensation payment not scheduled until after June 1, 2025. Financial constraints, bureaucratic processes, and competing budgetary priorities prevent any additional disbursement in the 5.5 weeks remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe follows through on its reaffirmed commitment by making a second payment before June 1, 2025. Having already allocated funds and established payment mechanisms with the first disbursement, they demonstrate momentum and good faith to international creditors by making another tranche payment within the next 39 days.",
    "rationale": "The critical context is that Zimbabwe made its FIRST payment under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed on April 9, 2025 - just 14 days ago at $3.1 million. This was the inaugural payment after approximately 5 years since the deed was signed, suggesting payments are infrequent rather than regular.\n\nFactors pointing toward a lower probability: (1) The 5-year gap before the first payment indicates these disbursements are rare events, not routine transactions. (2) Zimbabwe faces well-documented economic challenges and fiscal constraints that make frequent payments unlikely. (3) Government payment processes, especially for international obligations, typically involve significant administrative time. (4) Making two payments within a span of less than 2 months would be highly unusual for a government with limited resources. (5) No evidence suggests an imminent second payment is planned or that funds are already allocated.\n\nFactors pointing toward higher probability: (1) The April 10 article mentions Zimbabwe 'reaffirms commitment,' suggesting ongoing intentions. (2) The recent payment demonstrates current political will and that some funds are available. (3) International pressure for debt sustainability might encourage follow-up payments. (4) 39 days is technically enough time if funds and administrative processes are ready.\n\nMy research assistant provided no additional information that would suggest another payment is imminent. The status quo heavily favors no additional payment given the historical pattern. For my forecast to increase substantially, I would need evidence of: scheduled payment tranches, allocated funds for additional disbursements, or official announcements of imminent payments. For it to decrease further, I would need evidence of economic crises or official statements postponing payments.\n\nBalancing these factors with appropriate weight on the status quo (payments are rare), I assess a low but non-zero probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
