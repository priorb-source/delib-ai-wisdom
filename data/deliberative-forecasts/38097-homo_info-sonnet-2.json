    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critically important new information that I had not considered: Laurent Gbagbo may already be disqualified from the 2025 electoral list due to a 2018 conviction resulting in loss of civic rights. If accurate, this would mean the resolution criteria are already satisfied as of May 30, 2025. This is a major oversight in my initial analysis. However, I note that my research assistant's report mentioned Thiam's disqualification but did not mention Gbagbo being currently disqualified, which creates some uncertainty about Forecaster 2's claim. The BBC background article about a 'main opposition leader removed' could refer to either Thiam or Gbagbo. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns closely with my initial analysis but doesn't address the Gbagbo question. The critical issue is whether Gbagbo has been formally removed from the 2025 electoral list during this electoral cycle. If he has, the probability should be very high. If not, the probability remains moderate based on risk factors and recent precedent.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward based on Forecaster 2's evidence about Laurent Gbagbo's potential current disqualification status. The claim that he remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction with loss of civic rights is specific and sourced. If Gbagbo has been formally excluded from the 2025 electoral list at any point before today (May 30), then the question resolves YES, since it asks about disqualifications occurring 'before July 1, 2025.' However, I'm not updating to 90% because: (1) my research assistant didn't mention Gbagbo's disqualification, creating uncertainty about whether this information is current and accurate; (2) there's ambiguity about whether a 2018 conviction translates to formal removal from the 2025 electoral list during this cycle; (3) the timing and legal status require verification. The substantial weight of Forecaster 2's specific claims, combined with Laurent Gbagbo's controversial history and the active pattern of opposition disqualifications this cycle, justifies a major upward revision. But the lack of corroboration in my initial briefing and uncertainty about current legal status prevents me from going as high as 90%.",
