  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (the election is expected in autumn 2025, likely October)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the SPÖ remains first and wins a plurality of seats",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FPÖ overtakes the SPÖ in late-campaign polling and wins a narrow plurality on strong salience of immigration/cost-of-living and/or an SPÖ Vienna scandal or leadership turmoil; fragmented left/centrist vote (SPÖ/Greens/NEOS) plus differential turnout amplifies FPÖ’s advantage into the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SPÖ maintains its typical Vienna lead (low-30s percent range) into election day, with FPÖ second and others (ÖVP, Greens, NEOS) splitting the remainder; proportional seat allocation mirrors the vote lead, yielding the SPÖ the largest caucus.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and history: The SPÖ has led every Viennese state election since 1945, and Vienna’s demographics (urban, renter-heavy, public-sector presence) structurally favor the SPÖ compared with national patterns. That historical dominance and institutional strength (organization, incumbency, mayoral brand) deserve extra weight because political baselines change slowly.\n- Polls/status quo: Recent Vienna polling (e.g., March 2025) generally shows the SPÖ in first place with FPÖ competitive but usually second. Seat allocation in Vienna closely tracks vote rank, so a small vote lead typically suffices for most seats.\n- Headwinds/risks (why not higher): FPÖ has national momentum and could top a fragmented field if issue salience centers on immigration, security, or cost-of-living. Any SPÖ Vienna scandal, unpopular city policies (e.g., utilities, housing), or leadership instability could narrow or erase a small lead. If multiple reputable polls show FPÖ consistently first by a few points, the prior can be overcome.\n- Supportive factors (why not lower): Even when FPÖ surges nationally, Vienna usually lags that surge. The SPÖ’s local brand and coalition math (with Greens/NEOS siphoning votes from each other more than from SPÖ) often leave SPÖ ahead. Also, if FPÖ is in or tied to an unpopular federal government by late 2025, governing drag could blunt its Vienna performance.\n- What would move me up: A stable, multi-poll SPÖ lead of 5–7 points in Vienna, improving mayoral approval, or early federal governing drag on FPÖ. What would move me down: Two or more independent pollsters showing FPÖ ahead by 2–3+ points for several weeks, a credible SPÖ scandal/leadership rupture in Vienna, or a sharp shift in issue salience that benefits FPÖ across urban districts.\nGiven the enduring baseline advantage for SPÖ in Vienna but acknowledging a real FPÖ path to a narrow plurality, I put the probability modestly above two-thirds.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
