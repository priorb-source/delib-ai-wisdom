    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my reasoning, emphasizing the recent closure, serious security concerns, historical precedent, and absence of negotiation reports. Their 20% forecast is slightly more optimistic than mine but within a reasonable range. However, Forecaster 3 made a critical error stating 'only one day remaining until the resolution date' when actually approximately 31 days remain (May 31 to July 1, 2025). This miscalculation fundamentally undermines their 3% forecast, which was premised on having only 24 hours left. With a full month remaining rather than one day, Forecaster 3's reasoning doesn't hold. The key question is whether one month provides sufficient time for diplomatic resolution of serious security issues involving terrorism and arms smuggling.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, my original reasoning stands. Forecaster 3's temporal error invalidates their ultra-low forecast. Forecaster 2's analysis reinforces my concerns but is marginally more optimistic. The core factors remain unchanged: (1) The closure occurred in May 2025, making it only weeks old; (2) The stated reasons - Mahmuda terror group attacks, arms smuggling, and trade disputes - are serious security matters requiring substantial diplomatic work; (3) Historical precedent shows such closures can persist for months or years; (4) No credible reporting indicates active negotiations or progress toward reopening; (5) One month is an extremely compressed timeframe for resolving complex bilateral security issues. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point that one month technically allows for high-level intervention, I maintain that the probability remains low given the absence of any signals suggesting such intervention is underway. The lack of reporting on diplomatic efforts is particularly telling - if reopening were imminent or under serious discussion, we would likely see some evidence. I'm holding my forecast at 15% to reflect that while rapid diplomatic breakthroughs are possible, they remain improbable given the current information environment and the complexity of the underlying issues.",
