    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days until the cutoff (00:00 July 8, 2025, Rio local time).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new full-member invitations are issued before or during the 17th BRICS Summit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Leaders emphasize consolidation after the 2023–25 expansions, highlight the new partner framework, and defer full-member decisions to ongoing review. The joint declaration references criteria and timelines for partner engagement but names no new full members.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BRICS upgrades at least one partner country (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Kazakhstan) to full membership, or issues a fresh full-membership invite to a non-partner with broad acceptability. Announcement is framed as a calibrated, incremental expansion with entry effective in 2026.",
    "rationale": "Considerations:\n- Recent trajectory: After the large 2023 expansion, the 16th summit (2024) created a partner track and did not add full members, but Indonesia’s elevation to full membership in Jan 2025 shows the pipeline is active and that upgrades can happen between summits. This slightly raises the base chance of another invitation by or at Rio.\n- Unanimity hurdle: All members must agree. India and Brazil have been more cautious on rapid expansion; risk-averse members may prefer to consolidate (especially with Saudi Arabia’s status unresolved and the New Development Bank’s exposure to sanctions-sensitive members). This dampens odds of quick additions like Belarus or Cuba and makes consensus more likely around neutral, economically significant partners (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, possibly Nigeria).\n- Host incentives: Brazil may want a tangible deliverable, but can also claim success via institutional deepening without adding members. The lack of credible pre-summit reporting (as of May 31) on concrete candidates suggests no done deal yet, which lowers near-term odds.\n- Candidate landscape: Several partners are plausible and politically palatable (Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan). Others face higher veto risk (Belarus, Cuba) or have not even confirmed partner participation (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam), making July elevation less likely.\nWhy not higher: Unanimity and member caution after a rapid expansion; no strong public signaling yet; managing optics/sanctions and NDB considerations; unresolved Saudi invitation complicates narratives.\nWhy not lower: Clear strategic interest from China/Russia to keep momentum; Brazil may want a win as host; at least one or two partners (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand) are relatively non-controversial and have expressed interest; Indonesia’s recent accession is a precedent that the pipeline is moving.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of sherpa consensus; explicit supportive statements from India and Brazil naming one or two candidates; leaked draft communiqués referencing invitations; NDB steps to onboard a candidate country.\nWhat would move me down: Signals from India/Brazil prioritizing consolidation over expansion; partner countries walking back interest; agenda leaks with no expansion item; increased geopolitical friction making consensus harder.\nResearch assistant info used: None beyond the provided background; no additional information available.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
