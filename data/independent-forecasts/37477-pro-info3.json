  "information": "An executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "22 days. The outcome will be known by June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given that major, economy-wide tariffs were imposed just over a month ago, the status quo is that the topic will continue to be a front-page news story.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on the front page of either The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, or both, every single day between now and June 1, 2025. This occurs as the economic and political fallout from the April 2nd executive order continues to generate newsworthy developments.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before June 1, 2025, a different major news event, such as a large-scale natural disaster or a sudden geopolitical crisis, completely dominates the news cycle, pushing any mention of tariffs off the front pages of both newspapers simultaneously for that day.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high news salience of the tariff issue and the short timeframe for it to disappear. The research assistant's report indicates a sweeping 'minimum benchmark tariff' was imposed via executive order on April 2, 2025. This is not a single past event, but an ongoing policy with cascading, front-page-worthy consequences, such as consumer stockpiling, major supply chain disruptions, and impacts on other industries like newsprint. The Wall Street Journal, in particular, is highly likely to maintain front-page coverage of such a significant economic policy. For a 'Yes' outcome, this dominant story would need to be completely absent from the front pages of *both* major newspapers on the same day. Over a short 22-day window, this is highly unlikely. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because unforeseen, non-economic events (e.g., a major disaster or political scandal) can and do suddenly dominate news cycles, potentially displacing all other stories for a day. Weekends can also have softer news days, slightly increasing the chance of an omission. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the tariff story is multifaceted, generating continuous new angles for reporting—from diplomatic fallout to industry-specific impacts to consumer price changes. The odds of both the NYT and WSJ simultaneously finding no front-page-worthy angle on this topic on any given day in the next three weeks are very low. \n\nI would update my forecast higher (towards 'Yes') if a new, massive, and unrelated story breaks that is guaranteed to dominate headlines for several days. I would update lower (towards 'No') if a significant retaliatory action by a major trade partner were announced, ensuring tariffs remain a top story.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
