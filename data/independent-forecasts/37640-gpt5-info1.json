  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online, as most federal program websites persist for months after organizational changes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA promptly decommissions the domain or disables hosting/DNS before July 1, or a prolonged outage/DoS occurs exactly when Metaculus checks via IsItDownRightNow, causing it to register as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "EPA keeps Energystar.gov live (possibly with a banner or redirect) during reorganization, or only archives it after FY quarter-end; normal uptime means the site is reachable when checked.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Energystar.gov is currently up per IsItDownRightNow (as of May 7). Government websites typically remain available well beyond program restructurings due to IT change controls, archiving obligations (NARA), communications needs, and path dependencies. Even when content is deprecated, agencies often keep the domain live or redirect rather than pulling it down abruptly. That inertia argues for a Yes by July 1.\n- Timing: Only ~7 weeks remain. The NYT-reported plan to eliminate Energy Star is part of a broader reorganization targeting savings by 2026. That suggests a phased process, making a complete domain decommission by July 1 less likely.\n- Precedents: In prior federal admin transitions, controversial EPA pages were removed or archived, but domains and major program sites often persisted, sometimes with redirects or notices, for months or longer.\n- Risks lowering the probability:\n  1) Policy signaling: Leadership could take a high-visibility step and purposefully shutter or 410 the domain before July 1. I see this as possible but not the modal path within 7 weeks.\n  2) Measurement risk: The resolution hinges on IsItDownRightNow at the moment Metaculus checks on/after July 1. Brief outages, DNS hiccups, or CDN issues could cause a false “down” reading. I estimate this at a low single-digit percent.\n- Why not higher: I subtract roughly 6–8% for intentional early decommission/takedown risk and ~2–3% for transient outage/measurement risk.\n- Why not lower: The combination of short timeline, bureaucratic inertia, and typical federal web deprecation patterns supports the site remaining up through July 1; the current uptime and lack of a published shutdown date further support this.\n- What would move me up: Signals of delay or pushback (e.g., unions/Congress/legal reviews), explicit guidance to maintain public-facing info, or continued normal operations into late June.\n- What would move me down: An official EPA announcement specifying an imminent shutdown/redirect of Energystar.gov before July 1, visible teardown steps (DNS changes, persistent redirects to a non-.gov host, 410/404 on the root), or sustained outages in late June.\n- Research assistant summary: EPA leadership reportedly plans to eliminate Energy Star and related climate divisions, targeting large savings by 2026. This increases the medium-term risk to the site but doesn’t strongly imply a takedown within the next 7 weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
