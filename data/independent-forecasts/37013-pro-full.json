  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10-12 days. The election is on May 1, 2025, with results expected shortly thereafter.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party is currently the largest party on Cornwall Council with 44 seats, a lead of 31 over the Liberal Democrats' 13 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives lose a significant number of seats due to national unpopularity and a split vote with Reform UK. However, the anti-Conservative vote is distributed among the Liberal Democrats, Labour, and Independents, preventing any single party from overtaking the Conservatives, who retain their position as the largest party, albeit with a much-reduced plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A collapse in the Conservative vote, exacerbated by the rise of Reform UK splitting the right-wing vote, allows the Liberal Democrats to capitalize perfectly. Building on their 2024 general election momentum in Cornwall, they achieve a historic swing, nearly doubling their seat count to become the largest party on the council for the first time.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant challenge of overcoming the status quo, balanced against an exceptionally volatile political environment. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the sheer scale of the Conservative's current majority. The Liberal Democrats need to overcome a 31-seat deficit, a monumental task that would require a political earthquake. Historically, they have never been the largest party in Cornwall.\n\nHowever, several factors make such an upheaval more plausible than usual, justifying a non-trivial probability. The national polling for the Conservative party is at a historic low (22%), while the rise of Reform UK (25%) is poised to split the right-wing vote, a dynamic noted by analyst John Curtice. This could allow Liberal Democrat candidates to win seats on a plurality. Furthermore, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated recent success in the region, winning two constituencies in the 2024 general election, and are running a well-funded, full-slate campaign for this local election. The retirement of the Conservative council leader and other key councillors could also weaken the local party's incumbency advantage.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 30% because overcoming a 31-seat gap in a single election cycle remains an exceptionally difficult task, and the status quo often has significant inertia. Even a catastrophic result for the Conservatives might see them retain the largest number of seats if the opposition vote is fragmented.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of a deeply unpopular national government, a major vote-splitting challenger from the right, and a locally resurgent and well-organized opposition creates a 'perfect storm' scenario where a historic swing is a very real possibility.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a reliable, Cornwall-specific poll showed a clear lead for the Liberal Democrats in seat projections. Conversely, I would decrease it if polling suggested the Conservative local vote was holding up better than national trends, or if there was evidence of a significant surge for Labour or Independents that would further splinter the anti-Conservative vote.",
