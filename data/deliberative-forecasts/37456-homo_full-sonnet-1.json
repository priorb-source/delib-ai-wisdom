    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 38-45%, indicating strong consensus on the key factors. Forecaster 3 makes an interesting point about anchoring to 50% probability given we're right at the 90-day median timeframe, then adjusting down for complicating factors. However, I find this anchoring approach potentially misleading - the median is simply the midpoint of the distribution, not a prior probability for any individual case. The specific characteristics of this recall (multi-state foodservice distribution, large volume, extended shelf life) suggest it belongs in the slower half of the distribution. \n\nForecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine, noting that 40 days without closure suggests we're likely in the 60-120 day range rather than the faster end. This is a strong point - if this were tracking toward quick resolution, we'd expect to see movement by day 40. Both forecasters appropriately weight the Class III designation as a factor favoring faster closure, which I also considered. \n\nNo new evidence was presented that I hadn't already factored in. The clustering of forecasts suggests we're all seeing the probability landscape similarly. The key question remains whether the complicating factors push resolution time from 90 days to something longer than 94 days, and we all assess moderate-to-high likelihood that they do.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I remain confident in my core analysis but recognize the clustering at 38-45% suggests the true probability likely falls in this range. My original 38% may be slightly too pessimistic. The key insight is that we have 94 days total (just 4 days more than the 90-day median), and we're already 40 days in with no closure signal. This means the recall needs to close within the next 55 days to meet the deadline.\n\nThe complicating factors (multi-state foodservice distribution, 212,268 pounds, shelf life to March 2026) historically push Class III recalls above the median. However, the Class III classification itself indicates low priority for rapid closure but also less intensive verification requirements. The absence of illnesses and the precautionary nature suggest straightforward resolution once the verification process completes.\n\nThe most compelling argument is that 40 days have elapsed without closure, suggesting we're not in the fast-resolution category (30-60 days) but rather tracking toward the 90-120 day range. This makes the 94-day deadline tight but not impossible to meet. I'll update modestly upward to 40% to reflect the central tendency of the forecaster consensus while maintaining my view that the complicating factors more likely than not push this recall past July 1.",
