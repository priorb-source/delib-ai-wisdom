    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that I had either overlooked or underweighted. The most significant point, which both raised, is the strong evidence drawn from the status quo: President Trump has already been in office for nearly five months and has not issued a presidential action mentioning the 'Diversity Visa', despite being prolific on immigration matters. This recent record of inaction is a much better predictor than his general stance from years prior. My initial analysis incorrectly assumed a 'new administration' context rather than an ongoing one. Secondly, Forecaster 3's point about the strict wording requirement is crucial. The official name 'Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) program' is very likely to be used in a formal presidential action over the more colloquial 'Diversity Visa', creating a significant hurdle for a 'Yes' resolution even if the program is targeted. These arguments are highly convincing and directly address the core assumptions of the forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 30% to 15%. The primary reason for this large adjustment is correcting my initial oversight regarding the timeline. The fact that President Trump has occupied the White House since January 2025 and has not yet taken this specific action in nearly five months is powerful evidence that it is not a top-tier priority. The window for 'Day One' executive orders has long passed, and the administration's focus has clearly been on other immigration issues like border control and asylum. The status quo of inaction is therefore a much stronger anchor than I first assessed. \n\nFurthermore, the other forecasters correctly highlighted the resolution's strict wording constraint. The likelihood that an official presidential action would use the formal 'Diversity Immigrant Visa program' instead of the required 'Diversity Visa' is high. This introduces a substantial risk of the question resolving as 'No' on a technicality, even if the administration acts against the program. My previous forecast did not adequately account for this failure mode. Combining the strong evidence of recent inaction with the high probability of alternative phrasing in an official document, the likelihood of a 'Yes' resolution within the short remaining timeframe is considerably lower than my initial estimate.",
