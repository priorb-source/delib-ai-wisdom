    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar analyses and probability ranges (15%, 20%, 20%), which provides confidence that we've identified the key considerations. The other forecasters reinforced rather than challenged my core reasoning: the 48-day timeframe is extremely constraining for a major policy termination, administrative and legal complexities create significant hurdles, and uncertainty exists about the tracker maintainers' standards for marking objectives 'complete.' Forecaster 3 raised a particularly valuable point about implementation lag - even if dramatic actions were announced, the tracker's recognition of completion might extend beyond the deadline. Forecaster 2 helpfully emphasized the distinction between full implementation versus official announcements, which is crucial for understanding what the tracker might accept. However, no new evidence was presented that would substantially shift my probability assessment. The 'in progress' designation remains important evidence of momentum, and the possibility of aggressive administrative action within 48 days, while unlikely, cannot be dismissed entirely.",
    "rationale": "My original 20% forecast appears well-calibrated given the convergence with other expert forecasters. The core constraints remain unchanged: 48 days is extraordinarily short for terminating a major federal program established by law, especially one serving hundreds of thousands of borrowers. Even aggressive executive actions would likely face immediate legal challenges that could prevent the tracker from marking the objective 'complete' by July 1. The 'in progress' status suggests some actions have been taken, but moving from 'in progress' to 'complete' for such a significant policy change in 48 days requires either: (1) unprecedented administrative speed, or (2) tracker maintainers accepting preliminary actions as sufficient for completion. Both scenarios are possible but unlikely. The deliberation process confirmed rather than challenged these key considerations, with Forecaster 3's point about implementation lag particularly strengthening the case for a conservative forecast. I see no compelling reason to adjust from 20%.",
