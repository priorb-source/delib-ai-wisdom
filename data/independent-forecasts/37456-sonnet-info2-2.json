  "information": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days remain until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, meaning about 40 days have already elapsed since issuance.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is that the recall remains Active, which would result in a No resolution. The recall is currently Active as of May 7, 2025, and maintaining this status through July 1 would mean the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation and resolution process takes longer than expected due to administrative procedures, verification requirements, or discovery of additional issues. The FSIS maintains the Active status through July 1, 2025, either because the investigation isn't complete or because closing procedures haven't been finalized despite the low-risk nature of the contamination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given this is a Class III recall with no reported illnesses and issued out of abundance of caution, the FSIS completes its investigation and verification processes efficiently. The recall is administratively closed within the remaining 55 days, which is reasonable for a low-risk recall that has already been active for 40 days.",
    "rationale": "This is a Class III recall - the lowest risk category indicating the violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No illnesses have been reported and Cargill issued it preemptively. These factors typically correlate with faster recall resolution times. However, the recall has already been Active for approximately 40 days (from March 28 to May 7, 2025), which represents a significant portion of time. Class III recalls typically resolve within 1-3 months, and we're approaching the lower end of that range. The fact that it remains Active suggests either ongoing investigation or administrative processing time. With 55 days remaining until July 1, there is still reasonable time for closure. The low-risk classification and lack of health consequences strongly favor eventual closure, but bureaucratic processes can be slow regardless of risk level. The status quo bias suggests maintaining Active status, but the specific characteristics of this recall (Class III, precautionary) work against that baseline. My forecast isn't higher because the recall is still Active after 40 days, suggesting the process isn't expedited despite the low risk. It isn't lower because there remains substantial time and the recall characteristics strongly suggest it should close. I would update higher if I saw evidence of similar Class III recalls closing within 60-90 days, or lower if I found typical closure times exceed 100 days.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall.

No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
