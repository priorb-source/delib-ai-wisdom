  "information": "Some U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025, when the NUFORC website will be checked for June 2025 cube-shaped sighting reports.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on recent data, cube-shaped UFO sightings do occur and get reported to NUFORC, though the exact monthly baseline rate is unclear. The status quo suggests some probability of at least one cube sighting being reported in a given month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without anyone reporting a cube-shaped UFO to NUFORC, or such reports are submitted but not yet processed and posted to the website by July 1, 2025. This could occur if genuine sightings are interpreted as conventional objects, if reporting volume is low during the month, or if random variation results in no cube-shaped sightings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one observer witnesses what they perceive as a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025, reports it to NUFORC either during or shortly after June, and NUFORC processes and posts the report to their website by July 1, 2025. This could be facilitated by favorable summer weather conditions, increased outdoor activity, or ongoing drone/UAP activity in various regions.",
    "rationale": "The key data point is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings, which is explicitly noted as rare in NUFORC's history. This tells us two important things: (1) cube-shaped sighting reports do occur and are recorded, and (2) having 6 in one month is unusual. However, the question requires only 1 sighting, setting a much lower bar. Without comprehensive historical data on typical monthly cube sighting rates, I must reason from limited information. If 6 sightings is rare, the baseline might be 0-2 per month, with many months having zero. June being a summer month could increase the probability slightly due to better weather, more people outdoors, and longer daylight hours - all factors that typically correlate with increased UFO reporting. The research assistant's information about cartel drones doesn't directly influence cube-specific sightings but confirms ongoing UAP activity. My forecast is not higher (75-85%) because: December 2024 might have been a significant outlier, we lack clear baseline rates, and most months may actually have zero cube sightings. My forecast is not lower (35-45%) because: the December 2024 example proves cube sightings are being reported and recorded, we only need one occurrence (not six), NUFORC actively processes reports, and summer conditions may favor increased sighting reports. I would update higher if I learned that cube sightings occur in most months or that there's been increased cube-shape reporting in early 2025. I would update lower if December 2024 was confirmed as a massive statistical outlier with most months having zero cube sightings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
