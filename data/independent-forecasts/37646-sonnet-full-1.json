  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Somalia currently shows as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon' on the Starlink availability map, and if this status remains unchanged through June 30, 2025, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows its typical African rollout timeline of 4-8 months. Despite receiving the license in mid-April 2025, technical preparations, equipment imports, payment infrastructure setup, and security considerations in Somalia cause delays. The service goes live in August or later 2025, about 4-5 months after licensing, which is after the July 1 deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink prioritizes Somalia's rollout due to U.S. government diplomatic pressure and follows the rapid Bangladesh model (2-week activation). Within the next few weeks, Starlink completes its preparations, leveraging existing infrastructure in Kenya/Ethiopia for gateway services, and updates the availability map to show Somalia as 'Available' by mid-to-late June 2025",
    "rationale": "The base rate evidence strongly suggests this timeline is compressed. Historical data shows African Starlink rollouts typically take 4-8 months from licensing to availability (Nigeria and Rwanda both took ~4 months). Somalia received its license in mid-April 2025, meaning a July 1 deadline represents only 2.5 months post-licensing - well below the median. As of today (May 15), one month after licensing, Somalia still shows as unavailable, which aligns with the longer timeline pattern. However, several factors create uncertainty. The Bangladesh precedent from May 2025 demonstrates that 2-week rollouts are technically possible, suggesting Starlink can move quickly when prioritized. The Washington Post report mentions U.S. diplomatic promotion of Starlink in Somalia, which could expedite the process. Elon Musk's personal announcement and the lack of need for in-country gateways (using inter-satellite links) are also positive indicators. Against this, Somalia faces unique challenges: fragile security, complex import logistics, and payment infrastructure difficulties. Some countries (Zambia, India, Vietnam) have remained 'Coming Soon' for many months. With 46 days remaining and Somalia still unavailable after 30 days, the window is narrowing. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of imminent launch announcements or faster recent rollout patterns. For it to be lower, I would need explicit delay announcements or no progress in the next two weeks. The probability balances the unfavorable base rate (4-8 months typical) against the possibility of expedited treatment and the Bangladesh precedent, yielding a modest but non-negligible chance of success",
