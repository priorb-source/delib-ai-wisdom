    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–3 weeks (preliminary May 2025 Michigan sentiment is typically released around Fri May 9–10; final late May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — if conditions that drove April’s plunge persist, May would be at or below 50.8 (unchanged counts as No).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Energy prices stay high or rise, inflation headlines remain hot, equities stay volatile, and the early-May jobs report disappoints. Consumer inflation expectations remain elevated. Result: May prints around 48–51.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Some stabilization: gasoline prices ease or stop rising, markets calm, no new geopolitical/economic shocks, and the early-May jobs report is steady. Mean reversion plus sampling noise nudge the index higher, e.g., 52–56.",
    "rationale": "April’s 50.8 is an extreme trough (reported as the second-lowest on record). From such lows, the index often exhibits mean reversion the following month unless there’s a continued or worsening shock. Preliminary data are sufficient to resolve this question, and the bar for Yes is simply “greater than 50.8.” Reasons to lean Yes: (1) Regression to the mean from an unusually depressed print; (2) Typical month-to-month sampling variation of 1–2 points can lift May above 50.8 even if underlying sentiment is roughly unchanged; (3) There is limited historical room to fall further without a clear new negative catalyst, given proximity to the all-time low. Reasons for caution (keeping the probability well below 80%): (1) Persistence risk — if the same drivers (e.g., elevated gas prices, sticky inflation expectations, equity drawdowns, or policy uncertainty) remain salient into the survey field period, sentiment could stay near or below 50.8; (2) “Second-leg-down” risk — in past episodes (e.g., mid-2022) the trough sometimes arrived the month after the initial plunge; (3) Event risk between now and early May (jobs report, FOMC communication, geopolitical news) could bias responses negatively. What would move me higher: clear stabilization or decline in gas prices through early May, calm/positive equity market tone, steady jobs data, and no hawkish surprise from the Apr 30 FOMC. What would move me lower: renewed market volatility, worsening energy prices, negative labor data, or fresh inflation shocks. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the April 50.8 figure and resolution rules. Balancing mean-reversion against persistence and event risks, I estimate a modestly better-than-even chance that May > 50.8.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
