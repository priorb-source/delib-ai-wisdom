    "review": "I find strong convergence among all three forecasts (2-3%), suggesting we've identified the same fundamental dynamics. Forecaster 2 raises important methodological points about discounting biased sources (Flynn, InfoWars) and highlights FBI Director Wray's confirmation that the post generated real-world threats - this is the most substantive new information, though it doesn't establish probable cause for arresting Comey himself. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes the 'any arrest for any reason' threshold, which technically includes unrelated incidents and provides justification for not going below 1-2%. All three analyses agree on the core barriers: no charges filed, only 32 days remaining, high First Amendment bar for 'true threats,' slow pace of federal investigations involving high-profile figures, and unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director. The 1% difference between our forecasts essentially reflects minor calibration differences on tail risks rather than substantive disagreement about the evidence or legal landscape.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, my core assessment remains unchanged. The convergence at 2-3% validates the fundamental reasoning: arresting a former FBI director within 32 days, with no charges or warrants currently filed, faces overwhelming structural and legal barriers. While Forecaster 2's point about Wray's statement regarding real-world threats is noteworthy, this demonstrates the post's impact on others rather than establishing probable cause that Comey made a prosecutable threat himself. The 2023 Supreme Court standard requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten remains a formidable obstacle. The broad 'any arrest' definition does create theoretical tail risk (unrelated incidents), but this was already factored into my 2% forecast. The absence of any concrete legal developments - grand jury activity, criminal referrals, target letters, or DOJ statements - in a context where 31 days remain makes anything above 2-3% unjustifiable. The political volatility and official Secret Service involvement prevent going lower, but don't overcome the fundamental barriers.",
