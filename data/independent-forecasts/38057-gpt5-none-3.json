    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8–10 weeks (UFC 316 is expected mid-to-late summer 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The bout takes place as scheduled and is competitive; most likely a decision. Slight lean to Dvalishvili on wrestling/control—but overall No remains marginally more likely once cancellation/NC risk is included.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "- The matchup is changed or canceled (injury/withdrawal). - The fight happens and O’Malley wins (KO/TKO or outpointing). - The bout ends in a draw or no-contest (not a Dvalishvili win).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight goes ahead at UFC 316 and Dvalishvili successfully implements relentless pressure wrestling, accumulates control time, and limits clean counters, taking a clear 48-47/49-46 decision or grinding late TKO.",
    "rationale": "I don’t have fresh market odds or confirmed event details beyond the prompt, so I’m grounding the estimate in fundamentals and typical pre-event risks. Stylistically, Dvalishvili has elite cardio and chain-wrestling that can bank rounds; O’Malley is a dangerous, accurate counter-striker with improved takedown defense and finishing threat. Over five rounds, judges often weigh damage versus control—creating volatility. If these two are priced close to even on pure skill, I’d give Dvalishvili a small edge to win minutes via pressure and volume wrestling. However, two factors pull the overall Yes probability below 50%: (1) event/lineup risk—main events a couple months out have a non-trivial chance (roughly 10–20%) of change/cancellation, which resolves as No, and (2) O’Malley’s KO equity and ability to sway rounds with cleaner strikes, making a No outcome (O’Malley win or any non-win for Merab) quite plausible. With no additional info from the research assistant, I can’t condition on who won their first meeting (the “2” implies a rematch) or current betting lines. Why not higher: cancellation/NC risk plus O’Malley’s finishing and round-stealing potential. Why not lower: Merab’s proven cardio/wrestling can systematically win rounds in a five-rounder. What would move me up: confirmed markets making Dvalishvili a solid favorite (e.g., ≤ -150), news of O’Malley injury/compromised camp, small cage, or altitude that favors grappling. What would move me down: markets favoring O’Malley, reports of Merab injury/rough weight cut, referee/judging trends prioritizing damage over control, or any increase in bout-cancellation risk.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
