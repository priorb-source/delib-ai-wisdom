    "review": "The other two forecasters reached a conclusion nearly identical to my own, based on the same core thesis of economic inertia over a very short time horizon. All three of us identified the April 2025 year-over-year growth of ~1.5% as a significant positive buffer and noted the lack of any reported major economic shocks during the month of May as the key evidence. Their analyses are convincing and strengthen my confidence in the overall assessment. I found two points particularly valuable: Forecaster 2's specific mention of the weather-sensitive utilities component as a concrete downside risk, and Forecaster 3's characterization of the ~1.5% buffer as positive but 'not exceptionally strong'. These arguments provide useful nuance regarding the tail risk of a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis is strongly validated by the consensus view. The core arguments remain the same: the May 2025 period has already passed without any reports of a major economic shock, and the most recent data from April 2025 showed solid positive year-over-year growth. Therefore, inertia is the most powerful factor at play. However, I am making a slight downward adjustment to my forecast. The deliberation with my peers has convinced me that I was slightly under-weighting the potential for a negative outcome due to normal monthly volatility. Forecaster 3's point that the ~1.5% buffer is not invulnerable, combined with Forecaster 2's concrete example of how a sector like utilities could underperform, highlights that a confluence of modest, non-shock events could still erode the existing YoY gain. This nuanced view of the downside risk warrants a small decrease in my probability from 92% to 91%.",
