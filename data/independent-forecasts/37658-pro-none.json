    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one and a half months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The merger agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel remains in effect but has not closed due to ongoing political opposition and regulatory reviews. No termination has been announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. regulatory review process (CFIUS and/or DOJ) does not reach a final, deal-killing conclusion before July 1, 2025. The companies, still formally committed to the merger, allow the deadline to pass without terminating the agreement, potentially extending it as they continue to navigate the challenges.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing a definitive negative outcome from the CFIUS or DOJ review, or concluding that the political and union opposition is insurmountable, one or both companies formally terminate the merger agreement and file the corresponding Form 8-K with the SEC before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant conflict between stated political will and the inertia of a major corporate transaction. The primary factor pushing towards a 'Yes' resolution is the explicit and sustained opposition from the highest levels of the U.S. government, including President Biden, as well as the United Steelworkers union. This political pressure makes a regulatory block, particularly from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a strong possibility. A definitive negative ruling from CFIUS would almost certainly trigger a termination before the July 1 deadline. However, the status quo is that the deal, while under pressure, is still active. Terminating a merger of this scale is a major step, and both parties have strong financial incentives to see the process through and exhaust all options. Regulatory reviews can be lengthy, and it is plausible that a final decision will not be rendered within the next ~45 days, allowing the deal to remain in a state of limbo past the deadline, resulting in a 'No' resolution. My research assistant provided no new information influencing this forecast. My probability is not higher because corporate and regulatory inertia is a powerful force; deals often survive in limbo for extended periods rather than being decisively killed. It is not lower because the political opposition is unusually direct and public, increasing the likelihood of a swift and conclusive regulatory rejection before the deadline. I would raise my probability upon credible reports of a forthcoming negative decision from CFIUS or the DOJ. I would lower my probability if the companies and regulators were to agree on an extended timeline for review that goes well beyond July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
