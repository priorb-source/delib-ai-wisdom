    "review": "Both forecasters present well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my initial thinking. Forecaster 2's emphasis on needing globally exceptional conditions (not just regional heat) is a crucial point that tempers overconfidence from European heat records alone. Forecaster 3's explicit documentation of early 2025 momentum (3 of 4 months in top 2 positions) is more compelling than I initially weighted. However, I believe Forecaster 2's 45% forecast underweights two critical factors: (1) the ENSO transition from El Niño to neutral is a substantial headwind, as both 2020 and 2016 May records occurred during El Niño phases, and (2) April's moderation to only second warmest suggests the peak warming phase may be declining. Forecaster 3's 38% strikes a more balanced middle ground, though I still think the neutral ENSO deserves slightly more weight as a negative factor.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 32% to 36%. The key factors influencing this update are: (1) Forecaster 3's explicit framing of early 2025 momentum is more compelling than my initial assessment—having 3 of the first 4 months rank in the top 2 positions is genuinely exceptional and suggests systemic warmth rather than random variation. (2) The multiple May heat records across different European regions (UK, Scotland, France) indicate more widespread warmth than I initially credited, reducing concerns about purely isolated events. However, I'm not updating as high as the other forecasters because: (1) The April moderation remains a significant warning signal that the peak warming may be passing. (2) The ENSO transition to neutral is a major headwind that I believe deserves substantial weight—both previous May records (2020, 2016) occurred with El Niño boosts. (3) The +0.95°C bar from May 2020 is exceptionally high, and the Indian cooling demonstrates meaningful regional heterogeneity. (4) The base rate strongly favors No—most months don't break all-time records even in a warming climate. My 36% forecast reflects meaningful probability above the base rate due to exceptional 2025 momentum, but maintains skepticism given neutral ENSO conditions and the extraordinarily high threshold.",
