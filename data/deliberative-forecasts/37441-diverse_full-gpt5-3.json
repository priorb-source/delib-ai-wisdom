    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the short window and large magnitude required, making the status-quo outcome No. They also note that a “touch” suffices, which modestly increases odds versus requiring a close. However, I find their 18% too high. Points that make me skeptical: (1) ECB is widely expected to cut in June, which is typically EUR-negative; (2) trade-war escalation with the EU is more likely to be USD-supportive via risk-off in the near term; (3) seasonality cited (May weakness for EUR/USD) actually leans against a rapid EUR surge; (4) the move required (~9–10% in ≈7 weeks) is a tail event for G10 FX. They don’t reconcile these with such a high probability. They also do not incorporate a volatility-based base-rate anchor: with 2-month implied/realized vol in the high single digits annualized, a 9–10% move is a ~2.5–3+ sigma tail. Even accounting for barrier-touch and macro shocks, 18% appears overstated.",
    "rationale": "Starting point ~0.884 USD/EUR (EUR/USD ~1.13–1.15). Threshold requires EUR/USD ≥1.25 within May 12–June 30 (~7 weeks). Using typical 1–2 month vol for EUR/USD (≈7–9% annualized), the 2‑month sigma is ~2.9–3.7%. A 9–10% appreciation in that horizon is ~2.5–3+ sigma—an unconditional tail in the low single digits. Barrier-touch across the window raises the chance somewhat, but still leaves it firmly in tail territory. Macro setup does not obviously skew the tail toward Yes: the ECB is likely to cut in June; the Fed cutting before July is not base case (only ~1/3 priced); US data are mixed rather than collapsing; trade-policy shocks are more likely to boost the USD near-term via risk-off; and EUR-positive fiscal surprises of the necessary size/timing are uncertain. Technicals (resistance near ~1.15) imply the pair must first break and extend meaningfully to trigger momentum toward 1.20–1.22 before 1.25 even comes into play. I already accounted for the “touch” resolution and tail catalysts (e.g., sudden dovish Fed pivot, sharp US data deterioration, or a large EU fiscal shock). The deliberation did not introduce new information that materially shifts probabilities. Therefore I retain a low, non-zero tail estimate.",
