    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduced concrete, time-stamped evidence I hadn’t explicitly integrated: as of Mar 23, 2025, services were reportedly on hold pending data interception guarantees, with talks at a preliminary stage. That’s a meaningful negative update because lawful intercept/monitoring arrangements often take weeks-to-months to finalize and validate. Forecaster 3 highlighted the ‘dashboard system’ requirement and the missed April launch window, while noting TRCSL denied suspension rumors—useful nuance indicating the project isn’t dead, just delayed.\n\nI find F2’s emphasis on the compressed timeline and the nature of the blocker (security/interception) compelling; such requirements can be thorny and sequential (agreement → technical implementation/testing → regulatory sign-off → commercial go-live → map update). F3’s argument that this is a technical/regulatory detail rather than a fundamental deal-breaker is fair, but the recent slip from an expected April launch, plus the “preliminary” status in late March, makes a June resolution less likely. Thus, I weight F2’s caution more than F3’s optimism, but not as low as 12% because the license remains active, Sri Lanka could accept a software-based monitoring interface, and Starlink can move quickly once cleared.\n",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. Status quo on the Starlink map remains No. New details about a hold pending lawful intercept/dashboard requirements and talks being preliminary as of late March materially reduce the near-term odds. Even if an agreement were reached in late May, there would still be nontrivial work to implement, validate, and secure approvals before flipping the site to “Available.” The missed April target is a negative momentum signal.\n\nCountervailing positives: license was granted in 2024; TRCSL denied suspension rumors; the requirement appears to be compliance/monitoring rather than a fundamental ban; Starlink can update availability quickly once authorized. The resolution only needs “anywhere” in Sri Lanka to be available. However, without concrete signs of resolution (e.g., finalized LI/dashboard agreement, type approval/import clearance, or official launch notice), base rates on compliance-driven delays suggest slippage beyond July 1 is more likely than a rapid wrap-up.\n\nNet: I’m moving down from 40% to reflect the specific and recent regulatory-security blocker and the short runway, but I’m staying above Forecaster 2’s 12% given the intact license and Starlink’s capacity to execute quickly if political will aligns.\n",
