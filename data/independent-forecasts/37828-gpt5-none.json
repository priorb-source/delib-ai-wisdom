    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling continues operating privately through June, makes no post on its news page about an IPO, and does not appear on EDGAR with a public S-1 before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rippling either publicly files an S-1 on EDGAR in late May or June, or posts on its company blog/news page that it is planning an IPO (for example, accompanying a public S-1 filing).",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and timing: With roughly six weeks left, the prior for any single late‑stage private tech company to file a public S-1 in a given month is low. Companies often target fall windows; summer filings happen but are less common. Filing and announcing within this narrow window would typically require clear preexisting signals, which are absent here.\n- Resolution mechanics: The question resolves Yes only via (1) a public S-1 on EDGAR or (2) an announcement on Rippling’s own news page. Most companies do not proactively announce they are “planning an IPO” on their blog ahead of a public S-1 due to quiet‑period considerations. Thus, the blog path is unlikely unless tied to a public S-1.\n- Current signals: The provided background (secondary market strength) suggests improving sentiment but is a weak predictor for a public S-1 within a few weeks. There’s no cited press indicating a confidential filing, underwriter lineup, or imminent timetable. My research assistant provided no additional information, which I interpret as no strong, recent public signals of an imminent filing.\n- Why not higher: Lack of concrete IPO pipeline indicators; seasonality (late spring/early summer); and the tendency for high‑profile issuers to avoid pre‑S‑1 announcements.\n- Why not lower: The IPO window is more open than in 2022–2023; Rippling is a scaled, high‑profile candidate that could choose to move quickly, and a surprise late‑June S‑1 is not impossible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a confidential submission; hiring or disclosures consistent with IPO prep (e.g., underwriter mandates, SOX-readiness hires), or a sudden EDGAR S‑1 appearance. A strong wave of comp IPOs executing well in June could also raise odds.\n- What would move me down: Market risk‑off turn, negative company‑specific news, or reports that Rippling plans further private rounds/secondaries or targets a fall/winter timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
