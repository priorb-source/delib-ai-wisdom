    "review": "Forecaster 2 contributes a useful angle: both leaders have slid since January and Sheinbaum’s decline may have been steeper through April, which, if sustained, would slightly favor Milei. They also correctly note the short horizon and status quo dynamics. However, they seem to underweight the tie-as-No rule and the fact that a 1-point edge is well within normal MC tracker noise. Given that even a tie resolves to No, a near coin-flip should lean below 50, not above. \n\nForecaster 3’s analysis hinges on a 76% approval for Sheinbaum and treats that as the relevant benchmark. That figure is inconsistent with the baseline presented (MC had Sheinbaum ~60, Milei ~61 at the time) and, more importantly, the resolution hinges exclusively on Morning Consult. Without MC evidence of Sheinbaum at ~76%, this argument is not persuasive and likely draws from a different polling source that doesn’t govern resolution.\n\nNet: Forecaster 2 offers a modest upward nudge (recent relative momentum), but Forecaster 3’s key premise is not applicable. I still place more weight on (a) the tie-as-No asymmetry, (b) Argentine polling indicating softening for Milei (D’Alessio IROL/Berensztein net -8 in late April), and (c) the tendency for MC approval to move within a narrow band where a 1-point edge can easily evaporate by late June.",
    "rationale": "Resolution mechanics and base rates dominate. The current MC gap is 1 point (Milei 61, Sheinbaum 60). Over a ~6-week window, MC week-to-week variation and small drifts can flip such a margin, and any tie resolves as No. Argentina-specific signals point to mild downside risk for Milei (late-April non-MC polling shows net image turning negative and perceptions of a worse economy). Mexico’s early-term dynamic likely keeps Sheinbaum around ~60 absent a shock. \n\nForecaster 2’s point about Sheinbaum’s steeper January–April decline is a valid counterweight, but I discount it somewhat: (i) declines off a honeymoon can stabilize; (ii) a 1-point lead is not robust on MC; and (iii) the tie penalty biases the fair odds downward even if this were a toss-up. Forecaster 3’s 76% claim is not relevant to Morning Consult and thus does not change my view. \n\nBottom line: I still see slightly better-than-even odds that by late June Sheinbaum ≥ Milei on MC, via either a tie or a small Sheinbaum lead, while a sustained Milei edge is somewhat less likely. I keep my forecast unchanged.",
