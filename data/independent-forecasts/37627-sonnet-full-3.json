  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days remain until June 15, 2025. The outcome could be known at any point during this window if a phone call occurs and is publicly acknowledged by both parties.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - they will speak on the phone",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy meet in person at the Istanbul talks on May 15 or other venues, communicate exclusively through intermediaries or written channels, or diplomatic momentum stalls and they have no need for direct communication during this specific 33-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given the active peace negotiations and established pattern of regular phone calls, Trump and Zelenskyy have a follow-up call to discuss outcomes of the Istanbul talks, coordinate positions before or after Trump meets with Putin, or address developments in the ceasefire negotiations. This could happen during coordination around May 15 talks or any point in the following weeks.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests a Yes outcome. Trump and Zelenskyy have established a pattern of regular phone communication in 2025, speaking on February 12, March 19, and most recently May 10 - roughly every 3-4 weeks. We are currently in an intense period of diplomatic activity with Istanbul peace talks scheduled for May 15, ongoing ceasefire negotiations, and active coordination between Ukraine, the US, and European powers. The 33-day window from May 13 to June 15 is substantial - more than enough time for another call given their recent frequency of communication. The last call was only 3 days ago, suggesting we're in a particularly active phase of diplomacy where frequent communication is likely. Historical context from their relationship shows they do communicate directly during critical moments. However, I'm not assigning an extremely high probability (90%+) for several reasons: (1) they might meet in person at Istanbul or another venue, satisfying communication needs without a phone call; (2) Trump's busy travel schedule could create coordination challenges; (3) the specific definition requires both parties to acknowledge the call publicly, which might not always happen with sensitive diplomatic conversations; (4) they could use other communication channels like secure video conferences or intermediaries. For my forecast to move higher (85%+), I would need to see: continued diplomatic intensity requiring coordination, Trump unable to attend Istanbul in person, or reports of scheduled calls. For it to move lower (60% or below), I would need: successful in-person meeting that resolves key issues, breakdown in diplomatic relations, or a shift to communication through other officials rather than principals.",
