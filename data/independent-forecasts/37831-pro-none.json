    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 1 week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Mali does not reverse its decision, and the ban on political parties remains in effect past the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The military junta, led by Assimi Goïta, maintains the decree dissolving political parties. The government ignores muted international criticism and low-level domestic dissent, proceeding with its transition plan without the participation of established political organizations, thus consolidating its power.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of intense, coordinated pressure from regional bodies like ECOWAS (threatening immediate, severe economic sanctions) and significant domestic unrest from a unified front of civil society and labor unions forces the junta to view the ban as a liability. To quell instability and avoid further international isolation, the government announces a reversal of the decree as a concession.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high inertia of the current political trajectory in Mali. The military junta has consistently consolidated power since 2021, pushing back election timelines and suppressing opposition. The dissolution of political parties is the most drastic step in this process and signals a clear intent to eliminate organized opposition, not to engage with it. Reversing such a fundamental decree in just over a month would be a significant admission of weakness, which authoritarian regimes assiduously avoid. The short timeframe is crucial; it is insufficient for external pressure, like sanctions, to take full effect or for a durable and powerful domestic opposition movement to organize and challenge the state's security apparatus effectively. The status quo, in which the ban remains, is the path of least resistance for the junta and aligns with their established pattern of behavior.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the ban is an extreme measure that could backfire. There is a small but non-zero chance of a 'black swan' event, such as a major schism within the ruling military elite or a sudden, severe economic crisis that triggers widespread, unmanageable protests, forcing the government's hand.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there is no current evidence of the kind of overwhelming internal or external pressure required to force such a rapid and humbling reversal. The junta has previously shown resilience to sanctions by pivoting to other international partners. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon seeing credible reports of large-scale, sustained protests in Bamako, a public split within the military leadership, or an imminent and crippling ultimatum from key regional powers. I would decrease it if the junta doubles down by arresting more political figures without significant public backlash or announces a new constitutional framework based on a non-party system.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
