    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be definitively known by July 1, 2025, which is 33 days from today. The qualifying period for a Yes outcome is June 1-30, 2025, starting in just 3 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if nothing changes and no country signs during the specific month of June 2025, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing negotiations with potential signatory countries extend beyond June into July or later. Countries considering signing may be waiting for domestic legislative processes, political events, or coordination with space program milestones that don't align with June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more countries complete negotiations and sign the Artemis Accords during June 2025. This could include countries already in advanced discussions with the U.S. State Department, or nations aligning their signing with relevant national space policy announcements or international events occurring in June.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is the recent signing momentum: Bangladesh signed April 8, 2025, and Norway signed May 15, 2025 - that's 2 countries in roughly 5 weeks. This suggests active diplomatic engagement and recruitment efforts. Historically, with 55 signatories over approximately 5 years since 2020, the average rate is about 11 per year or roughly 0.9 per month. The recent pace appears slightly elevated above this baseline. Factors supporting a Yes outcome include: (1) demonstrated recent momentum, (2) many potential signatories remain among the ~140 non-signatory UN members, and (3) continued U.S. diplomatic efforts to expand the accords. Factors supporting No include: (1) the requirement for signing within a specific 30-day window is restrictive, (2) diplomatic agreements don't follow predictable monthly schedules and often cluster around events or political calendars, and (3) many obvious candidates (major space-faring nations, close U.S. allies) have already signed. My forecast is not higher because requiring a signing in exactly June 2025 (rather than 'soon') introduces substantial timing uncertainty, and diplomatic processes are inherently unpredictable in their exact timing. It's not lower because the recent evidence shows active momentum, and the base rate of roughly one signing per month suggests better-than-even odds for any given month during an active period. To update upward, I would need evidence of scheduled diplomatic events in June, public statements about imminent signings, or information about countries in final negotiation stages. To update downward, I would need evidence that recent signatories represented the completion of a specific recruitment push, or information suggesting potential signatories are waiting for later dates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
