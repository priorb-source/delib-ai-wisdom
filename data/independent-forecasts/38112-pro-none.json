    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, with the summit scheduled for July 6-7, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new countries are invited to join BRICS as full members. The group's membership size remains unchanged as the bloc focuses on integrating the members who joined in 2024 and 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 17th BRICS Summit concludes with discussions on deepening economic and political cooperation among the current members. The host nation, Brazil, along with other members like India, successfully argues for a period of consolidation to fully integrate recent new members. While the interest of numerous countries is acknowledged, the members fail to reach a unanimous consensus on any specific candidate, and thus no new invitations for full membership are extended.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the momentum from the recent expansions and the precedent of upgrading Indonesia from partner to full member, the BRICS leaders reach a consensus to invite at least one more country. A strategically important partner nation, such as Kazakhstan or Nigeria, is officially invited to become a full member during the summit, further expanding the bloc's geopolitical and economic footprint.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances the strong recent momentum for BRICS expansion against the institutional need for consolidation and the likely cautious stance of the host nation, Brazil. The probability is set at 40%, indicating that while no new invitation is the more likely outcome, there is a substantial chance of at least one invitation being extended.\n\nArguments for a 'No' outcome (60% likelihood) are compelling. Firstly, the bloc has just undergone a major expansion, nearly doubling its membership. Typically, such organizations require a period of consolidation to integrate new members and streamline decision-making processes. Secondly, the host, Brazil, has historically been more cautious about rapid expansion compared to members like China and Russia. It may use its influence to prioritize deepening existing ties over adding more members. Finally, the requirement for unanimous consent among all eleven members presents a high bar; any single member's objection can block a potential candidate.\n\nHowever, the arguments for a 'Yes' outcome (40% likelihood) are also significant. A clear precedent now exists for upgrading countries from the 'partner' status to full membership, as seen with Indonesia in early 2025. This creates a clear pipeline and expectation for further growth. Key members, particularly China and Russia, view expansion as a strategic imperative to build a counterweight to Western-led institutions and may push hard for it. Inviting just one or two new members could be framed as a manageable continuation of this policy rather than another disruptive large-scale expansion. The existence of a list of official partner countries provides a ready-made pool of vetted candidates to choose from.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 40% because the geopolitical drive for expansion remains strong, and the recent precedent with Indonesia makes it very plausible that at least one partner will be elevated. It is not higher than 40% because the status quo (no new members) is a powerful default, especially given the high bar of unanimity and the likely preference of the host nation for a period of consolidation. \n\nI would increase the probability following official statements from Brazilian or Indian officials in support of further expansion at this summit, or credible reports of a consensus forming around a specific candidate. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if officials emphasize the need for consolidation or if reports emerge of disagreements over potential new members.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
