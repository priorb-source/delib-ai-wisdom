    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial 7% forecast. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I underweighted: the 2022 precedent where the Scottish Government did announce a referendum date despite legal uncertainty. However, both forecasters correctly note that this strategy failed and is unlikely to be repeated immediately. The emphasis on the extremely compressed timeline is persuasive - with the by-election guidance period (May 15-June 5) and council workers strike ballot (closing June 12), the effective window for an announcement is only mid-to-late June, roughly 3-4 weeks. Both forecasters also convincingly argue that the lack of any preparatory signals, legislative groundwork, or public hints makes an announcement highly improbable. The April 2025 focus on domestic priorities and Sturgeon's explicit 'off the radar until 2030s' statement are stronger indicators than I initially credited. The strategic orientation toward 2026 elections as the next major milestone is well-evidenced.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my original 7% forecast overweighted the possibility of political surprises and underweighted the severity of time constraints and the absence of preparatory signals. The effective announcement window is only 3-4 weeks given practical constraints. While the 2022 precedent shows willingness to make symbolic announcements despite legal barriers, repeating a failed strategy so soon seems unlikely without any new signals or changed circumstances. The confluence of factors - Supreme Court ruling, UK government opposition, recent focus on domestic priorities, Sturgeon's explicit statement, strategic focus on 2026, and critically short timeline - all point to a lower probability. However, I maintain that the probability should not drop below 3% because: (1) the question only requires an announcement, not implementation; (2) Swinney did call independence an 'urgent priority'; (3) a symbolic political gambit cannot be entirely ruled out; (4) the remaining June window, while short, exists. I'm updating to 5%, aligning with Forecaster 3's reasoning, which appropriately balances the very low likelihood against residual political unpredictability.",
