    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Viennese state election is scheduled for autumn 2025, likely October or November. With today being April 21, 2025, there are approximately 5-7 months until the outcome is known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The SPÖ (Social Democratic Party of Austria) winning the most seats. Vienna has been a stronghold of the SPÖ for decades, with the party continuously leading the city government and winning the plurality of seats in previous elections, including the 2020 election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A scenario where the FPÖ (Freedom Party) or ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) capitalizes on national political trends and manages to win more seats than the SPÖ. This could occur if there is a significant shift in voter sentiment, major scandals affecting the SPÖ, or effective campaigning by opposition parties that resonates with Viennese voters on issues like immigration, housing costs, or urban governance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains its historical dominance in Vienna by effectively addressing local concerns and retaining its traditional voter base. Vienna's more progressive and urban electorate continues to support social democratic policies, and the party successfully defends against challenges from other parties, securing the plurality of seats as it has done consistently over many decades.",
    "rationale": "Vienna has been an SPÖ stronghold for generations, with the party dominating city politics since World War II. This creates a very strong status quo bias toward an SPÖ plurality victory. While national trends in Austria have shown gains for the FPÖ in recent years, Vienna tends to be significantly more left-leaning than the rest of Austria due to its urban, diverse, and educated population. The reference to polling from March 24, 2025 suggests recent data exists, though specific numbers weren't provided. Without evidence of a dramatic shift in polling, the historical pattern strongly favors the SPÖ. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 85-90%) because: Austria has seen significant political volatility nationally, the FPÖ has made gains across the country, and there's still 5-7 months for the campaign to unfold. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 50-60%) because: Vienna's consistent SPÖ voting pattern is remarkably stable, there's no indication of a major collapse in SPÖ support, and it would require a historically unprecedented shift for the SPÖ to lose its plurality in Vienna. I would update higher if: polling consistently shows the SPÖ with a strong 10+ point lead, or if the campaign reveals major weaknesses in opposition parties. I would update lower if: polling shows the SPÖ and another party in a statistical tie, or if major scandals or crises affect the SPÖ's standing.",
