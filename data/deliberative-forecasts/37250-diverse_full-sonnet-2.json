    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that are more pessimistic than mine (4% and 5% vs my 10%). Their key insights that I underweighted: (1) Forecaster 3's emphasis on the practical logistics of extracting someone from a Salvadoran maximum-security prison - even with cooperation, travel documents, transfers, and transport take time; (2) Both forecasters stress more heavily that this requires compelling a foreign government with physical custody, not just domestic compliance; (3) Forecaster 3's point that El Salvador might 'expel to shift responsibility' is intriguing but still requires Bukele reversing his public 'will not be released' stance. I also appreciate Forecaster 3's explicit acknowledgment that the question only requires Garcia to enter U.S. territory once, not remain - though this doesn't significantly change the calculus since the barriers are primarily about getting him out of El Salvador, not keeping him in the U.S.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm convinced my 10% was too optimistic. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that we're not just dealing with U.S. executive resistance (which courts could theoretically overcome through contempt proceedings), but with a foreign leader who has physical custody and has made explicit public commitments. Bukele calling Garcia a 'terrorist' and stating he 'will not be released or returned' is an extremely difficult position to reverse within 2 months. The logistical challenges - transfer from maximum security, travel documents, coordination between two resistant governments - compound the time constraint. However, I don't want to go as low as 4% because: the unanimous Supreme Court ruling remains extraordinarily powerful legal pressure; Judge Xinis continues active monitoring; the U.S. does possess significant leverage over El Salvador through aid and diplomatic channels; and unforeseen developments remain possible in 2 months. The path exists but requires multiple unlikely developments in sequence: court escalation that forces U.S. executive action, U.S. applying effective pressure on El Salvador, Bukele finding a face-saving way to reverse course, and rapid logistics execution. This combination justifies a low but non-trivial probability.",
