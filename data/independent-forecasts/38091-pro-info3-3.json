  "information": "As of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No country will sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 passes without any official signing ceremony for a new country joining the Artemis Accords. Diplomatic outreach and negotiations with potential signatories continue, but no country finalizes its accession within the specified timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A nation that has been in advanced, private negotiations with the United States finalizes its internal approvals and a signing ceremony is announced and held between June 1 and June 30, 2025. This could be driven by a desire to align with US space policy ahead of a major international forum or to gain access to collaborative opportunities.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the status quo and the lack of specific, public evidence for a signing in June 2025. The research assistant's report notes there have been no public announcements of an impending signing, which is a strong indicator for a 'No' outcome in this short timeframe, as these events typically involve logistical and diplomatic preparations that are often signaled in advance. This establishes 'No' as the most likely outcome. However, the probability is not close to zero due to the consistent rate of new signatories. The Accords have seen steady growth, with approximately 8-10 new members per year since 2021. The recent signings by Bangladesh (April 2025) and Norway (May 2025) demonstrate significant current momentum. This historical and recent cadence suggests the diplomatic pipeline is active and a signing in any given month is plausible. The competing China-Russia ILRS project is a relevant background factor in the broader geopolitical landscape but is unlikely to be a decisive factor for a signing within the specific one-month window of June 2025. My forecast of 30% balances the strong negative signal (no announcement) against the positive signal of the recent signing rate. The forecast is not higher because without a specific candidate country being discussed publicly, a signing remains speculative. It is not lower because the pace of one signatory per month over the last two months makes a 'surprise' signing entirely plausible. I would increase my forecast significantly upon any credible news or rumor of a specific country planning a June signing. Conversely, I would lower it if mid-June passes with no such news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June.

The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
