    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I are in strong agreement, arriving at nearly identical probabilities (4-5%) based on similar reasoning: the very short timeframe (around five weeks), the strict requirement for the exact phrase 'diversity visa', and the low base rate of either individual discussing this niche topic. Forecaster 2 adds a valuable piece of evidence I hadn't explicitly considered: Trump and Musk's current immigration discourse is actively focused on other programs like the 'Gold Card' and H-1B visas, which makes the Diversity Visa program even less likely to be a priority. In contrast, Forecaster 3's reasoning is based on a fundamental misreading of the timeline. Their forecast of 28% is predicated on a '13-month timeframe' that includes the 'volatile election period.' However, the prompt clearly states today's date is May 22, 2025, meaning the election is over and only about five weeks remain until the resolution date. Their entire rationale is therefore invalid in the context of the question, and I will disregard their analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the short remaining timeframe and the low probability of either Trump or Musk tweeting the specific phrase 'diversity visa'. The intelligence report noting Musk's withdrawal from politics and Trump's focus on other matters already suggested a low probability. The deliberation with other forecasters has reinforced and slightly strengthened this view. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning highly convincing, particularly their point that the current immigration focus for the Trump administration is on other programs. This isn't just a neutral absence of discussion about the Diversity Visa; it's an environment where other, specific immigration topics are actively crowding it out. This makes a spontaneous pivot to this very specific program in the next five weeks even less likely. Forecaster 3's analysis was unpersuasive as it was based on an incorrect understanding of the time remaining. Consequently, the additional evidence provided by Forecaster 2 strengthens the case for a 'No' outcome. I am updating my forecast downward slightly to reflect this increased confidence.",
