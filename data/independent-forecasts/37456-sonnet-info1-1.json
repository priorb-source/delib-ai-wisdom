  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days remain until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, so there will be roughly 95 days total between the recall date and the resolution deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active past July 1, 2025 because Cargill and FSIS need additional time to complete the investigation, verify corrective actions, ensure all contaminated products are retrieved or accounted for, and address the root cause of the sodium hypochlorite contamination. The widespread distribution and long shelf lives of the products (some extending to March 2026) complicate tracking and retrieval efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill efficiently retrieves or accounts for the recalled products, completes its investigation into how cleaning solution contaminated the liquid eggs, implements satisfactory corrective actions to prevent recurrence, and FSIS reviews and approves the company's response quickly enough to change the status from Active to Closed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall has been active for approximately 40 days (since March 28, 2025) with 55 days remaining until the July 1 deadline. This provides roughly 95 days total - a timeframe that represents the shorter end of typical USDA/FSIS recall closure periods. Several factors suggest the status quo (remaining Active) is more likely: First, chemical contamination with an unapproved substance like sodium hypochlorite typically requires extensive investigation and verification of corrective actions. Second, the recall involves significant volume (212,268 pounds) distributed across multiple states including Ohio, Texas, and foodservice channels in at least six other states with potential nationwide reach. Third, the affected products have extended shelf lives (use-by dates extending to March 2026), which complicates retrieval efforts as products may be deeply embedded in distribution channels or consumer possession. Fourth, FSIS Class I recalls (which this likely is, given the health hazard) often take 3-6 months or longer to close. However, factors supporting a faster resolution include Cargill's status as a major food company with substantial resources and recall management expertise, and the fact that the contamination was identified relatively early and the recall was issued promptly. The 95-day window, while tight, is not impossible for a well-executed recall response. My forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo since the recall has already consumed 40% of the available time while remaining Active, and most recalls of this complexity extend beyond three months. I would revise my forecast upward if news emerged about rapid product retrieval progress or preliminary FSIS approval of corrective actions. I would revise downward if complications arose such as additional contaminated batches being discovered or delays in implementing corrective measures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
