    "review": "Both other forecasters assigned a higher probability to a change than my initial 5%, and I found their reasoning compelling. They correctly pointed out that while there are no immediate signals for a change, the historical base rate for modifications to the black list is not negligible. Forecaster 3's analysis, which implicitly pointed to a historical frequency of changes around once every 7-9 plenaries (or roughly 11-14% per plenary), was particularly convincing. Forecaster 2's jump to 20% felt less grounded, but the general direction of their argument—that 5% might be too low given the possibility of surprises in an opaque process—was valid. Both made me reconsider the weight I placed on the lack of immediate public signals versus the background probability derived from historical precedent.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 5% to 10%. My initial analysis was heavily anchored on the short timeframe and the absence of any specific, credible information suggesting an imminent change for any jurisdiction. However, the other forecasters rightly emphasized the importance of the historical base rate of change for the black list. Upon reflection and a quick review of the list's history, a change occurring at any given plenary, while uncommon, happens with a frequency that suggests a probability in the low double-digits is more appropriate than 5%. My initial forecast was likely overconfident in the status quo. I am increasing my probability to 10% to better incorporate this base rate uncertainty. This balances the extremely high likelihood of no change based on current information (removals are nearly impossible, no additions are publicly signaled) with the historical fact that unexpected changes—primarily additions via escalation from the grey list—do occur.",
