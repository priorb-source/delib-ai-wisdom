    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on “status quo” but provides no live-standings evidence to justify a very high 65% on a single named team. Their logic also contains a contradiction (downward update if Rockies suffer injuries would, if anything, increase the chance of being worst). Emphasizing organizational dysfunction is relevant to true-talent but doesn’t overcome the combinatorial fact that several teams contend for worst at any snapshot. Forecaster 3’s framing matches my prior: mid‑June volatility remains material, there are typically multiple bottom-tier teams, and “lowest on a specific date” is a narrow target. The tie-resolves-Yes note and the recognition that 3–5 teams are plausible are important and consistent with a modest probability.\n\nNet: F2’s argument doesn’t add concrete evidence and appears overconfident. F3’s analysis reinforces my initial view. I make only a slight upward tweak to reflect short-horizon persistence and tie-as-Yes framing.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~4 weeks (~25–28 games). Without current standings, the rational baseline for a single team being worst on a specific date sits near an equal split among the bottom cohort (roughly 4–6 teams), i.e., ~17–25%. The Rockies likely belong in that cohort and may merit a small premium on true talent, but absent proof they are already clearly last by a meaningful margin, pushing beyond ~25–30% is hard to justify. Tie counting as Yes adds a bit. Forecaster 2’s 65% would require evidence of a current sizeable gap or a very weak competitive set, neither of which is provided. Forecaster 3’s reasoning aligns with base-rate logic and mid‑June volatility. Given these considerations, I nudge slightly up from my prior to reflect short-horizon persistence but remain well below 30%.",
