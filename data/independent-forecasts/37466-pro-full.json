  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Under two months, with a resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The map on the specified WorldAtlas.com page continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico', so the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com, a Canadian company, decides to adhere to the long-standing, internationally recognized name 'Gulf of Mexico' for its primary maps to maintain neutrality in a political dispute and align with international hydrographic standards.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To reflect the new official designation used by U.S. government agencies, WorldAtlas.com updates the map on its North America page to include the name 'Gulf of America', possibly in a dual-name format like 'Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)', before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a balance between strong institutional inertia and specific actions already taken by WorldAtlas.com. The default expectation, or status quo, is for the name to remain 'Gulf of Mexico'. This name has centuries of historical precedent and remains the international standard, which a Canadian-based publisher would typically favor. However, two key factors significantly increase the probability of a 'Yes' resolution. First, the resolution criteria are broad: a dual naming like 'Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico' qualifies. This is a much lower bar than a complete replacement. Second, and most importantly, WorldAtlas.com has already demonstrated a willingness to use the new name by titling its specific article on the subject 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'. This action signals that the organization is aware of and responsive to the change, and has an established format for acknowledging both names. It is plausible they will extend this existing format to their main maps to cater to their U.S. audience, similar to how Google Maps has updated its service for U.S. users. The probability is not higher because updating map graphics can be a slower process than updating article text, and the company may feel the article title is sufficient acknowledgement, choosing to avoid the controversial change on its primary map. The probability is not lower because the precedent set by the article title is a very strong signal of intent, and the path of adding a parenthetical name is a low-cost, low-commitment way to appear current to a significant portion of their user base. I would increase my forecast if other major international publishers like National Geographic make the change, and decrease it if the deadline grows near with no update.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
