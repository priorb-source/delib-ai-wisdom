    "review": "All three forecasters acknowledge the critical handicap of lacking baseline data from January 2025 Morning Consult ratings. Forecaster 3 provides valuable historical context that I underweighted: Erdoğan has typically maintained approval in the 40-55% range while Sánchez has been in the 30-45% range. This historical pattern is significant - it suggests Erdoğan has more often had higher approval ratings than Sánchez. Both Forecasters 2 and 3 converged on forecasts near or below 50%, reflecting appropriate uncertainty but with a slight lean toward Erdoğan maintaining higher approval. My original 55% forecast now appears too optimistic about Sánchez given: (1) the historical data suggesting Erdoğan typically leads, (2) the extreme uncertainty from lack of current standings, and (3) Erdoğan's demonstrated resilience despite Turkey's economic challenges. While I correctly identified Turkey's structural economic problems as a headwind for Erdoğan, I failed to adequately account for the base rate from historical patterns. The other forecasters' more conservative stance is warranted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted my qualitative assessment of Turkey's economic challenges and underweighted the historical base rate. Without knowing current standings, the appropriate prior should lean toward the historical pattern where Erdoğan has typically maintained higher approval ratings than Sánchez. The 33-day timeframe makes significant shifts unlikely, so whatever the status quo relationship is will likely persist. Given the historical tendency for Erdoğan to have higher approval, the probability that Sánchez has higher approval should be below 50%. However, I won't go as low as 42% because: (1) Turkey's economic difficulties are real and ongoing, (2) European political systems and economies have been more stable, and (3) there's genuine uncertainty about whether recent patterns match historical ones. My updated forecast of 47% reflects appropriate humility about the lack of data while incorporating the historical base rate favoring Erdoğan.",
