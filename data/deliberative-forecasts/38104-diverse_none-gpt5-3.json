    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a fair point about the time remaining and multi-agency pressure, but I’m not persuaded that an early 3/10 recapture rate implies a 60% chance of a clean sweep by July 1. Early arrests are usually the easiest; the remaining set tends to be harder and the hazard of capture declines. Forecaster 3’s framing aligns more with base-rate expectations for group escapes: it’s common for at least one person to remain at large beyond a month, making the “all 10” requirement a high bar. I didn’t see new factual updates beyond May 19; both rely on general patterns. The main addition I take from the discussion is to slightly reweight the month-long window and coordination benefits (US Marshals, political pressure), which could accelerate captures if recent leads exist or if arrests cascade.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~32 days from the deadline and already ~2 weeks past the escape. The requirement that all 10 be recaptured or killed is stringent; even one holdout yields No. Base rates suggest early captures are common and later ones slow, with a meaningful chance that 1–2 remain at large for months. On the other hand, the urban setting, publicity, and multi-agency effort could produce correlated arrests if a network is rolled up. Without evidence that the at-large count has already fallen well below seven, the median outcome remains that at least one person is still missing by July 1. I’m nudging my forecast up slightly to reflect the time left and potential for cascading leads, but I remain below 50% because of the high bar and tail risk of a last holdout.",
