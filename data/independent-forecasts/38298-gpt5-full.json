  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–20 days (NOAA typically updates Climate at a Glance and publishes the May Global Climate Report in mid-June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent months have been record- or near-record warm, and exceptionally high global sea-surface temperatures are persisting into mid-2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 ranks 2nd (or lower) because land temperatures came in a bit cooler than 2024/2020 while ENSO has faded to neutral, leaving May 2024 or May 2020 marginally ahead in NOAA’s Land+Ocean dataset.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Global SSTs remain at or near record-high May values and land temperatures are broadly above average (Europe/US heat outweighs regional cool anomalies like India), yielding a NOAA rank of 1st warmest for May 2025.",
    "rationale": "Signal: The assistant reports that 2025 to date has been exceptionally warm in NOAA’s framework: January was the hottest January, March was 1st or tied for 1st, and April was 2nd warmest. That implies May is likely to be in the top tier as well. Even with ENSO transitioning to neutral, the background forcing from very warm global oceans remains unusually strong and is a dominant driver of the global mean. Numerous independent indicators and reports through spring 2025 point to persistent, record-level sea surface temperatures, which tend to keep monthly global Land+Ocean means elevated. Regional anecdotes for May are mixed (notably cool/rainy India, but widespread European and parts of U.S. warmth); globally, the ocean carries more weight than any one land region.\nStatus quo weighting: Over the past year+, many consecutive months have been record-warm in multiple datasets. Given that inertia and the still-elevated SSTs, the default/“do nothing changes” expectation is another top-1 or top-2 result. That said, April being 2nd warmest shows that breaking the record is no longer automatic as El Niño wanes.\nWhy not higher than my forecast: ENSO has faded to neutral, reducing the tailwind versus the 2023–24 peak. India’s unusual May cool anomaly and any other regional cool spells could shave a few hundredths of a degree off the global average. Also, NOAA’s dataset specifics and baselines sometimes rank months slightly differently than other reanalyses; if May 2024 (or 2020) was particularly strong in NOAA’s Land+Ocean, surpassing it may be tight.\nWhy not lower: Oceans remain extraordinarily warm relative to the 20th-century baseline that NOAA uses. Early-2025 months already hit 1st or 2nd in rank, suggesting that only a modest additional push is needed for May to claim #1. Late-May European heat and continued warmth in North America add to the land component.\nUpdates that would move my view: Upward if ERA5/GISTEMP post May 2025 as decisively the warmest May or if preliminary NOAA global SST anomalies for May are record-high for that month; downward if major global datasets show May merely 2nd–3rd or if preliminary NOAA summaries hint May fell short of May 2024/2020 by a clear margin.",
