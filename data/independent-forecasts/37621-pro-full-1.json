  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, with the key event being the NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' play is currently legal under NFL rules.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the NFL spring meeting on May 20-21, the proposal to ban forms of pushing the ball carrier fails to secure the required 24 votes from team owners. The coalition opposing the ban holds firm, arguing that the lack of injury data makes a ban unnecessary and that the rule change is an overreaction to a single team's successful strategy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the NFL spring meeting on May 20-21, the league office and Commissioner Roger Goodell successfully lobby at least 8 additional team owners to support the ban. The reworked, broader proposal that prohibits pushing any ball carrier is seen as a matter of general football principle, allowing the measure to pass with the required 24-vote supermajority.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant momentum and powerful influence of the parties advocating for the ban, weighed against the high threshold required for a rule change. The status quo is that the play is legal, and changing rules requires a 24-vote supermajority, which a recent proposal failed to achieve, receiving only 16 votes. This high bar is the strongest factor in favor of a 'No' outcome. However, several key factors point towards 'Yes'. First, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the league office, and the Competition Committee all publicly favor a ban. This creates immense institutional pressure on owners. Second, the proposal is being strategically reworked from a narrow ban on the 'Tush-Push' to a broader rule prohibiting pushing any ball carrier. This reframes the debate from targeting one team's successful play to upholding a general 'football principle', making it more palatable for owners to support. The fact that the vote is being revisited just a month after it was tabled indicates that the pro-ban coalition believes it can successfully sway the 8 additional votes needed. The primary argument against the ban — a lack of injury data — is a strong one, but the NFL has a history of making rule changes based on the aesthetics of the game and perceived, rather than proven, safety risks, as evidenced by Goodell's 'feels more like rugby' comment. The probability is not higher because flipping 8 votes in a month is a significant challenge, and the broader rule could raise new concerns about unintended consequences for other types of plays. The probability is not lower because the combined will of the Commissioner and the league office on a high-profile issue is a uniquely powerful force for change in the NFL. I would increase my forecast if there were reports of key owners publicly flipping their support to 'Yes'. I would decrease it if reports emerged that the broader rule proposal was losing support.",
