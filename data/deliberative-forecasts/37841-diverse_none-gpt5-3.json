    "review": "Both forecasters strengthen the status-quo case: Glastonbury’s track record of backing politically controversial acts, the Eavis family’s likely awareness of Kneecap’s profile when booking, and the short runway (≈5 weeks) all point toward follow-through. They add two pathways to No I hadn’t explicitly foregrounded: a police/security recommendation to organizers and a potential Home Office/entry exclusion (even for Irish citizens, though rare). I’m less convinced by the claim of an “active” police investigation without clear confirmation; the original reporting referenced referrals, which may or may not translate into active casework before June. The seriousness of proscription laws is real, but the timeline and institutional behavior still favor Yes. Overall, their reasoning is largely aligned with mine and slightly strengthens the pro‑Yes tilt via the “organizers knowingly accepted the controversy” point.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Announced Glastonbury acts perform at very high rates; late removals are uncommon and usually due to health/logistics. Glastonbury’s ethos and independence further raise the bar for a politically driven removal. Time: With ~33 days left, the window for a complaint to become charges, or for police/licensing to compel removal, is narrowing. Risks that could still flip the outcome include: (1) formal police action or a policing/security recommendation that pressures organizers; (2) licensing or public-safety concerns raised by authorities; (3) an entry/exclusion decision (low base rate but not impossible); (4) band-initiated withdrawal or health/logistics. The new deliberation points marginally increase the likelihood of Yes by emphasizing that organizers likely priced in the controversy when booking. I do not materially increase the probability because the legal/policing tail risk remains the main plausible path to No and is non-trivial until very close to the event. Net: slight upward nudge.",
