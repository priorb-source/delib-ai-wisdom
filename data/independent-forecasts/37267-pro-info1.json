  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ethiopia's nationwide travel advisory remains at 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel', as the current security situation, while challenging in specific regions, does not deteriorate to a level that warrants a country-wide elevation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing regional conflicts in areas like Tigray, Amhara, and Oromia continue but do not escalate to a point where they threaten the stability of the central government or the safety of the capital, Addis Ababa. The US State Department maintains the distinction between the nationwide Level 3 advisory and the specific Level 4 warnings for these conflict zones.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new, major shock to Ethiopia's security environment occurs. This could be a significant escalation of the Amhara or Oromia conflicts that threatens to encircle Addis Ababa, the outbreak of a new large-scale conflict, or a coup attempt that causes widespread instability. This rapid deterioration would lead the State Department to conclude that the risk to US citizens is severe and widespread, prompting an upgrade to 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 15% is primarily based on the principle of status quo inertia over a short timeframe. The US State Department has maintained a 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel' advisory for Ethiopia for over two years, having downgraded it from Level 4 in early 2023. Travel advisories of this nature are not changed lightly and typically require a dramatic and significant shift in the on-the-ground security situation. With less than two months until the resolution date, the most likely outcome is that the current advisory will remain in place.\n\nThe research indicates that while specific regions are correctly assessed as high-risk and carry a Level 4 warning, the bar for elevating the entire country is much higher. Such a move would imply that the threats of civil unrest, conflict, and crime have become pervasive nationwide or are critically threatening the capital, which is not the current assessment.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., 5%) because Ethiopia's political and security situation is fragile. The existence of multiple active conflicts means that a rapid escalation is a constant and plausible risk. These regional conflicts could spill over or a new political crisis could erupt with little warning, forcing a swift reassessment by the State Department.\n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., 30% or more) because there is currently no public evidence to suggest a catastrophic deterioration is imminent within the next eight weeks. For the advisory to change, events would have to significantly outpace the current trajectory of the conflicts, which, while serious, have been ongoing for some time.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of rebel advances on major transportation corridors to Addis Ababa, a declaration of a nationwide state of emergency, or a significant political breakdown within the federal government. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if meaningful peace talks in the Amhara or Oromia regions began or if there were a significant de-escalation of violence.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
