    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 2%, compared to my 3%. Our core reasoning aligns closely: we all cite the same historical base rate (~4% annually for novel bat CoVs producing human cases, or ~0.5% scaled to 46 days), acknowledge the virus's demonstrated but limited human cell infectivity, note the absence of surveillance signals, and recognize the extremely short timeframe. However, they raised two important points I underweighted: (1) Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'chain of low-probability events' needed—even if spillover occurs, the case must be symptomatic, sampled, sequenced, linked specifically to HKU5-CoV-2, and officially reported within 45 days. Each step has <100% probability. (2) Forecaster 3's point about naming/identification specificity—a novel merbecovirus case needs to be definitively identified as HKU5-CoV-2, not just 'a novel coronavirus.' These considerations suggest my detection/reporting conditional probability may have been slightly optimistic. The strong consensus around 2% from two independent forecasters using similar frameworks is also informative.",
    "rationale": "While my original analysis was sound, the other forecasters correctly emphasize that even conditional on a spillover event occurring in the next 46 days, there's a multi-step detection and reporting chain that must complete within that window. My 3% may have slightly underweighted the probability that a case could occur but not be officially reported by July 1st due to: delayed detection, sequence identification challenges, or reporting lags. The mathematical base rate of ~0.5% (from 4% annual scaled to 1.5 months) combined with modest upward adjustments for demonstrated human cell infectivity and surveillance quality, but downward adjustments for lower entry efficiency and the need for specific identification, points toward 2% being more defensible. The strong independent convergence at 2% suggests this is the appropriate forecast. I'm updating down by 1 percentage point to align with this consensus while acknowledging the adjustment is within normal forecasting uncertainty for such rare events.",
