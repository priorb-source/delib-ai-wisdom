    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement announced - the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue but technical details cannot be finalized within the tight 31-day window. The IMF requires specific reforms or conditions that Lebanon's fractured political system cannot commit to quickly enough. Minor disagreements on terms or implementation timelines prevent a formal announcement before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The finance minister's confidence is justified because negotiations are already in advanced stages. A staff-level agreement is finalized in the coming weeks, terms are agreed upon, and both parties make a formal announcement of the deal in mid to late June 2025, meeting the July 1st deadline.",
    "rationale": "The key considerations here are the very short timeframe (31 days) and Lebanon's complex negotiating history with the IMF. On the positive side, the finance minister's public confidence suggests negotiations may be further along than baseline expectations would suggest. A minister typically wouldn't make such statements without some substantive progress. However, several factors counsel against overconfidence: (1) Lebanon has a history of protracted IMF negotiations that have stalled or failed at various stages over recent years during its ongoing economic crisis; (2) IMF agreements require not just technical agreement but also credible policy commitments, often involving painful reforms that Lebanon's fragmented political system struggles to deliver; (3) Even if a staff-level agreement is reached, formal board approval and announcement processes take time; (4) The world changes slowly - the status quo of no agreement deserves significant weight. The 31-day window is extremely tight for finalizing what are typically complex, multi-stage negotiations. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of an imminent staff-level agreement announcement or reports of final-stage negotiations. For it to move lower, I would need news of significant obstacles, political deadlock, or contradictory statements from IMF officials. Given the positive signal balanced against structural constraints and time pressure, I estimate a 30% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
