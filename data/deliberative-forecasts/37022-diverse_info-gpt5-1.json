    "review": "Forecaster 3 adds concrete, series-specific numbers I hadn’t explicitly anchored to: Trading Economics shows ~1.869 trillion UAH for Feb 2025, implying March needs a +30.5B UAH move to clear 1.90T. Their distributional view (median +25B; 7/12 months ≥30B; last MoM +18.5B) is a useful, data-driven frame and highlights that a YES requires an above-median month. Forecaster 2’s argument likely conflates total state debt (≈7T UAH by end-2024) with the TE series. If TE’s “UAH Thousand” series were total, it wouldn’t be ~1.87T in Feb 2025. That makes the IMF disbursement and FX revaluation points less directly relevant if TE is tracking domestic central government debt outstanding. Without clear evidence that March net domestic issuance exceeded ~31B UAH, 99% seems overconfident.\n\nNet: F3’s specificity and volatility framing are convincing; F2’s conclusion relies on a mismatched definition and overstates confidence.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating down because the critical clarification is that the Trading Economics series appears to be well below total state debt (≈1.869T in Feb vs ≈7T total), so arguments about FX revaluation of external debt and total-debt flows don’t directly move the measured series. With that, the hurdle becomes a domestic debt outstanding increase of ~30.5B UAH in March. Historical monthly changes suggest this is plausible but not the base case: median ~25B, last month ~18.5B, but 7/12 months ≥30B indicates roughly coin-flip odds with a slight tilt to YES given wartime financing and frequent positive net issuance. Lacking concrete evidence of strong March net issuance/redemption schedules, I move from 82% to 57% to reflect an above-median month needed and recent momentum being softer. I would move up materially with confirmation that net domestic issuance in March exceeded ~35B UAH or that TE’s series includes FX debt (making the 9–11B revaluation relevant); I would move down with evidence of heavy March redemptions or net negative issuance.",
