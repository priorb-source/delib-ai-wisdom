  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome should be known within 1-2 weeks, as April 2025 unemployment data will be published by Inegi and reported on Trading Economics shortly after month-end.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the unemployment rate stays under 3%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's unemployment rate jumps to 3% or higher in April due to an immediate severe impact from US tariffs on the auto sector, causing mass layoffs, or there is a significant statistical revision to the data collection methodology.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's unemployment rate remains at or near the historic low of 2.2% recorded in March 2025, continuing the recent downward trend as the labor market remains stable through the end of April.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly supports a Yes outcome. Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025, down from 2.5% in February 2025 and 2.3% in March 2024, showing a consistent downward trend. For the rate to reach 3% or higher in April would require an unprecedented jump of at least 0.8 percentage points in a single month. Unemployment rates typically don't fluctuate this dramatically month-to-month without major economic shocks. While there are concerns about US tariffs affecting auto supply chains, these impacts typically take months to materialize in unemployment statistics, not days. Since today is April 29th, we're at the end of the measurement period with no reports of major labor market disruptions. The status quo heavily favors continuation of the low unemployment trend. My forecast is not higher (closer to 99%) because there remains small uncertainty around data revisions, potential unreported shocks, or statistical anomalies. My forecast is not lower because the baseline trend is very strong, we're past most of April, and there's no evidence of significant labor market deterioration. I would update higher if official preliminary reports confirm low unemployment, and lower only if news emerged of massive unexpected layoffs in April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
