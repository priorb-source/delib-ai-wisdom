    "review": "Both forecasters provide solid analyses with converging logic on the core dynamics. Forecaster 2's 85% confidence reflects strong conviction that disinflationary forces won't materially impact April, which I find reasonable but perhaps overconfident given inherent monthly volatility. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I hadn't considered: the Orthodox Easter calendar shift. Easter was May 5, 2024 but April 20, 2025, which shifts seasonal food price pressures into April 2025 and creates a favorable base effect for the year-over-year comparison. This is a genuinely important insight that strengthens the YES case. However, Forecaster 3's 68% forecast seems oddly conservative given they just made an argument supporting YES. All three of us agree on the fundamental setup: only 0.4 percentage points needed, strong momentum, NBU expects Q2 peak, war-related pressures persist. The Easter timing argument is compelling and materially strengthens the case beyond what I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the Easter calendar effect more heavily than I did initially. The shift from May 2024 to April 2025 creates both demand-side pressure (higher food purchases in April 2025) and a favorable base effect (comparing against a lower April 2024). Combined with the acceleration trend (12.9% → 13.4% → 14.6%), the tiny 0.4pp gap, March's strong 1.5% monthly rate, and NBU guidance that Q2 marks the inflation peak, the case for reaching 15.0% in April is stronger than my initial 72% suggested. However, uncertainty remains around actual monthly price movements, potential monetary policy transmission effects, and the possibility of early seasonal agricultural improvements or exchange rate stability providing downward pressure. While 85% seems too confident given these uncertainties, my initial 72% was likely too conservative given the Easter timing insight and the minimal gap needed. A modest upward revision to 75% better reflects the balance of evidence while maintaining appropriate humility about monthly volatility.",
