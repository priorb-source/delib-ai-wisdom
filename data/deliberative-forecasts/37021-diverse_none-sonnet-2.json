    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical argument I had underweighted: we are at April 22, 2025, meaning April's inflation data is essentially already determined - we're just awaiting publication. For inflation to reach 15% YoY in April, the CPI level would need to be 15% above April 2024. If recent months have shown inflation 'largely in single digits' as Forecaster 3 states, hitting 15% would require an extraordinary single-month spike in March or early April 2025. Such spikes typically require dramatic triggers (currency collapse, major tariff hikes, severe supply shocks) that transmit over multiple months, not instantaneously. Forecaster 2's analysis is solid regarding NBU capacity and the need for major shocks, but doesn't fully account for the timing constraint. The stagflation article reference suggests concern but not evidence of an actual recent shock. Neither my research assistant nor the provided materials indicate any March/April 2025 shock of sufficient magnitude.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating downward based on Forecaster 3's technical analysis of timing and mechanics. My original 40% overweighted general wartime inflationary pressures without sufficiently considering: (1) we're past the point where April data could change - it's already determined; (2) the mathematical requirement for YoY inflation to jump from single digits to 15% in a single month; (3) the lack of evidence for specific shocks in March/April 2025 that would cause such a jump. However, I'm not going as low as 9% because: (a) we lack concrete data on what March/April actually showed - there's residual uncertainty; (b) wartime environments can produce unreported or delayed-reporting shocks; (c) the stagflation article suggests real concerns even if not proof of ≥15%. I'm settling on a probability that reflects high confidence the threshold won't be met, but maintains non-trivial uncertainty given information gaps.",
