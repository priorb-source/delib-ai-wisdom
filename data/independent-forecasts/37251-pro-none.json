    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam has been announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations, if still ongoing, fail to conclude before the deadline due to disagreements over pricing, technology transfer, or financing. Alternatively, talks may have already stalled due to political sensitivities regarding Vietnam's relationship with China, and no announcement is made by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on their 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,' South Korean and Vietnamese officials finalize the long-negotiated deal. They make a joint announcement before the deadline, highlighting the K9 howitzer sale as a key milestone in their deepening security and defense cooperation.",
    "rationale": "The foundation for this forecast rests on weighing the strong strategic rationale for the deal against the significant passage of time since it was first reported. The initial report from The Korea Herald in late 2022 indicated active negotiations, which is a strong positive signal. The strategic logic is sound: Vietnam is seeking to modernize its military and diversify its arms suppliers away from its traditional reliance on Russia, while South Korea is an ambitious arms exporter with a proven, high-quality product in the K9 howitzer. An agreement would be a landmark first defense sale between the two nations, cementing their upgraded strategic partnership. However, the most significant piece of evidence pointing to a 'No' outcome is the absence of any public information or credible follow-up reports in the more than two years since the negotiations were first mentioned. My research assistant's report of 'No additional information available' corroborates this. Major arms deals of this nature are typically preceded by a crescendo of diplomatic visits, leaks, and official statements, none of which have been observed. This long silence suggests the talks may have stalled or collapsed due to financial hurdles, technical integration challenges, or a reluctance from Vietnam to risk antagonizing China. The status quo, in which no deal exists, has powerful inertia. The deadline of July 1, 2025 is also very near. My probability is not lower than 30% because the underlying strategic imperatives for both countries remain strong, and complex arms negotiations can be conducted in secret for long periods before a sudden announcement. An agreement could still be finalized and announced in the next two months. My probability is not higher because the prolonged lack of any confirming evidence or 'chatter' is a strong negative indicator that is difficult to ignore. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see new reports of high-level defense talks between Seoul and Hanoi or insider leaks suggesting a deal is imminent. Conversely, if either nation announced a similar artillery deal with a different partner, I would lower my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
