    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced the key constraints I had in mind and added a couple of useful specifics: (1) the NYT search requires exact-phrase matches, further penalizing odds; (2) in finance/legal contexts the correct term is overwhelmingly “reverse repurchase,” not “reverse purchase,” making that backdoor path very unlikely; and (3) the 6/18 shopping festival is a plausible but weak catalyst that could prompt a China-consumption trend piece, perhaps quoting state media verbatim. No hard evidence surfaced that NYT or Western outlets are adopting this exact phrasing. Overall, their analyses largely align with mine and slightly strengthen the case for a marginally lower probability.",
    "rationale": "The window is short (June 10–30), and the outcome hinges on NYT using one of two uncommon exact phrases. NYT style and typical translation choices make “reverse purchasing”/“reverse purchase” unlikely; for finance, “reverse repurchase” would not count; for consumer trends, NYT is more apt to use “reverse consumption,” paraphrase, or explain the concept without adopting this specific English phrasing unless quoting directly. The 6/18 shopping festival slightly raises the chance of a China retail trend piece that might cite People’s Daily or social media and include the exact words, but absent signs of broader English uptake or NYT previews, that catalyst is weak. Incorporating the others’ points on the exact-match constraint and domain terminology, I nudge my estimate down slightly.",
