    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that have caused me to reconsider my initial 10% forecast. Forecaster 2's procedural analysis is particularly strong - the Bob Jones University precedent showing that even cases with egregious facts (racial discrimination) took years to resolve is highly relevant and something I underweighted. Their detailed explanation of IRS authority, administrative processes, and the bill of attainder concerns with a Congressional path adds important depth. Forecaster 3 introduces what appears to be additional information about the IRS 'making plans' and notes internal IRS challenges (leadership turmoil, reduced staffing) that actually cut against rapid action capability. The convergence around extremely low probabilities (1% and 8%) from two independent analysts using similar reasoning about procedural barriers is notable. The core argument both make - that 66 days is simply insufficient for a legally durable revocation of a major university's 501(c)(3) status - is more convincing than I initially appreciated. Even with political will, the combination of required procedures, inevitable litigation, administrative complexity, and lack of precedent makes completion by July 1 extraordinarily unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 10% forecast overweighted the tail risk of unprecedented executive action and underweighted the institutional and procedural barriers. The Bob Jones precedent that Forecaster 2 cited is particularly illuminating - even with clear policy violations, the process took years. The 66-day timeframe is simply too compressed for: (1) IRS to initiate formal examination proceedings, (2) provide notice and opportunity to respond, (3) create adequate administrative record, (4) withstand inevitable court challenges, and (5) have credible reporting confirm the revocation. While Forecaster 3's mention of IRS 'making plans' suggests some administrative movement, planning and execution are vastly different, especially under legal scrutiny. The internal IRS challenges Forecaster 3 noted (leadership turmoil, reduced staffing) actually make rapid execution less likely, not more. I'm updating significantly downward but not to 1% because some residual tail risk remains of truly unprecedented norm-breaking action that could generate 'credible reporting' of revocation even if legally dubious. However, the procedural arguments are sufficiently strong that I should be much closer to Forecaster 2's position than my original forecast.",
