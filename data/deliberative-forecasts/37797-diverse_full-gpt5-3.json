    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the strong institutional inertia of FATF’s black list, the unlikelihood of removals (DPRK, Iran, Myanmar), and that Russia’s suspension has functioned as the political compromise—points I agree with. They also flag tail risks: a geopolitical shock or sudden escalation (notably Russia), or severe deterioration in a grey‑listed state. However, neither adds concrete new signals since the February 2025 plenary (e.g., ICRG warnings, pre‑plenary leaks, or regional body alerts) that would justify a double‑digit probability. Their 15–20% feels high versus base rates and the usual pre‑signaling before a black‑listing move.",
    "rationale": "I continue to weight: (1) base rate of black‑list changes per plenary is very low (only one addition—Myanmar—since 2018); (2) the February 2025 plenary showed no movement and did not telegraph imminent black‑listing; (3) removals of DPRK/Iran/Myanmar by June are exceedingly unlikely; (4) potential additions (Russia, Sahel states, Haiti) lack public pre‑signals of immediate escalation. The others’ arguments for tail risk are reasonable, so I slightly acknowledge that with a modest uptick, but in the absence of fresh indicators (ICRG pre‑briefs, credible media leaks, or regional body communiqués signaling non‑cooperation), I still see a sub‑10% chance for June. I would move higher if credible reporting emerges that FATF intends to escalate Russia or that a grey‑listed jurisdiction is deemed non‑cooperative and recommended for ‘call for action’; I would move lower if pre‑plenary communications again emphasize continuity.",
