    "review": "Both forecasters raise valid concerns that I initially underweighted. Forecaster 3's emphasis on threshold risk is important - the question requires UNDER 3.0%, so even 3.0% exactly resolves as No. The IMF projection (unemployment rising from 2.8% to 3.8% in 2025) and tariff headwinds are genuine risks. Forecaster 2's point about the uncertainty of immediate policy effectiveness is well-taken. However, I believe both forecasters may be overweighting medium-term risks when forecasting a specific April datapoint. The IMF's annual projection and potential GDP contraction don't necessarily translate to April specifically. Both acknowledge that labor market effects typically phase in over months, not instantly. The critical fact remains: March was 2.2%, requiring a 0.8 percentage point jump in one month for a No outcome. Historical unemployment data shows such single-month spikes are extraordinarily rare absent immediate catastrophic shocks. We're at April 29th - the data collection period has essentially passed. If massive layoffs occurred in April, we would likely have seen contemporaneous reporting. The informal sector (54.4% of workforce) actually provides stability to measured unemployment. While I was perhaps overconfident at 94%, I find the 60-75% range too pessimistic given the timing, the substantial buffer from March, and the lack of evidence for an immediate shock.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward modestly to acknowledge greater uncertainty than my initial 94% suggested. The threshold risk is real - we need strictly under 3.0%, and the genuine economic headwinds from tariffs and potential contraction deserve more weight. However, I'm not moving as low as the other forecasters because the core dynamics favor a Yes outcome: (1) March 2025 showed 2.2%, providing a 0.8pp buffer, (2) we're essentially at the end of April so any shock would need to have already occurred and be visible, (3) unemployment rates exhibit strong month-to-month inertia, (4) even with tariffs, employment effects typically manifest over quarters, not in single months, (5) no evidence has been presented of massive April layoffs sufficient to cause such a spike. The declining trend through early 2025 and the stabilizing effect of the large informal sector further support continuity. While I acknowledge meaningful uncertainty from economic headwinds, the probability that April specifically crosses the 3.0% threshold remains low given timing and historical patterns.",
