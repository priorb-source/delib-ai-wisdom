    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (Ukraine’s April 2025 CPI is typically released around May 10–12, after which Trading Economics updates).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent Ukrainian CPI inflation has been well below 15% YoY, with a gradual uptrend rather than a sudden surge.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Exchange rate remains relatively stable; only incremental energy/tariff adjustments; monthly CPI rises modestly, keeping YoY inflation in high single digits to low double digits, but under 15%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp hryvnia depreciation in April and/or sizeable administered price hikes (e.g., large electricity/gas/fuel increases) trigger an unusually large month‑over‑month CPI jump, lifting the YoY rate to ≥15%. Alternatively, a significant data revision appears on Trading Economics showing ≥15%.",
    "rationale": "Time and baseline: The April 2025 figure will post in mid‑May, so there’s limited time for new shocks to materially affect the April print. The status quo since 2023 has been disinflation from wartime peaks, with inflation in 2024 running largely in single digits and only gradually re‑accelerating. Crossing 15% by April would require an abrupt regime shift. Mechanics: To move the YoY rate to ≥15% in April, the CPI level in April 2025 must be at least 15% above April 2024. Given recent prints well below 15%, this would likely require an unusually large month‑over‑month increase in April (several percentage points), which typically occurs only with a sharp currency devaluation, major administered‑price hikes, or severe supply disruptions. Risks: War‑related shocks (energy infrastructure attacks), potential tariff hikes under IMF conditionality, and funding delays that pressure the hryvnia are real and could push inflation higher. However, these usually transmit over multiple months rather than in a single, step‑function jump large enough to add multiple percentage points to YoY in one month. The linked article’s “stagflation” framing suggests rising inflation and weak growth, but not necessarily an immediate jump to ≥15% by April. Evidence weighting: I overweight the recent trend (sub‑15%) and institutional factors (NBU policy, managed FX dynamics) that temper abrupt spikes, while keeping a tail for war‑driven shocks. Research assistant inputs: None provided beyond the question; no additional data to contradict the baseline. Why not higher: Because hitting ≥15% by April requires an outsized single‑month shock that is uncommon even in Ukraine’s current conditions, and there is no concrete evidence of such a shock already materializing in April. Why not lower: Elevated wartime risks, possible tariff adjustments, and FX sensitivity leave a non‑trivial tail that could surprise to the upside. What would raise my probability: Confirmed large April electricity/gas tariff hikes, a visible hryvnia slide in late March/April, or reports of double‑digit monthly increases in key CPI components (fuel, utilities). What would lower it: Stable FX, absence of major tariff moves, and indications that March/April monthly CPI remains moderate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
