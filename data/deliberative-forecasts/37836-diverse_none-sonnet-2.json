    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 claims the current baseline is 30 destinations, just below the threshold, which would make the seasonal effect critical. Forecaster 3 provides detailed route enumeration suggesting summer typically reaches 'low- to mid-30s' and claims the network 'commonly reaches or exceeds 31 in summer.' This is a crucial insight I missed: I was framing this as 'will things change by July 1' when I should have been asking 'what does the network look like on July 1 during peak summer season.' Both forecasters correctly emphasize that July 1 falls at peak summer travel season, when seasonal Turkish resort routes and other additions are already scheduled. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown (multiple Turkish airports, Gulf hubs, domestic Iraqi cities, Iran routes, Levant/Egypt destinations, European links) demonstrates informed structural knowledge of the route network, even if unverified. However, I have concerns: neither forecaster has verified current data from flightsfrom.com, and Forecaster 3's specific route claims remain unsubstantiated. The distinction between scheduled vs charter flights on flightsfrom.com creates counting uncertainty. Geopolitical risks (Iran tensions, regional instability) could suppress routes. Forecaster 2's claim of exactly 30 current destinations seems oddly precise without citation. Still, both forecasters' core argument is strong: summer schedules maximize route counts, these schedules are already finalized by late May, and the threshold of 31 was likely chosen to create meaningful uncertainty around typical summer levels.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward based on the summer seasonality argument. My original analysis overweighted 'status quo bias' without recognizing that the July 1 resolution date captures the peak summer state, not the current late-May state. If summer schedules typically approach or exceed 31 destinations (as Forecaster 3 suggests with route enumeration), and these schedules are already finalized, then the probability should be higher than my initial 48%. The specific timing of July 1 is not coincidental—it's designed to capture maximum summer operations. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecaster 3's 60% because: (1) their baseline claims lack verification, (2) flightsfrom.com's counting methodology introduces uncertainty, (3) geopolitical risks could suppress routes, particularly Iran/Levant connections, and (4) the question setter chose 31 as a threshold specifically to create uncertainty, suggesting it's genuinely close. I'm settling between Forecaster 2's 55% and Forecaster 3's 60%, acknowledging the strong seasonal argument while maintaining skepticism about unverified route counts and counting methodology.",
