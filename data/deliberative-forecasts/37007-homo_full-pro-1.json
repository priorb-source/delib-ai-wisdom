    "review": "The other forecasters provide sound and well-structured analyses that align closely with my own, which strengthens my confidence in the overall assessment of the situation. We all correctly identified the central tension between the PNM's incumbency advantage and the plausible path to victory via vote-splitting in Tobago, versus the challenges posed by a unified opposition and salient issues like crime. We were also in agreement on discounting the outlier WIC News poll and focusing on the large bloc of undecided voters as the key source of uncertainty. Forecaster 3 made a particularly valuable point by framing the early election's trigger (the PM's resignation) and the high-profile endorsement for the opposition as signs of negative momentum against the incumbent PNM. This was a nuance I had not fully weighed in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains largely the same, anchored on the PNM's structural advantages as the incumbent in a first-past-the-post system and the specific, credible evidence from the Guardian TT poll suggesting they could win Tobago's two seats due to opposition vote-splitting. This provides a clear, albeit narrow, path to a plurality. However, the deliberation has convinced me to slightly temper my confidence. The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, rightfully emphasized factors suggesting anti-incumbent momentum, such as the reason for the early election and a key endorsement for the opposition. While I was aware of these facts, I now believe I slightly underweighting their significance as signals of potential government weakness. The close agreement between all three of us in the 55-60% range suggests the forecast is in the right place, but their arguments have persuaded me that the downside risk for the PNM is slightly higher than I first estimated. Therefore, I am making a small downward adjustment to my forecast from 60% to 58% to reflect this sharpened understanding of the race's volatility and the subtle signs of momentum favoring the opposition.",
