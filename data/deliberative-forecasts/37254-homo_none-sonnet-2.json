    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are highly concordant with mine, all landing between 4-5%, which suggests we're converging on the correct probability range. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point about historical spacing - Russia's major invasions (Georgia 2008, Crimea 2014, Ukraine 2022) occurred years apart, not months, which strongly reinforces the low probability for a 2-month window. Forecaster 3's observation that Russia has not invaded any additional countries in the 3+ years since February 2022, despite ongoing opportunity, provides a powerful base rate argument for the status quo. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize how the extremely short timeframe drives the forecast down. Their reasoning on Moldova/Transnistria being the most plausible scenario, NATO Article 5 deterrence for Baltics, and Russia's resource constraints all align with my analysis. I find no significant flaws in their logic, and they haven't introduced information that contradicts my assessment. The near-consensus around 4-5% suggests this range is well-calibrated rather than indicating groupthink, as all analysts arrived at it through similar but independently articulated reasoning chains.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm strengthened in my conviction that the probability is very low, likely in the 4-5% range. The historical spacing argument - that Russia's invasions have been years apart, not months - is particularly compelling evidence I should have emphasized more. The base rate of 3+ years without additional invasions since Ukraine 2022 further supports staying near the lower bound. However, I maintain that 5% rather than 4% is appropriate because: (1) the difference is marginal and within reasonable uncertainty bounds; (2) 5% better captures irreducible tail risks including rapid escalation in Moldova/Transnistria, desperate Russian moves if facing collapse in Ukraine, or unforeseen geopolitical shocks; (3) we lack the most recent intelligence that could reveal concerning indicators; and (4) while unlikely, 2 months is technically sufficient time for a rapid military action, particularly in areas with existing Russian presence. The consensus around 4-5% validates that we're in the right ballpark, and I see no compelling reason to deviate from my initial assessment.",
