  "information": "As of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently no player has a .400 batting average. The highest is Freddie Freeman at .375 and Shohei Ohtani at .370, both well below the .400 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The top hitters maintain their current levels or experience the typical regression toward career norms as the sample size increases. Freeman and Ohtani continue batting around .360-.380 through late June but don't reach .400. This is the statistically expected outcome given historical patterns of batting average regression and the mathematical difficulty of gaining 25-30 points over a 6-week stretch",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of the current top hitters goes on an exceptional hot streak. Freeman or Ohtani would need to bat approximately .425 or higher over the next 40 games to reach .400 by July 1st. Alternatively, a different player could emerge with an extraordinary performance to reach this milestone",
    "rationale": "We are approximately 40-45 games into the MLB season (about 25-28% complete). The highest batting average is Freeman at .375, requiring a gain of 25 points to reach .400. Historically, batting .400 is extraordinarily rare - Ted Williams in 1941 was the last to finish a season at .400. While players occasionally maintain .400+ averages very early in seasons with small sample sizes, these typically decline as games accumulate. As we approach the season's midpoint (July 1st would be roughly 80-85 games), regression to career means becomes stronger. Freeman's career average is around .300 and Ohtani's is around .275-.280, suggesting their current performances are exceptional outliers unlikely to improve further. To reach .400 by July 1st, Freeman would need to bat approximately .425 over his next 160 at-bats - a virtually unprecedented sustained performance. The referenced Aaron Judge case from 2022 exemplifies the typical pattern where early hot starts cool off. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) two elite players are relatively close at .375 and .370, (2) 6 weeks allows time for a historic hot streak, (3) variance still exists at this sample size, and (4) while extremely rare, it's not mathematically impossible. I would update higher if a player reached .390+ in the coming weeks or multiple players clustered above .380. I would update lower if all top averages fell below .350 or historical analysis showed no player has maintained such averages past May in recent decades",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
