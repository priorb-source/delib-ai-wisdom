    "review": "Both analyses align with my priors on short timelines, procedural steps (including deposit with the AU), and South Sudan’s capacity/prioritization constraints. They add two useful nuances: (1) the mid‑year AU cycle can spur last‑minute deposits, and (2) treaty ratifications can be bundled and fast‑tracked when the executive prioritizes them. They also foreground the risk that even with parliamentary passage, the deposit step can slip past the deadline. I find their reasoning sound; there’s no new concrete signal of progress, but their points slightly increase the near‑term hazard rate versus my baseline.",
    "rationale": "About 60 days remain, and there are no public signals of cabinet approval, R‑TNLA scheduling/passage, or instrument preparation. South Sudan’s legislative bandwidth and competing priorities (security, humanitarian, fiscal) make rapid sequencing less likely, and the deposit must be completed before July 1. That keeps the base case as No. However, ratification is low‑cost politically, can be bundled with other treaties, and the AU’s mid‑year rhythm can catalyze late moves. Those considerations, highlighted by the other forecasters, modestly raise the chance of a compressed timeline if the executive chooses to prioritize it. Absent concrete movement by early June, the probability would fall further, but given possible fast‑tracking, I slightly increase my estimate.",
