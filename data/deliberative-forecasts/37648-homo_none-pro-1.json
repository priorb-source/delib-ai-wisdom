    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same 35% probability, and their reasoning is highly convergent with my own. We all identified the central tension between the very short timeline and strong status quo inertia favoring a 'No' outcome, and the single, powerful piece of counter-evidence from the Israeli intelligence report favoring a 'Yes'. Forecaster 2 helpfully articulated that the groundwork for a deal might already be complete, making the short timeline more feasible, and emphasized that the broad resolution criteria could be met by a limited agreement. Forecaster 3 provided a crucial note of caution by highlighting that the evidence is a 'second-hand report from a third party,' which is an excellent reason for not raising the forecast higher. Both analyses were convincing and served to reinforce the key pillars of the initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 35%. The deliberation process has strengthened my confidence in this probability. The consensus at 35% suggests that this figure accurately balances the competing factors. My rationale remains unchanged in its core: the baseline probability for a complex diplomatic agreement on this timeline is very low, but the credible Israeli intelligence report about a 'high chance' of a deal necessitates a significant upward revision. The other forecasters' points have helped refine this rationale. The possibility of a more limited agreement, as mentioned by Forecaster 2, makes a 'Yes' resolution more plausible within the tight timeframe. Simultaneously, the risk that this is a second-hand report subject to misinterpretation or strategic leaking, as noted by Forecaster 3, justifies keeping the forecast well below 50%. The current probability correctly reflects a substantial chance of a deal while still acknowledging that failure remains the more likely outcome.",
