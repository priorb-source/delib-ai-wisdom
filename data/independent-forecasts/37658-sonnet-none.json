    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No formal termination announced; the deal remains in regulatory limbo and continues to face significant political and regulatory headwinds",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The companies continue pursuing regulatory approval despite obstacles. No formal termination is filed before July 1, even if the deal faces long odds. Parties may be negotiating concessions, awaiting final CFIUS decisions, or choosing to extend deadlines rather than formally terminate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS formally rejects the deal on national security grounds, forcing termination. Alternatively, facing insurmountable political opposition and regulatory delays after 17+ months, one or both parties conclude the deal is not viable and file an 8-K announcing termination of the merger agreement.",
    "rationale": "The Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel merger was announced in December 2023, meaning by May 2025 it has been pending for approximately 17 months. This is unusually long for a major acquisition, suggesting serious regulatory or political obstacles. The deal has faced intense opposition from the Biden administration, the United Steelworkers union, and bipartisan political concerns about foreign ownership of a strategic U.S. steel producer. CFIUS review of foreign acquisitions with national security implications can be lengthy and often results in rejection or heavily modified terms. However, the specific question asks about formal collapse (SEC 8-K filing) within the next 45 days. Even deals that ultimately fail may not be formally terminated immediately - companies often continue pursuing approval or negotiating modifications. The status quo of regulatory limbo could easily persist past July 1, even if the deal is effectively doomed. Without specific current information about the state of negotiations or CFIUS review as of May 2025, I must balance the probability that mounting pressures force termination soon against the possibility that parties continue pushing forward through July. My forecast is not higher because companies have strong incentives to avoid formal termination (break-up fees, reputational concerns, possibility of political change) and may continue through July even with dim prospects. It's not lower because 17 months is extraordinarily long, suggesting an imminent decision point, and political/regulatory pressures may force resolution soon. I would update higher with news of CFIUS rejection signals or either party's public statements about reconsidering the deal. I would update lower with news of progress toward approval or formal timeline extensions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
