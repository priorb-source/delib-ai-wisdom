  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security situation on the Israel–Lebanon front remains tense; insurers keep restrictions; only the already-announced resumptions (e.g., SAS CPH/ARN, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW) materialize, with few or no additional Gulf/Turkish/Egyptian resumptions. Net count sits in the mid-40s on flightsfrom.com.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Clear de-escalation and insurer greenlights prompt several big resumptions in June: at least 7–10 net new destinations arrive quickly (e.g., Qatar Airways to DOH, Kuwait Airways to KWI, Saudia to RUH/JED, EgyptAir to CAI, Turkish or Pegasus to IST/SAW, Gulf Air to BAH) alongside MEA’s added seasonal European leisure routes, lifting the total above 51 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What it would take: The research assistant (RA) reports ~39 active destinations in May 2025 (OAG), down from 53 in May 2024. To resolve Yes (>51), Beirut (BEY) needs roughly +13 versus May. The known pipeline adds about five by July 1: SAS (CPH, ARN), Wizz (AUH), MEA seasonal (BCN), LOT (WAW). That implies around 44 absent further changes.\n- Missing pieces: Several key carriers/routes remain suspended as of May (RA: British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus; also Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways). These represent many of the easiest incremental destinations needed to clear 51. With ongoing cross-border hostilities, high insurance premiums, and weak demand signals (tourism ministry projects summer arrivals ~30% below 2019; Q1 2025 pax down 1.4% YoY; transit down >90%), a broad wave of resumptions in the next six weeks looks unlikely.\n- Countervailing updates: Positives include Emirates’ full resumption (and extra frequency) and Air France/Transavia returns, plus the named adds for June/July. But these mainly boost frequency and a handful of destinations, not the dozen-plus needed. New airport security measures and bans on some Iranian flights could even reduce destinations at the margin.\n- Why not higher: From an estimated ~39 in May, the firm pipeline likely gets BEY to the low-to-mid 40s by July 1. Surging past 51 would require multiple major Gulf/Turkish/Egyptian resumptions plus additional MEA seasonal Europe leisure adds—an aggressive swing given the present risk and demand backdrop.\n- Why not lower: Summer seasonality and already-announced launches provide real upside versus May. Airlines can announce short-notice resumptions if risk perception improves. A handful of additional returns (e.g., Turkish or Qatar) are plausible, even if not my base case.\n- What would raise my forecast: Credible airline schedule filings and official notices (and appearance on flightsfrom.com) of two or more among Qatar (DOH), Kuwait (KWI), Saudia (JED/RUH), EgyptAir (CAI), Turkish/Pegasus (IST/SAW), Gulf Air (BAH) by mid-June; evidence of multiple MEA seasonal European additions beyond BCN.\n- What would lower it: Further escalation or airspace/insurance issues leading to cancellations; continued absence of key Gulf and Turkish carriers into late June; any additional bans impacting Iranian or regional routes.\nTaking the slow-to-change status quo seriously, I expect a total well under 52 by July 1 unless there’s a notable de-escalation-driven wave of resumptions in the next few weeks.",
