    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the 18-month gap since the 2023 license announcement is a strong negative signal I underweighted. If service were straightforward, it likely would have gone live earlier, so persistence of the status quo suggests lingering regulatory, security, or commercial blockers. Forecaster 3’s reminder that “Available” implies orderability and deliveries (not just regulatory clearance) also reinforces that a quiet map flip requires operational readiness, not only licensing. Both highlight the short remaining window and the need for tangible pre-launch signals (distribution, preorders, ground stations or laser-link readiness, official statements). I still think a sudden activation is possible given Starlink’s history and minimal infrastructure needs via ISLs, but the long delay materially lowers odds within 6–7 weeks.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down from 60% to 40%. The key update is giving more weight to the long post-license delay as evidence of unresolved issues that may not clear by July 1, combined with the short runway. Offsetting factors (Starlink’s ability to activate quickly, occasional sudden map updates, potential quarter-end push by June 30) keep the probability from dropping too low. However, absent concrete signs—local distribution readiness, order page acceptance for Somali addresses, or an official availability statement—the base case is continued delay. Thus, I moderately favor No but retain a meaningful chance of a late-quarter flip to Yes.",
