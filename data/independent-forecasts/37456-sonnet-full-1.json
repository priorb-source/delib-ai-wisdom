  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days remain until July 1, 2025, when the question resolves.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active past July 1, 2025, resulting in a No resolution. This is the current state as of May 7, 2025, 40 days after the recall was issued.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall verification process extends beyond July 1 due to the complexity of tracking products across multiple states through foodservice channels, combined with the extended shelf life of some products (until March 2026) requiring additional time to verify disposition. The recall remains Active on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill efficiently retrieves or accounts for the recalled products within the next 55 days, FSIS completes its effectiveness checks expeditiously, and the recall status is changed to Closed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued March 28, 2025, making July 1 exactly 94 days later. Historical data indicates Class III recalls have a median closure time of approximately 90 days, putting us right around the typical timeframe. However, several complicating factors suggest this recall may take longer than median: (1) multi-state distribution across at least 8 states complicates verification, (2) foodservice distribution channels are harder to track than retail, (3) the large volume of 212,268 pounds requires extensive verification, and (4) some products have shelf lives extending to March 2026, potentially requiring longer monitoring. After 40 days, the recall remains Active with no public indication of imminent closure. Factors favoring faster closure include: the Class III classification (lowest risk requiring less intensive scrutiny), no reported illnesses, Cargill's proactive cooperation evident in the precautionary nature of the recall, and clear product identification via establishment number. The status quo heavily favors the recall remaining open past July 1, as typical multi-state foodservice recalls with these characteristics historically exceed the 90-day median. However, we're close enough to the median timeframe that efficient execution could result in closure. My forecast is not higher because we're already 40 days in with no signs of closure, and the complicating factors historically push recalls past median times. It's not lower because we're only slightly past the median timeframe, and Class III recalls can sometimes resolve quickly given their lower risk profile.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
