  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until 2025-07-01).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 13 dissolution decree stays in force while the junta drafts a new framework; no reinstatement of parties before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts either do not overturn the decree or are ignored; protests are contained; the junta maintains the dissolution until a future law is ready, with no explicit reversal announced before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To defuse domestic/legal/international pressure, the junta publicly rescinds or suspends the May 13 decree and broadly reinstates parties (including allowing new party formation), possibly reverting to a ‘suspension of activities’ regime pending a new law.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no reversal. Mali’s junta has consolidated power since the coups, repeatedly delaying a return to electoral politics and showing willingness to ignore external pressure (ECOWAS exit, UN withdrawal). On May 13 they not only dissolved parties but also preceded it with CNT repeal of the legal framework for parties, signaling intent to keep organized opposition sidelined while they draft a new system on their timeline. Courts in such contexts have limited independence; even an adverse ruling could be sidelined. International condemnation (UN, Amnesty) has modest leverage, and ECOWAS leverage is reduced post-withdrawal. Arrests of opposition figures and prior suspension of political activities suggest continued repression rather than near‑term liberalization. The window is short (≈6 weeks), and drafting/reinstatement processes typically take longer. I keep a small probability for a tactical climb‑down: a court decision the regime chooses to honor, a calibrated concession to ease pressure (e.g., rescinding dissolution but maintaining a de facto freeze), or an internal elite bargain amid protests or economic/security shocks. Summary of key inputs from the research assistant: the May 13 decree; CNT’s 130–2 vote to repeal the parties law; stated plan to draft a new framework; legal challenges underway; arrests and protests; broad international condemnation; AU urged to mediate; ECOWAS withdrawal. Not higher because the junta’s incentives, recent behavior, weakened external leverage, and institutional setup all point against a rapid reversal. Not lower because short‑term tactical reversals to manage risk are possible, and a formal announcement rescinding the decree (even if paired with other constraints) would satisfy resolution criteria. I would update higher if: credible reports the administrative section of the Supreme Court annuls/suspends the decree and the junta signals compliance; AU or key partners (e.g., Algeria, Russia) press for and secure a concession; large, sustained protests or elite fractures emerge; or official drafts/leaks show imminent reinstatement. I would update lower if: intensified repression, new decrees hardening the ban, or clear signals that any new framework will only materialize well after July without interim reinstatement.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
