    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces critical new information I had missed: RFK Jr. specifically announced in April 2025 his intent to instruct CDC to stop recommending fluoridation, and there are coordinated actions across EPA and FDA. This is much more concrete than a general 'review' - it's an explicit directive from the HHS Secretary. The observation that 40 days have passed without change is valuable evidence of bureaucratic friction. Forecaster 2's point about the resolution criteria is crucial: simply removing the webpage would trigger a No, and this could be done administratively in days rather than months. Forecaster 3 provides additional context (Florida's ban) but may be overconfident in bureaucratic inertia given the explicit political directive. The 95% forecast seems to underweight the risk of administrative page removal while the review is 'ongoing.' Both forecasters agree the timeline is short, but they differ on whether political will can overcome bureaucratic processes quickly enough.",
    "rationale": "I need to significantly update downward based on new information. The April 2025 announcement from RFK Jr. stating intent to stop CDC fluoridation recommendations, combined with coordinated EPA review and FDA phase-out actions, represents much stronger political pressure than I initially understood. This isn't just a routine review - it's an explicit directive from the HHS Secretary who has known anti-fluoridation views. The key vulnerability is that the resolution criteria includes page removal. The CDC could administratively take down the page while stating it's 'under review pending CPSTF findings,' which would resolve as No. This action wouldn't require completing a full scientific review - just an administrative decision. However, the fact that 40 days have passed since the announcement without change is meaningful. This suggests either internal resistance, legal review delays, or coordination challenges. The short 42-day remaining timeline still creates substantial friction for any change. Professional organizations' support and reputational concerns about abrupt withdrawal add friction. My updated forecast balances: (1) explicit political directive with coordination across agencies, (2) administrative pathway to quick page removal, (3) observed 40-day inertia suggesting resistance or delays, and (4) very short remaining timeline that favors status quo. I'm moving from 80% to 72%, acknowledging heightened risk while still favoring the status quo.",
