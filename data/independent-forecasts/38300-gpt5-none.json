    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (Metaculus checks on/after June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — YoY growth remains positive, continuing April’s +1.49% YoY reading",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 experiences an unusually large broad-based MoM decline (e.g., sharp drops in autos, aerospace, utilities, or mining) while May 2024 was relatively strong, flipping YoY slightly negative on release.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production in May 2025 is flat to slightly higher versus April, or even a modest dip that’s still above May 2024’s level; recent strength (record high index levels) carries through, keeping YoY > 0.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: April 2025 YoY was +1.49% (per FRED as of May 27). With YoY already positive and the Real Economy Blog noting the index hit a record high recently, the base case is that May’s level remains at or near those highs, implying YoY stays positive. The world changes slowly; industrial production rarely flips signs YoY without a clear shock. \n- What would it take for No? A substantial one-month contraction in May 2025 combined with a relatively strong May 2024 comparison. Industrial production can be volatile month-to-month (utilities/weather, specific manufacturing shocks like aerospace or autos), but it typically takes a notably large and well-synchronized decline to swing YoY from +1.5% to negative in a single month.\n- Why not higher? Initial releases can surprise; sector-specific shocks (e.g., aircraft production cutbacks, auto schedules, or a utilities swing) could deliver an outsized negative MoM. Also, base effects from May 2024 could be less favorable than April’s.\n- Why not lower? Evidence points to strength: April YoY was clearly positive and commentary indicates record-high index levels, suggesting the absolute level in May likely remains above May 2024 even with a modest pullback.\n- What would move me up? Pre-release indicators showing broad industrial strength in May (e.g., strong manufacturing output proxies, utilities demand, mining strength), or credible reports that May’s IP level set another high.\n- What would move me down? Credible reports of a sizable May output drop across multiple major industries or an unusually strong May 2024 base that would erase April’s YoY cushion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
