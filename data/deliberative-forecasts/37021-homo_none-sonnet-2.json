    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling points I should consider. Forecaster 2 effectively emphasizes that the stagflation warning was issued 'in real-time during April 2025,' suggesting the problem is current and immediate rather than hypothetical - this is a stronger signal than I initially weighted. Both forecasters also note that we're essentially in a situation where the data exists but isn't published, which means the outcome is already determined. However, I notice we all agree on the core interpretation: 'one step away from stagflation' linguistically suggests not quite at crisis levels yet. Where we differ is how much weight to give this warning. Forecaster 3's mention of international aid and central bank interventions as moderating factors is well-taken, though this cuts both ways - these supports may prevent reaching 15%, but their presence also confirms the pressures exist. The forecasts of 55-60% from the others versus my 38% suggest I may have been too conservative. The key question is whether 'one step away' means inflation is at 12-13% (favoring No) or 14-14.5% (favoring Yes). Neither interpretation seems clearly more likely given the evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I underweighted the significance of a major news source raising stagflation alarms on April 10 about conditions in April itself. This real-time warning during the month in question is a stronger signal than I initially credited. However, I maintain that the specific phrasing 'one step away' still suggests Ukraine hasn't crossed the 15% threshold yet - if inflation were already at 15%+ in early April, the article would more likely declare stagflation present rather than imminent. The linguistic choice matters. That said, 'one step away' could reasonably mean anywhere from 12-14.9%, and the upper end of that range makes 15% more achievable if conditions worsened through mid-to-late April. The lack of specific recent data creates genuine uncertainty. I'm updating upward to acknowledge the real-time nature of the warning is more significant than I initially weighted, but not as high as 55-60% because I still believe the language suggests we're probably just below rather than at the threshold. My updated forecast splits the difference between my initial conservative reading and the others' more bullish interpretations.",
