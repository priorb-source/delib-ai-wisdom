    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable new information and perspectives that challenged my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasized the power of incumbency and the historical base rate of PNM success, which I may have initially underweighted. They also correctly highlighted the narrow margin from the 2020 election, where a swing of just a few seats is decisive. Forecaster 3 provided the most critical new evidence: specific polling data from Guardian TT. This data pointed to two crucial factors I had not considered: first, that vote-splitting among opposition parties in the two Tobago seats makes them likely wins for the PNM, and second, that a large bloc of voters (20%) remains undecided. The information on the Tobago seats, in particular, fundamentally weakens the premise that the UNC-COP coalition will function as a perfectly unified front, which was a cornerstone of my original forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial 40% probability was largely based on the assumption that the UNC-COP coalition would prevent the opposition vote-splitting that often benefits the PNM, creating a dynamic similar to the opposition's victory in 2010. However, the polling data introduced by Forecaster 3, which suggests the PNM is poised to win both Tobago seats precisely *because* of opposition vote-splitting there, invalidates this core assumption. This gives the PNM a critical two-seat advantage from the outset, making the opposition's path to a plurality much more difficult. This structural advantage, combined with the general power of incumbency, now makes the PNM the marginal favorite in my view. While the high crime rate and the large bloc of undecided voters still create significant volatility and a clear path to victory for the opposition, the PNM's advantage in Tobago is a more concrete factor. I am therefore revising my forecast upward by 17 percentage points, from 40% to 57%.",
