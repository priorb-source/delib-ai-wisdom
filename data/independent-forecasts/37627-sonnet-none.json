    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call has occurred yet between Trump and Zelenskyy since May 12, 2025. If the current situation persists, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy do not speak on the phone during the resolution period. They might communicate through other channels (in-person meetings, written correspondence, intermediaries), or they might not communicate directly at all. Trump could also delegate Ukraine-related discussions to his Secretary of State or other officials, avoiding a direct phone call himself.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy have at least one phone conversation during the 33-day window, likely to discuss urgent matters related to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, peace negotiations, military aid packages, or other diplomatic issues. Both sides publicly acknowledge the call afterward, which is standard diplomatic protocol for calls between heads of state.",
    "rationale": "As of May 13, 2025, Donald Trump is the sitting US President (inaugurated January 2025), and the Ukraine-Russia conflict presumably continues. The relationship between the US President and Ukrainian President during an active conflict typically involves regular high-level communication. The 33-day window (May 12 to June 15) provides reasonable opportunity for at least one phone call. Factors supporting a higher probability: (1) Trump's position as sitting president creates diplomatic necessity for direct communication; (2) Ukraine relies heavily on US military and financial support; (3) Active conflict situations often require frequent leader-to-leader coordination; (4) One month is long enough that avoiding all phone contact would be unusual. Factors keeping probability from being higher: (1) The Trump-Zelenskyy relationship has historically been complicated (per the Sky News background); (2) Trump might prefer in-person meetings or other communication methods; (3) He could delegate Ukraine discussions to cabinet officials; (4) Only 1 day has passed since the window opened, and no call has been reported yet, suggesting the status quo. For me to update higher (toward 75-85%), I would need to see: reports of scheduled calls, escalating conflict requiring urgent consultation, or patterns of frequent Trump-Zelenskyy communication in early 2025. To update lower (toward 35-45%), I would need: evidence Trump is avoiding direct contact with Zelenskyy, reports of strained relations, or Trump explicitly delegating all Ukraine matters to subordinates. Given the diplomatic context and reasonable time window, but accounting for relationship complexities and the status quo showing no call yet, I estimate a moderate-to-somewhat-likely probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
