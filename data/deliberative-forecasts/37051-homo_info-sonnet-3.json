    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that have strengthened my understanding of the barriers to revocation. Forecaster 2's most important contribution is highlighting that Harvard has already filed a lawsuit - this creates a critical procedural barrier I underweighted. Courts routinely issue preliminary injunctions in such cases, which would prevent revocation during litigation. There is virtually no scenario where that litigation would be fully resolved by July 1. Forecaster 3 provides valuable historical context with the Bob Jones precedent (7+ years) and emphasizes the unavoidable administrative law requirements. The key insight both share is that even with maximum political pressure, the IRS must follow established procedures including formal notice, response opportunities, and administrative review. These cannot be bypassed even by presidential pressure. Both also correctly note that the IRS has authority here, not the President directly, and that the legal basis appears weak. However, I find Forecaster 2's acknowledgment of the funding freeze as evidence of follow-through important - this shows some real-world action backing the threats, which prevents me from going as low as 1.5%. The decisive factor is the combination of (1) active litigation that will result in preliminary injunctions, (2) the 67-day window being impossibly short for completing administrative processes, and (3) multiple legal safeguards against politically motivated revocations.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast downward from 5% to 3%. The most compelling new argument is the lawsuit/injunction mechanism that Forecaster 2 raised - preliminary injunctions are standard in these cases and would prevent implementation during the legal process, which cannot possibly resolve by July 1. This creates an essentially insurmountable barrier I initially underweighted. Forecaster 3's Bob Jones precedent (7+ years) also provides concrete historical evidence for the timeline impossibility. I remain slightly higher than Forecaster 3's 1.5% because the unprecedented political environment and demonstrated follow-through (the $2.2 billion funding freeze) warrant some acknowledgment that unusual actions occasionally occur. However, I'm moving down from my original 5% because the legal and procedural barriers - particularly the lawsuit creating injunctive relief - are more decisive than I initially assessed. The combination of active litigation, the 67-day timeframe, administrative law requirements, and the weak legal basis for revocation makes this outcome highly unlikely. I would only revise upward if courts denied Harvard's injunction requests or if the IRS formally issued revocation notices with novel expedited procedures.",
