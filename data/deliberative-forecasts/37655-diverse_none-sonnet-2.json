    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 raises important points I underweighted: the strong domestic political consensus against wartime elections, and the severe logistical challenges involving IDPs, refugees, and soldiers voting. These are practical barriers beyond just the legal constraints. Forecaster 3 adds valuable procedural detail about the Verkhovna Rada resolution requirement and makes a useful distinction between lifting martial law entirely versus potentially announcing a future date while martial law continues. All three of us converge on very low probabilities (2%, 5%, 7%), which increases my confidence that the base rate assessment is sound. The main area of disagreement is how much probability mass to assign to tail scenarios—diplomatic breakthroughs, creative legal workarounds, or black swan events. Forecaster 2's 2% seems slightly overconfident given the remaining uncertainty, while my original 7% may have been too generous to unlikely scenarios. Forecaster 3's 5% strikes a reasonable middle ground.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward from 7% to 5%. The additional considerations that most influenced me are: (1) the domestic political consensus strongly opposing wartime elections, which represents an additional barrier beyond just legal constraints, (2) the specific procedural requirements through the Verkhovna Rada that would need to be satisfied, and (3) the practical impossibility of organizing voting infrastructure for millions of displaced persons and soldiers in just 45 days. However, I'm not going as low as 2% because the question only requires an announcement, not actually holding an election. This leaves open a narrow scenario where Ukraine could announce a specific future election date (perhaps contingent on martial law ending) as part of diplomatic signaling or peace negotiations, without needing to resolve all the practical barriers immediately. Additionally, with geopolitical situations, low-probability high-impact events do occur, and 45 days, while short, is not impossibly short for diplomatic developments. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 2-7% range reinforces that the structural barriers are formidable and the status quo strongly favors No.",
