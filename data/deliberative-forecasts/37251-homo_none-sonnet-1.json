    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I should weigh more carefully. Forecaster 2's mention of regional sensitivities, particularly China's potential reaction to Vietnam's military modernization, is a significant geopolitical factor I underweighted. This could add political complexity beyond the normal technical and financial negotiations. Forecaster 3 makes an astute observation that the negotiations are 'reportedly' happening rather than officially confirmed, suggesting we may be working with less certain information about how substantive these talks actually are. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the status quo bias - most negotiations don't conclude within any given 2-month window without clear evidence they're near completion. The converging forecasts around 28-32% suggest I may have been slightly too optimistic at 35%. However, I don't think the evidence warrants going as low as 28% because the reported negotiations do include specific details (20 units, $300M value) that suggest some substance rather than pure speculation.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward slightly. The key factors that push me lower: (1) The China geopolitical dimension adds complexity I initially underweighted - Vietnam must carefully manage its relationship with China while diversifying its defense suppliers; (2) The 'reportedly in negotiations' phrasing suggests this information may not be from official sources, indicating negotiations might be more preliminary than I assumed; (3) The complete absence of additional information or updates is more concerning upon reflection - if negotiations were advancing rapidly toward conclusion, we'd likely see some indicators; (4) The consensus view from other experienced forecasters around 28-32% suggests my 35% may have been optimistic. Factors keeping me from going lower: The specific details in the Korea Herald report (20 units, specific dollar amount) suggest real substance, and 2 months is technically sufficient time for announcing an agreement framework if both parties were strongly motivated to conclude quickly. Balancing these considerations, I'm adjusting to 32%, aligned with Forecaster 2's analysis which I find most comprehensive.",
