  "information": "Polling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025, when Morning Consult data will be checked",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney has higher approval than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's approval rating surges above his typical 40-45% range due to strong economic performance or successful foreign policy, while Carney's honeymoon period ends quickly due to early governing challenges, policy missteps, or economic headwinds in Canada. Alternatively, if Carney did not actually win the April election, the question would resolve No by default.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains momentum from his pre-election 48% approval rating and benefits from a typical new Prime Minister honeymoon period lasting through July 1. Trump's approval remains in his historical 40-45% range or declines due to domestic policy controversies or economic concerns. The strong anti-Trump sentiment among Canadians (77% negative) translates to sustained higher approval for Carney.",
    "rationale": "The question assumes Mark Carney is Prime Minister on July 1, 2025, following the April 28 snap election. The pre-election polling showed promising signs: Carney had 48% approval in late March, was the preferred choice for PM (38% vs 34%), and 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump. These are strong baseline indicators. New Prime Ministers typically experience a honeymoon period lasting several months, and July 1 (2 months post-election) falls well within this window. Trump's approval ratings have historically ranged between 40-45% domestically in Morning Consult tracking. The key uncertainty is whether Carney actually won the election - the Conservatives held a 39-36% national lead in late March polling, though Carney had better personal favorables. The question's framing assumes he is PM, which I treat as the base case. My forecast is not higher because: (1) there's residual uncertainty about election outcome given the close polling, (2) approval ratings can be volatile and honeymoon effects vary, (3) Trump's approval could surge with strong economic performance, and (4) we lack current May data on either leader. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the pre-election data strongly favored Carney personally, (2) the timeframe favors a honeymoon effect, (3) Canadian anti-Trump sentiment is very strong, and (4) Trump's approval has been relatively stable in the low-to-mid 40s. I would update higher with confirmation of Carney's election victory and current polling showing sustained approval advantages. I would update lower if evidence emerged that Carney lost the election or if his approval has dropped significantly in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
