    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days from today (May 5, 2025) until July 1, 2025, when the resolution criterion is evaluated.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active. The recall was issued on April 24, 2025, making it only 11 days old as of today. If nothing changes from the current state, the recall would continue to show as Active on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active past July 1, 2025. This occurs if the standard recall process timeline extends beyond the deadline - product retrieval takes longer than expected, ACC Central Kitchen LLC requires more time to implement and verify corrective actions, or USDA needs additional time to complete its verification and documentation processes before changing the status to Closed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025. This requires ACC Central Kitchen LLC to rapidly retrieve all affected pork bun products from commerce, implement necessary corrective actions to prevent future misbranding, and have USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service verify compliance and complete all administrative processes to officially close the recall within the next 57 days.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires estimating typical USDA recall closure timelines. The recall was issued April 24, 2025, providing a total window of approximately 67 days until July 1, 2025 - about 9.5 weeks. Food safety recalls, particularly for allergen misbranding issues, typically take 2-4 months to close, though timelines vary significantly. The status quo strongly favors the recall remaining Active, as we're only 11 days into the process. Factors weighing against closure include: (1) the relatively short timeframe available, (2) typical regulatory processes requiring product retrieval verification, corrective action implementation, and USDA documentation, and (3) no information suggesting unusually rapid progress. Factors slightly favoring closure include: (1) this is a misbranding issue rather than a contamination issue, which may allow faster resolution, (2) the recall size of ~65,000 pounds is moderate rather than massive, potentially allowing quicker retrieval, and (3) some recalls do close within 2 months when companies are highly responsive. My research assistant provided no additional information to adjust from base rate expectations. The forecast is not higher because typical recall timelines exceed 67 days and status quo bias strongly favors no change. The forecast is not lower because some recalls, particularly misbranding cases with responsive companies, do close within 2 months. I would update higher with evidence of rapid product retrieval, quick corrective action implementation, or company history of fast recall resolutions. I would update lower with data showing longer typical closure times for similar recalls or news of complications in this specific case.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
