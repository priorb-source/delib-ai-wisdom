    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: tight window, no signaling, neutral-ground bias, and strong political/optical constraints. They add useful operational detail (e.g., visible advance signals, NOTAMs, schedule holds) and emphasize that a two-to-three-week sprint is difficult but not impossible if a breakthrough occurs. No new hard evidence was introduced, but their calibration puts more weight on a late‑June surprise following a concrete peace step. I find their reasoning sound; it nudges me to acknowledge a slightly fatter tail than my initial 5%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about a month, and there are no public indicators of a Moscow trip. The Kremlin has tied any high‑level Trump–Putin summit to tangible results from the June 2 Istanbul talks. Trump’s late‑May comments (“absolutely crazy,” and a two‑week wait‑and‑see) push any plausible engagement to mid‑to‑late June. Even with progress, the modal venue for initial high‑level contact is neutral territory, not Russia, given optics during active hostilities and security/logistics. A Moscow trip in June would likely require either: (a) a credible ceasefire/roadmap announced in early/mid‑June plus rapid, overt planning signals; or (b) a deliberate, surprise, optics‑driven move that the White House and Kremlin both prioritize—still atypical given risks. Absent clear breakthrough signals in the days after June 2 (ceasefire framework, joint statements, travel prep indicators), odds should decay quickly. Still, Trump’s tolerance for unconventional diplomacy, mutual invitations from February, and the possibility of a late‑June capstone photo‑op create a non‑zero tail. Balancing these, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect that tail while keeping the base case strongly No.",
