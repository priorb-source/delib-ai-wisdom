    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on March 13, 2025 as the operative licensing milestone and the point that the map can flip once minimum regulatory/operational conditions are met (even before full distribution) is a useful clarification and aligns with recent African rollouts. The end-of-quarter batch-flip pattern also supports a June activation. Forecaster 3’s caution around older 6–12 month lags and the lack of visible precursors is noted, but I find that less diagnostic given Starlink’s tendency to flip availability with minimal advance signaling and the faster 2025 cadence. Overall, F2’s framing (license-to-availability often 10–16 weeks recently, with lasers reducing gateway dependence) is slightly more persuasive than F3’s heavier weight on inertia and older base rates.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: (1) If March 13 is the effective go-ahead, July 1 sits at ~16 weeks—midrange of recent Africa lags (DRC ≈10, Malawi/Zambia ≈16, Benin ≈24). (2) Niger’s launch the same day suggests regional readiness; (3) a newly announced Airtel Africa partnership could smooth import/distribution in Chad; (4) SpaceX often flips multiple African markets near quarter-end, and June 30 fits the cutoff. Counterweights: Chad’s smaller market, customs/type approvals, and potential pricing/payment frictions could slip go-live into early Q3. Weighing F2’s arguments nudges me slightly upward: the map-based resolution and Q2 batching make a late-June flip plausible, while the absence of public precursors isn’t strongly predictive. I’m increasing my forecast modestly from 57% to 58% to reflect slightly higher confidence in a Q2 activation, while keeping a substantial chance of slippage past July 1.",
