    "review": "Both forecasters align with my initial take: short window, exact‑phrase constraint, and NYT style norms make this unlikely. Forecaster 3 usefully stresses that the search requires exact adjacency, so “reverse repurchase” (the standard finance term) would not qualify—this reduces the fallback finance-path probability. Forecaster 2’s mention of a possible “reverse purchase agreement” seems even less likely given prevailing usage, which nudges odds down slightly. Otherwise, their arguments mirror mine on translation choices and the 6/18 hook as a modest catalyst.",
    "rationale": "Nothing in their analyses suggests a new avenue that increases likelihood; if anything, the clarification that standard finance phrasing won’t match the query trims tail risk. The only plausible Yes path remains an NYT China-consumer trend piece or newsletter quoting state media or social media with the exact words “reverse purchasing,” which is possible around 6/18 but still rare given NYT’s translation/editorial preferences. Therefore I edge down slightly from 7% to 6%.",
