    "review": "My initial forecast was closely aligned with the other two experts, but they were both slightly more pessimistic. We all correctly identified the primary obstacles: the unresolved national security demand for data interception and the missed April launch deadline. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly their emphasis on the fact that security negotiations were still at a 'preliminary stage' as of late March. This detail, combined with the concrete evidence of the missed deadline, suggests that the bureaucratic inertia and complexity of the problem are more significant than I initially weighted. They didn't raise wholly new evidence, but their framing reinforced the strength of the negative signals over the vaguer positive ones (like the initial license grant).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my prediction from 35% to 30%. The consensus among the three of us is that a 'No' outcome is most likely, and my colleagues have persuaded me that my initial optimism was slightly too high. The core of the argument remains unchanged: the primary blocker is the Sri Lankan government's demand for data interception capabilities, a complex national security issue where negotiations were only at a 'preliminary stage' in late March 2025. This type of discussion typically takes months, not the few weeks remaining before the deadline. The most compelling piece of evidence is the missed April 2025 launch date, which demonstrates that the existing hurdles have already caused significant delays and that optimistic timelines are not being met. While a swift political resolution is possible, the evidence for ongoing delay is much stronger than the evidence for an imminent breakthrough. Adjusting to 30% better reflects the high probability that these substantial issues will not be resolved in the short time remaining.",
