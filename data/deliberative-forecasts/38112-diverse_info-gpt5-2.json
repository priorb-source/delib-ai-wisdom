    "review": "New and material points from both forecasters: (1) April 2025 foreign ministers reportedly failed to produce a joint communiqué—strong evidence of intra-BRICS friction that raises the bar for unanimity on enlargement. I hadn’t incorporated that. (2) Celso Amorim’s May 11 comment that BRICS should “stabilise where it is,” plus draft agendas prioritizing financial issues, are credible host signals to pause expansion. (3) The tiered ‘partner’ pathway suggests a deliberate, gradualist approach—also consistent with consolidation after 2023/early-2025 additions. I find these arguments persuasive and directionally consistent with my own caution about unanimity constraints, but they increase my confidence that the near-term baseline is no invitation. I think Forecaster 3 may slightly overweight host agenda power versus behind-the-scenes pressure from China/Russia, but Brazil’s stance matters a lot since any member can block. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the failed communiqué is particularly compelling for lowering odds.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The base case is consolidation in 2025. Unanimity is now harder with 10 members; April’s failed communiqué indicates unresolved divisions; Brazil’s public preference to pause plus India’s traditional caution reduce the probability of consensus on any specific candidate by early July. The partner framework provides a face-saving mechanism to manage demand without committing to full membership, and several pipeline candidates are either controversial (e.g., Belarus, Cuba) or not fully engaged (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam have not confirmed partner participation), while Kazakhstan has ruled out seeking full membership. With roughly five weeks left, there are no clear ‘smoke signals’ of an agreed candidate. Countervailing considerations keep the probability above very low levels: expansion remains a strategic goal for China/Russia; a single, lower-controversy invitation from the partner pool (e.g., a Southeast Asian or African state acceptable to India and Brazil) is conceivable as a late compromise, and invitations can occur before the summit window. Triggers to move up would be credible leaks or ministerial communiqués naming a consensus candidate or Brazilian softening; triggers to move down would be explicit Brazilian/Indian statements ruling out 2025 enlargement or a finalized summit agenda excluding membership decisions. Balancing these, I lower my forecast from 30% to 20%.",
