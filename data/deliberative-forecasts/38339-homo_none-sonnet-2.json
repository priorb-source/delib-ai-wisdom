    "review": "All three forecasters independently converged on 20%, which is significant corroboration. The key arguments are remarkably aligned: (1) 24-25 days is extremely short for formal international agreement cancellation, (2) strong status quo bias against rapid change, (3) complete absence of recent information suggesting imminent action, and (4) acknowledgment of genuine underlying pressures. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point I hadn't fully articulated - both parties likely prefer renegotiation over cancellation given geopolitical and economic interdependencies. This further strengthens the case for agreement continuation. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the lenient resolution criteria (announcement only, even if disputed), which I had noted but perhaps underweighted - this does provide multiple pathways to YES. However, the most critical shared observation is the complete lack of any recent information indicating imminent action. Political engagement and financial distress from older articles establish that problems exist, but provide zero evidence these issues are coming to a head in the next 25 days specifically. The consensus reasoning is sound and I find no compelling argument to deviate from it.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my 20% forecast. The convergence among all forecasters on this probability, using independent reasoning paths, provides strong validation. The key factors remain: (1) Extremely short 25-day window makes formal cancellation highly unlikely through normal diplomatic/legal channels, (2) Zero evidence of recent developments, active negotiations, or imminent announcements - this is perhaps the strongest factor against YES, (3) Strong institutional inertia favoring agreement continuation, (4) Both parties likely prefer renegotiation to cancellation. However, 20% (not lower) remains appropriate because: the financial crisis is genuine, high-level political engagement has occurred, the resolution criteria is lenient requiring only announcement by one party, and crisis situations occasionally produce faster-than-normal outcomes. The probability would need to move significantly higher only with concrete evidence of imminent action, which is entirely absent. It could move lower if we had evidence of successful debt restructuring or explicit commitments to continuation, which we also lack.",
