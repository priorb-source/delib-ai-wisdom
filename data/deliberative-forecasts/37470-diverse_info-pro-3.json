    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was significantly lower than my peers' (35% and 45%). Their analyses presented several convincing arguments that I had either overlooked or failed to weigh appropriately. Forecaster 2 made a critical point by suggesting a 12-24 month announcement window is plausible for such federations, which contrasts with the 24-36 month period I had assumed. This reframes the timeline from being exceptionally late to simply tight. They also highlighted Egypt's hosting of the WKF Senior World Championships in November 2025, which is a much stronger and more current signal of capacity and government support than the 2014 event I had focused on. Forecaster 3 rightly emphasized the recency of the high-level meeting (April 29, 2025), suggesting that this is not old news but an active, ongoing process that could conclude quickly. Their reasoning collectively exposed an overly pessimistic bias in my initial assessment, which was too anchored on the lack of official website updates and a potentially inaccurate assumption about typical timelines.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast upward. My initial assessment was too low, primarily based on the short timeline and lack of public documentation on the ITKF website. However, the other forecasters presented compelling counter-evidence. The argument that a 12-24 month pre-event announcement window is plausible means a decision before July 1, 2025, is not as unusual as I first believed. More importantly, the evidence of Egypt's current and demonstrable capability, evidenced by their hosting of the major WKF World Championships in late 2025, shows that they have the immediate infrastructure and political backing required. This, combined with the very recent high-level meeting between Egypt's Sports Minister and the ITKF President, indicates strong momentum that could reasonably lead to a formal announcement within the next seven weeks. I am increasing my forecast from 15% to 35%. I am not raising it further because the core impediments I initially identified still hold weight: international federations can be bureaucratic and slow, and the complete absence of any formal bid documentation on the ITKF's official channels remains a significant negative indicator. Additionally, Forecaster 2's point about a potential lag between an internal decision and a formal public announcement is a valid reason for caution.",
