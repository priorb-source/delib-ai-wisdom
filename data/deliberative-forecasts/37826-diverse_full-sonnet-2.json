    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several compelling points that warrant updating my forecast downward. Most critically, Forecaster 3 emphasizes that strikes in Pakistan proper (the four provinces specified) are historically extremely rare - Balakot 2019 being an exceptional case. Most Indo-Pak kinetic exchanges occur along the Line of Control in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which would NOT satisfy this question's resolution criteria. This is a crucial distinction I underweighted. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about timing - India launching attacks during its own high-profile diplomatic offensive (through June 5) would be strategically self-defeating. This creates a stronger constraint than I initially weighted. Both forecasters appropriately recognize that strikes deep into Pakistan proper represent a higher escalation threshold than LoC exchanges, requiring exceptional provocation. However, I believe they may slightly underweight: (1) the very recent precedent of Operation Sindoor striking Pakistan proper just weeks ago, (2) the explicitly stated aggressive doctrine and pre-authorized response capability, and (3) the fact we're only 12 days from active combat operations. The risk isn't negligible, but the base rate argument, diplomatic timing constraint, and de-escalation momentum are stronger than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon careful review, I'm updating my forecast significantly downward from 30% to 18%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) Historical base rates - strikes in the four specified Pakistani provinces are extremely rare, with most Indo-Pak kinetic activity occurring along the LoC in disputed Kashmir, which wouldn't count for this question. (2) The diplomatic offensive through June 5 creates a strong institutional constraint against military action that would undermine India's own messaging. (3) The ceasefire and planned troop withdrawals indicate both sides accepted de-escalation, with international pressure reinforcing restraint. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because: (1) Operation Sindoor just demonstrated India's willingness to strike Pakistan proper very recently, (2) The 'no tolerance' doctrine and pre-authorized commander authority create a lower threshold for response than in typical peacetime, (3) Only 12 days have passed since active hostilities - tensions remain acute, (4) A major terrorist attack or significant ceasefire violation could still trigger a kinetic response within June. The probability remains material but lower than my initial assessment.",
