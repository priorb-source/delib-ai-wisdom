  "information": "Several major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current trend reported by major oilfield service companies is one of declining drilling activity in North America. Projecting this trend forward for five weeks suggests the rig count will continue to fall or remain at a low level, likely below the 583 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant and sustained rally in oil and/or natural gas prices, perhaps triggered by a major geopolitical event, could incentivize a rapid increase in drilling activity. If enough producers respond quickly, the rig count could stabilize and tick up to 583 or higher by the end of May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current environment of capital discipline and focus on operational efficiency continues. Major producers maintain their drilling programs, but smaller operators remain on the sidelines or reduce activity due to cost pressures and modest commodity prices. This leads to a slight but steady decline or stagnation in the overall rig count, keeping it below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is based primarily on the prevailing trend of declining drilling activity in North America, as reported by major oilfield service companies for Q1 2025. The reports from Halliburton (declining profits) and Baker Hughes (10% sequential drop in oilfield services revenue) are strong indicators of a broad-based market slowdown. This suggests that the baseline trend heading into the second quarter is negative. Given the short 5-week timeframe, this current trend is the most significant factor.\n\nThe information about Occidental Petroleum's large capital expenditure plan is a notable counterpoint, but I interpret it as evidence of consolidation rather than broad market growth. Large, efficient producers like Occidental can maintain robust drilling programs while the overall industry activity, driven by hundreds of smaller operators, declines. A single company's plan, even a large one, is unlikely to reverse the entire industry trend in such a short period.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the 583 threshold is not dramatically lower than the likely current count, meaning a small reversal or stabilization in the trend could flip the outcome. The energy market is also susceptible to high-impact events; a sudden price spike could alter producer sentiment and drilling plans, although it often takes more than a few weeks for such changes to be fully reflected in the rig count. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the evidence from the service companies, which have a comprehensive view of the entire market, is very compelling. The structural shift towards capital discipline and efficiency gains (i.e., producing more with fewer rigs) has been a multi-year trend and is unlikely to reverse without a strong and sustained price signal, which is not currently present.\n\nI would increase my forecast's probability if weekly rig count reports in late April and early May show a consistent downward trend. I would decrease my probability if there is a sharp, sustained rally in WTI crude prices above $90/barrel or if other major producers announce unexpected increases to their drilling programs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
