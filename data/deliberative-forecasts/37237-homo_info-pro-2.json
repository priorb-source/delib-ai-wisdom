    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the expected outcome, with all of us forecasting a low probability of a 'Yes'. The core reasoning is consistent: the imposition of significant new tariffs in April 2025 is a major economic shock that makes a year-over-year increase in imports highly unlikely. I found the other analysts' contributions very valuable as they reinforced and added new dimensions to my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's point about the record-high March imports due to 'front-running' the tariffs is an excellent one. It provides a powerful causal explanation for why a sharp drop in April is not just likely but almost inevitable, as businesses digest their pre-bought inventory. Forecaster 3 provided more granular, high-frequency shipping data (e.g., 'blank sailings', lower container rates) which serves as direct, compelling evidence that the predicted slowdown is already occurring. They also rightly pointed out the countervailing effect of trade diversion to Mexico, a factor that needs to be considered in any complete analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, my conviction that 'No' is the most probable outcome has been strengthened. The combination of the real-time data indicating a severe contraction, the causal mechanism of inventory front-running in March, and the granular shipping data all point in the same direction. However, my fellow forecasters have convinced me that my initial 5% probability may have been overly confident and underweighted some sources of uncertainty. They correctly highlight several plausible, if individually unlikely, factors that could inflate the final import value. These include a sudden spike in commodity prices (like oil), the impact of inflation on nominal values, and the possibility that trade diversion to non-tariffed countries could be more rapid than anticipated. The final Census Bureau number is a complex aggregate, and its relationship to any single real-time data source is imperfect. Therefore, I am making a modest upward adjustment to my forecast. This change is not because I believe a 'Yes' outcome is more likely, but to better reflect the combined uncertainty inherent in the measurement process and the potential for outlier events, as highlighted by my colleagues. I am increasing my forecast from 5% to 10%, acknowledging their valuable input on the potential variance in the final outcome.",
