  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents are in drought, which is above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Florida rainy season, which begins June 1, starts particularly strong and early. One or more tropical systems or depressions bring widespread, soaking rain to populous areas of the state, causing the number of residents in drought to fall below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The start of the rainy season is delayed or weaker than average. Rainfall during June is insufficient to overcome the significant precipitation deficits accumulated over the past several months. The number of residents in drought conditions remains above 14.0 million on June 28, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the status quo. Currently, 14.5 million residents are in drought, 500,000 above the 14.0 million threshold. Given the short, one-month forecast window, this is a significant starting point. The drought is described as severe, with some regions 6-10 inches below average rainfall, a deficit that is difficult to erase quickly. Furthermore, a NOAA forecast specifically cited persistence of drought conditions in South Florida through June, which lends strong support to the 'Yes' outcome. The primary factor that could lead to a 'No' outcome is the onset of Florida's rainy season and the Atlantic hurricane season, both beginning on June 1. An active start, particularly a slow-moving tropical system, could rapidly alleviate drought conditions across large populated areas. The forecast for an above-average hurricane season increases the chance of such an event. However, it only takes one month of near-average or below-average rainfall for the current status to hold. The severity of the existing drought makes it more resilient to short-term rainfall. Therefore, I assign a high probability to the number of residents in drought remaining above 14.0 million. My forecast is not higher because a single, well-placed tropical storm—a distinct possibility in June during a predicted active season—could dramatically and quickly alter the situation. My forecast is not lower because overcoming a deep, widespread drought in just one month requires significantly above-average rainfall, which is not guaranteed, and the current conditions and expert forecasts suggest persistence is the more likely outcome. I would increase my forecast if the first two weeks of June are dry, and decrease it if a significant tropical system is forecast to make landfall in Florida.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
