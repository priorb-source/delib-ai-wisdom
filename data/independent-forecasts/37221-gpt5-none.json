    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~2 days (Eurostat flash for April due Apr 30; Trading Economics typically updates the same day)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent headline Euro Area inflation has been in the mid‑2s YoY, above 2.2%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Headline HICP prints at 2.2% or lower due to sharper-than-expected goods and energy disinflation, weak food inflation, and/or broad-based downside surprises in large economies (e.g., Germany, France, Spain) plus possible downward revisions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Headline HICP comes in around 2.3–2.6% as services remain sticky, energy is neutral-to-firm, and the timing of Easter in April 2025 (vs March 2024) boosts travel/hospitality prices, lifting the annual rate.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The latest available readings have Euro Area headline inflation in the mid‑2% range, and February was revised down modestly without breaking the general mid‑2s pattern. A move below 2.2% in April would require a notable downside surprise versus recent momentum.\n- Easter timing effect: In 2025, Easter falls in April (it was in March in 2024). That tends to raise April services prices (travel, hospitality), which can nudge the headline higher year-on-year compared with April 2024 that lacked Easter effects. This tilts the balance toward >2.2%.\n- Energy and goods: While core goods disinflation and soft food inflation continue to cap headline, energy prices have not collapsed recently; absent a fresh negative energy shock, it’s harder to see a drop below 2.2%.\n- Why not higher: Persistent disinflationary forces in goods and food, ongoing economic softness, and the recent downward revision to February signal underlying pressure toward lower inflation, limiting upside well above mid‑2s.\n- Why not lower: Services inflation remains sticky, and the April Easter effect likely prevents a sharp headline drop this month.\n- What would change my view: Preliminary national prints (not yet out as of Apr 28) from Germany/Spain/France materially surprising to the downside would push me lower; any upside surprises in services or energy would push me higher. Also, if Trading Economics were to post an April flash below 2.2% (or signal a definitional change), I would revise accordingly.\n- Research assistant inputs: None beyond the prompt; no additional data provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
