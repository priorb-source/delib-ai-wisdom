    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent further changes, the tracker is unlikely to reach ≥120 “Done” objectives by July 1 unless it is already at or above that level today.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current “Done” count is well below 120 and increases only modestly over the next six weeks. This could happen if a non–Project 2025–aligned administration is in office (most objectives are not pursued), or if implementation/proof standards used by the tracker are stringent and slow to confirm items as Done.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A Project 2025–aligned administration is in office and has already logged a large number of early executive actions, personnel moves, and reversals aligned with the objectives, with the tracker either already at ≥120 or adding enough newly confirmed items to cross 120 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key driver is the underlying political/implementation environment and the tracker’s current baseline, which I cannot verify today. I therefore lean on base rates and scenario weighting.\n\nBase rates and pace: Even with an aligned administration, reaching 120 confirmed “Done” items by early July requires either (a) a very granular objective list where many small actions count, or (b) rapid confirmation by the tracker of a large wave of actions. Early administrations can issue many EOs and personnel changes quickly, but trackers often apply evidentiary standards and lag in marking items as Done. Hitting 120 within ~5 months is ambitious unless the current count is already high.\n\nScenario weighting:\n- If a non-aligned administration is in office, the probability of ≥120 is near zero; most Project 2025 objectives would not be pursued, and incidental overlap would be limited.\n- If an aligned administration is in office, a midyear tally ≥120 is plausible but not guaranteed. It depends on how many objectives the tracker has already confirmed by mid-May and how granular their objective list is. Without visibility into the current count, I estimate a moderate chance in this scenario.\n\nStatus quo emphasis: Because the world usually changes slowly and confirmation lags are common, I give extra weight to the status quo: unless the tracker is already close to or above 120, the remaining ~6 weeks may be insufficient to cross the threshold.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) It’s hard to accumulate and confirm 120 items this quickly; (2) in the scenario where the administration is not aligned, chances are negligible; (3) tracker methodology/lag may slow the count.\n\nWhy not lower: There remains a material chance that an aligned administration has already implemented many objectives and that the tracker is either near 120 or can add a burst of confirmations before July 1.\n\nWhat would update me upward: Evidence that (a) the current “Done” count is already near or above ~100, (b) the tracker’s objective list is highly granular, and/or (c) a recent acceleration in confirmations. Downward: confirmation that the current count is far below 120 (e.g., <70), that the administration is not aligned with Project 2025, or that the tracker rarely marks items as Done.\n\nResearch assistant input: None provided, so the forecast reflects structural/base-rate reasoning and explicit scenario uncertainty.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
