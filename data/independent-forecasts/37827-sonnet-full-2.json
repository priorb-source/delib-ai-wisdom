  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. Today is May 22, 2025, the question covers June 2025, and will be resolved by July 1, 2025 when Metaculus checks the NUFORC database.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Based on historical patterns, pilot reports from Africa to NUFORC are extremely rare (4-6 over 10 years), so the default expectation is that no such report will occur in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The typical pattern continues where no pilots operating in African airspace observe and report UFOs to NUFORC during June 2025, or any observations are reported by non-pilots, or reports are filed but not yet posted by the July 1st resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot flying in African airspace observes an unusual aerial phenomenon in June 2025 and files a detailed report with NUFORC, which is subsequently posted to their database before the July 1st check.",
    "rationale": "Historical data shows 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024), yielding a base rate of 0.4-0.6 reports per year, or approximately 0.033-0.05 per month. This translates to roughly 3-5% probability for any given month using simple frequency analysis. However, several factors inform my forecast: The January 1, 2025 Rwanda pilot report represents unusual recent activity - if this were sustained it would vastly exceed the historical rate, but this is likely statistical noise rather than a trend. Pilot reports constitute only ~1% of NUFORC's 5,000-6,000 annual global reports, and Africa's lower aviation density compared to North America and Europe reduces exposure opportunities. The status quo strongly suggests continuation of the rare reporting pattern, as systemic changes in aviation, reporting culture, or UAP activity would be needed to significantly alter this baseline. I weight the forecast slightly above the pure historical base rate (settling on 6%) to account for: (1) the recent Rwanda report suggesting non-zero probability, (2) some variance in monthly rates, and (3) modest uncertainty in the underlying data. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of systematic changes in African aviation reporting patterns, UAP activity, or NUFORC engagement from the region. It's not lower because the base rate, while small, is demonstrably non-zero, and completely dismissing the possibility would be overconfident given limited data. I would update higher if additional African pilot reports emerged in May, if news coverage increased UFO awareness among African aviation communities, or if military/government sources reported increased UAP activity in the region. I would update lower if we reach late May with no further reports, or if analysis revealed the historical reports were concentrated in specific years (suggesting even more sporadic patterns than average rates suggest).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
