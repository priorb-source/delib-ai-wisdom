  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month; Glastonbury runs June 25–29, 2025, so the outcome should be known by June 29.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kneecap are currently on the official lineup (West Holts), and they continue to play some UK shows despite controversy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury drops Kneecap from the lineup following political/press pressure or police/security advice; or bail conditions or a court order arising from the June 18 hearing effectively prevent the act from performing and organizers don’t permit the other members to perform as Kneecap; or the band withdraws.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The festival keeps them on the bill and they perform their scheduled set on West Holts; or, if one member faces restrictions, the remaining members perform under the name Kneecap with organizer approval.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the assistant’s report: one member (Liam Óg/“Mo Chara”) was charged May 21 under Section 13 (alleged Hezbollah flag display), with a June 18 court date; Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is investigating two separate pieces of footage; several venues and European festivals (e.g., Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, Hurricane and Southside) have canceled; yet some UK shows are proceeding (Wide Awake on May 24 confirmed; surprise London gig on May 22 occurred). As of late May, Glastonbury still lists Kneecap on West Holts and organizers have made no public change.\n\nReasoning: The base rate for already-announced Glastonbury acts to perform is very high. Glastonbury historically tolerates politically charged artists and tends to resist last-minute lineup changes unless there’s a strong operational, legal, or safety reason. The fact that UK shows are still proceeding post-charge indicates there are not (so far) bail conditions that bar performing, which slightly favors a performance going ahead. Importantly for resolution, the criterion allows a Yes even if one member is barred, provided others perform as “Kneecap.” That lowers the threshold for a Yes outcome.\n\nWhy not higher: Countervailing signals include (1) a formal terrorism-related charge with a hearing one week before the festival (timing could trigger renewed media pressure and potential bail conditions), (2) multiple cancellations by other organizers (including major German festivals), and (3) public calls by politicians and ministers to remove them, which could prompt Glastonbury, or police advising the festival, to act for reputational or security reasons. Any new footage, charges, or explicit police/CPS guidance could push organizers to cancel.\n\nWhy not lower: Despite controversy, UK events have not universally canceled; a London festival the same week is going ahead. Glastonbury has so far kept them on the bill and has a track record of standing by bookings. Even if one member faces restrictions after June 18, the remaining members can still legally perform as Kneecap, which would satisfy the question’s criteria.\n\nWhat would move me up: A public statement from Glastonbury affirming the booking; the June 18 hearing passing without restrictive bail conditions; additional UK venues confirming upcoming Kneecap shows post-hearing; police indicating no specific security concerns for Glastonbury.\n\nWhat would move me down: Glastonbury or the West Holts team signaling “monitoring” or “review,” police/security advisory against the performance, new charges or explicit bail conditions that impede performing, or a cascade of UK venue/festival cancellations in early-to-mid June.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
