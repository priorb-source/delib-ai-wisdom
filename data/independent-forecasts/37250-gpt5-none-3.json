    "no_outcome_scenario": "He remains outside the U.S. because the removal order’s reentry bars and required DHS consent/waiver or court-ordered return do not materialize within the next two months; no public report of a U.S. entry occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He is granted humanitarian parole or DHS consent to reapply for admission and flies back; or a court orders DHS to facilitate his return; or he reenters and is publicly documented by credible sources (e.g., news or official records).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/legal barriers: After a deportation, reentry typically requires DHS consent to reapply or parole; otherwise statutory bars (often 5–10 years) apply. Court-ordered returns are rare and usually take longer than a couple of months. Given only ~2 months remain, timelines are tight for approvals, travel, and public reporting.\n- Public reporting constraint: The question requires credible sources confirming entry. Even if he attempted to reenter irregularly, a Yes resolution would usually require apprehension or otherwise verifiable reporting—events that are relatively unlikely within the short window.\n- Base rates: High-profile deportees sometimes secure return via humanitarian parole or litigation, but such outcomes usually take many months to years. Returns within a few months are uncommon.\n- Information state: The research assistant reports no additional information (no signs of ongoing litigation progress, DHS statements, congressional intervention, or campaign momentum). With no indicators of imminent action, lean toward the status quo (No) outcome.\nWhy not higher: The legal and administrative hurdles plus the short timeline make a return by July 1 unlikely.\nWhy not lower: A small probability remains for an exceptional humanitarian parole, a sudden court action, or a documented reentry.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of (1) a filed and fast-moving lawsuit seeking his return with near-term hearings, (2) DHS/CBP/ICE acknowledging consideration or approval of parole or consent to reapply, or (3) strong congressional intervention or advocacy indicating imminent travel.\nWhat would move me down: Evidence of strict enforcement posture in his case (e.g., criminal grounds of removal with long bars), lack of legal representation, or statements indicating no pending requests for parole/waivers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
