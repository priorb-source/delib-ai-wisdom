    "review": "Both forecasters provide excellent analyses that align closely with my original reasoning. Key strengths include: (1) Forecaster 3's specific mention of the 2017 NPD case where the Court found anti-constitutional aims but still declined to ban due to 'lack of potential' - this is an important precedent showing how high the bar is even when violations are found; (2) Both forecasters provide more granular procedural detail about the filing requirements and timeline constraints; (3) Their explicit frameworks for what would move them up or down are well-structured. I find no flaws in their reasoning. The core analysis is identical across all three forecasts: the procedural barriers are immense, the timeline is prohibitively short, no formal petition has been filed, and historical precedent strongly favors the status quo. The only meaningful difference is whether to forecast 1% or 2%, which at these low probabilities is essentially a rounding decision rather than a substantive disagreement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain my core reasoning but update slightly downward. The additional detail about the NPD precedent reinforces just how difficult party bans are - even when the Court found anti-constitutional aims, they declined to ban. This strengthens the case for an even lower probability. With approximately 60 days remaining, no formal petition filed, and the need for multiple procedural steps (filing, acceptance, evidence gathering, hearings, deliberation, ruling), the timeline is simply not feasible under normal circumstances. The only scenario for a Yes outcome would require: (1) immediate filing this week, (2) unprecedented emergency acceptance and expedited process by the Court, (3) completion of all proceedings within 8 weeks. This would represent a complete departure from German legal tradition. While I cannot rule out some extraordinary development we're unaware of, the consensus around 1% appropriately reflects the near-impossibility of this outcome. I'm updating from 2% to 1% to align with the strong consensus and the reinforcing precedent about the NPD case.",
