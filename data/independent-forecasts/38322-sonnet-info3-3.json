  "information": "American consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until the final Friday of June 2025 (June 27, 2025) when the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report is expected to be published.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the index remains at or above 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or modestly improves as the economy shows resilience, tariff concerns ease or don't materialize as severely as feared, employment remains steady, and the cautious consumer behavior described (higher savings, focus on essentials) doesn't translate into a crisis-level collapse in sentiment. The index stays at 54.0 or above.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment continues its plunge as tariff impacts hit household budgets harder than expected, prices surge on imported goods, job losses mount, debt pressures worsen significantly, and pessimism about the economic outlook deepens dramatically. These factors combine to push the index below the 54.0 threshold within the next three weeks.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 54.0 is historically very low - this would represent one of the worst consumer sentiment readings on record. During the 2008 financial crisis, the index bottomed around 55-60, and even during the 2022 inflation surge it hit approximately 50 at its lowest. The research assistant's report shows consumers are indeed cautious (low spending growth of 0.2%, elevated savings at 4.9%, student loan delinquencies at 7.74%), and the Axios article references a sentiment 'plunge' related to tariffs. However, these indicators suggest worried but not apocalyptic consumer psychology. With only 23 days until measurement, there's limited time for sentiment to deteriorate to such historically low levels unless we're already very close to that threshold. The status quo bias suggests that absent major shocks, sentiment won't move dramatically in 3 weeks. My forecast is not higher because 54.0 is an extreme threshold that requires true economic crisis conditions, and gradual pressures like debt and cautious spending don't typically cause such dramatic drops in short timeframes. My forecast is not lower because the mention of a sentiment 'plunge' and tariff concerns suggests real downward momentum, and if the current level is in the 55-60 range, dropping below 54 is plausible but not likely. To update higher, I would need: evidence that sentiment is already at or near 54, major negative economic shocks occurring, or data showing accelerating deterioration. To update lower, I would need: confirmation that current sentiment is well above 60, tariff relief announcements, or positive economic surprises.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
