    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2's mention of the SAFE for America Act as active legislation is significant - this provides a legislative route for addressing the Diversity Visa, potentially reducing the need for executive action. Forecaster 3's point about the DV-2025 lottery results being released on May 3rd is particularly interesting timing information that could serve as either a catalyst or, conversely, a missed opportunity (two weeks have passed since then without action). Both forecasters emphasize the statutory nature of the program, which limits what executive action can meaningfully accomplish - this is a crucial constraint I underweighted. I find Forecaster 3's framing of the 4-month pattern particularly compelling; establishing a baseline of 'no action despite intensive immigration activity' is strong evidence against sudden change. However, I'm slightly less convinced by arguments about the timeframe being too short - 42 days is substantial given Trump's demonstrated velocity of executive actions. The convergence around 20-28% suggests reasonable consensus, though Forecaster 3's lower estimate reflects greater weight on the established pattern.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward based on three key considerations. First, the existence of active legislation (SAFE for America Act) suggests the administration may prefer a legislative solution that would be more durable and comprehensive than executive action. Second, the statutory nature of the Diversity Visa program significantly limits what executive action can accomplish - any action would likely be symbolic or procedural rather than substantive elimination. Third, the 4-month pattern without action is strong evidence; if this were a genuine priority, we likely would have seen action during the initial wave of immigration executive orders in February. The DV-2025 results being released on May 3rd is interesting timing, but two weeks have passed without catalyzing action. That said, I'm not adjusting dramatically lower because: (1) Trump's documented opposition to the program is clear, (2) 42 days remains meaningful time, (3) Trump has shown willingness to issue executive actions even when their legal authority or practical effect is limited (see birthright citizenship order), and (4) he could issue even a symbolic or procedural action mentioning the program. The probability remains in the 20-30% range, reflecting that while this outcome is unlikely, it's far from impossible given Trump's immigration focus and penchant for executive action.",
