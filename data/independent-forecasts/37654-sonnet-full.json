  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46-47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'In progress' without being updated to 'Complete'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "While NOAA continues to experience budget cuts, staff departures, and operational changes like the discontinued disasters database, no formal executive order or legislation is signed before July 1 that formally breaks up the agency. The tracker moderators maintain the 'In progress' status because the strict criteria for 'Complete' (a signed executive order or enacted statute achieving the specific objective) has not been met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In mid to late June 2025, an executive order is signed that formally breaks up NOAA, reorganizing its components into separate entities or redistributing its functions to other agencies. The tracker moderators verify this formal action meets their criteria and update the status to 'Complete' before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. With only 46 days remaining, the historical timeline for similar executive reorganizations (2-6 months) suggests insufficient time for completion. The tracker's strict definition requiring a formal signed action (not just proposals or partial measures) creates a high bar. The base rate is unfavorable: only 5 of 41 in-progress items (12%) were completed over approximately 4-5 months, suggesting a low completion velocity. While significant restructuring activities are underway at NOAA (discontinued database, proposed 25% budget cut, staff departures), these actions alone don't constitute formally 'breaking up' the agency as tracked. Breaking up a major federal agency requires extensive legal vetting, administrative coordination, and formal documentation. A legislative path is essentially impossible given Senate timelines. An executive order path is theoretically possible but would require the order to be fully drafted, legally vetted, and signed within the next 6 weeks - faster than historical precedent suggests. The forecast is not lower (5-10%) because active restructuring work is occurring and executive orders can occasionally move quickly when prioritized. It's not higher (25-35%) because the tight timeframe, complexity of the task, strict completion criteria, and historical timelines all argue against completion. I would update higher if reports emerged of an executive order in final stages or imminent signing; I would update lower if June passes without clear signs of imminent formal action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
