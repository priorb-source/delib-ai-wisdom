  "information": "A late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - drought conditions persist at current levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tropical Storm Alvin and the forecasted weather systems bring substantial, sustained rainfall across California in early June, significantly reducing drought-affected areas and bringing the number of residents in drought below 20 million by late June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions, described as 'already bad' in the SF Gate article, continue through June with only modest relief from the forecasted storm systems. The approaching summer dry season prevents significant improvement, keeping 20 million or more residents in drought-affected areas.",
    "rationale": "The SF Gate article indicates California's drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad,' suggesting significant current drought conditions across the state. With California's total population around 39-40 million, the 20 million threshold represents approximately 50% of residents, which is plausible for a widespread drought described in these terms. The timing is critical: we're at the end of May approaching California's dry summer season, which typically runs June through September. While my research assistant notes potential storm activity from Tropical Storm Alvin and a Canadian low-pressure system that could bring rainfall, these represent short-term weather events. Drought conditions change slowly and typically require sustained precipitation over weeks or months to meaningfully improve. One month of sporadic rainfall during the transition into summer is unlikely to eliminate established drought conditions affecting large population centers. The status quo strongly favors continuation of current conditions - if drought is already widespread and 'bad,' it's likely to persist through late June absent extraordinary circumstances. My forecast is not higher (75-85%) because: (1) the potential storm systems could deliver above-average rainfall, (2) I lack precise current drought population figures, and (3) unexpected weather patterns could bring more sustained precipitation. My forecast is not lower (40-50%) because: (1) the article's characterization of conditions as 'already bad' suggests significant current impact, (2) we're entering the dry season, (3) drought amelioration typically requires sustained time, and (4) the 20 million threshold seems reasonable for a statewide drought in California. I would update higher with evidence that current drought population already exceeds 25 million or forecasts showing minimal June precipitation. I would update lower with data showing current drought population is well below 20 million or forecasts of sustained heavy rainfall systems throughout June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
