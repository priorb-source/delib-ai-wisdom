    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was closely aligned with Forecaster 2's reasoning (13%), which emphasized the strong pull of the status quo over a short, two-month timeframe. Both of us correctly noted that the advisory has been stable for years and that a specific, dramatic trigger is usually required for an upgrade. However, Forecaster 3's analysis (23%) introduced a critical point I had under-weighted: the direct link between the recent U.S. troop withdrawal and a potential degradation of consular support capacity. Their argument that this geopolitical shift itself constitutes a major change in the operating environment — providing a rationale for an upgrade even without a new terrorist attack — is highly convincing. This is not a hypothetical risk, but a sustained change in conditions that the State Department will have to consider in its next review.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward based on the deliberation. My initial analysis focused too heavily on the need for a new, singular security event, like a coup or a major attack on the capital, to trigger an upgrade from Level 3 to Level 4. Forecaster 3 persuasively argued that the recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger fundamentally alters the security landscape and, more importantly, the U.S. government's ability to provide emergency assistance to its citizens. This change in consular capacity is a primary factor in determining travel advisory levels, as seen in other Level 4 countries. A significant reduction in the U.S. government's footprint and support capability provides a strong, ongoing rationale for the State Department to elevate the advisory to 'Do Not Travel' as a precautionary measure during its next review cycle. While bureaucratic inertia and the short timeframe remain significant factors favoring a 'No' outcome, this specific, material change in circumstances makes an upgrade more plausible than I first estimated. I am increasing my forecast from 15% to 22% to reflect this heightened risk.",
