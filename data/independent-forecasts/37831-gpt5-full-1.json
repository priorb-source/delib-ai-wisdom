  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until 2025-07-01).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 13 dissolution stays in force and new political parties are not generally allowed to form before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The junta maintains the ban while it drafts a new, tighter legal framework. Courts either uphold the decree or slow-walk challenges. Security services deter protests and arrests continue. International criticism does not translate into leverage strong enough to induce a policy reversal within the time window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing rising domestic unrest, elite fissures, or credible external pressure (from the AU/UN or key donors), the junta issues a new decree rescinding the dissolution and reinstates a framework that broadly allows parties to operate and new parties to register before July 1; alternatively, the Supreme Court annuls the decree and the junta abides by the ruling.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In Mali and across the Sahel’s current military regimes, the trend has been consolidation of power, not rapid concessions. The May 13 decree dissolving all parties followed repeal of the law governing parties/opposition by the CNT (130–2), indicating institutional alignment behind the move. The government has signaled it wants to “rationalize” the political landscape and draft a new framework on its own timeline. With only ~40 days left, reversing course in a way that again allows general party formation is a high bar.\n\nKey factors from the assistant’s report that push the odds down:\n- Domestic legal avenues are weak and slow. The junta controls the transition, and courts in similar contexts rarely deliver fast, enforceable reversals against core regime priorities. Even if the Supreme Court were sympathetic, getting a final ruling and compliance before July 1 is unlikely.\n- Limited external leverage. Mali has already withdrawn from ECOWAS and has shown willingness to absorb international condemnation (UN, Amnesty). AU and UN criticism matters reputationally but has not historically forced quick policy U-turns in Bamako. The regime also has alternative security partnerships, reducing dependence on Western approval.\n- Regime incentives. Allowing parties back in broadly before a new framework risks mobilization and coordination among opponents. The arrests of opposition figures suggest a willingness to repress rather than accommodate in the near term.\n\nWhy the probability is not lower: There remains a nontrivial chance of a tactical concession if the costs of the ban rise quickly. Triggers could include unusually large, sustained protests, elite fractures, a credible AU-mediated roadmap tied to concrete incentives (aid, sanctions relief), or a legal development the junta deems low-cost to accept. The regime could also engineer a face-saving “temporary reinstatement” while it finalizes new rules, which would meet this market’s criterion if it generally allows new party formation.\n\nWhy it’s not higher: The short timeline, the regime’s recent trajectory (expelling UN mission, breaking with ECOWAS timelines, centralizing power), and the fact that a qualifying reversal must generally allow new party formation make a quick reversal improbable. The more likely path is maintaining the ban through July 1, then introducing a restrictive framework later.\n\nWhat would move me upward: credible reports of (1) the junta announcing a near-term date to reinstate parties; (2) a binding AU-brokered agreement with incentives/sanctions that the junta appears set to accept; (3) a Supreme Court ruling against the decree with signs of regime compliance; or (4) large, sustained protests drawing in key elites or security actors. What would move me downward: intensified repression, new decrees entrenching the ban, or public statements ruling out reinstatement before a new law, with no ongoing dialogue.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
