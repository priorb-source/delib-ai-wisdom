  "information": "Diplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-4 weeks. We are already in June 2025 (today is June 3), and G7 summits typically occur mid-to-late in the host month. The outcome will be known by the end of June 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India due to ongoing diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar case and Khalistani issues. Alternatively, Canada extends a late invitation but Modi declines, citing unresolved concerns about the safety of Indian diplomats and the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney makes a last-minute decision to invite India as part of efforts to reset bilateral relations. Modi accepts the invitation, viewing it as an opportunity to engage with G7 leaders and demonstrate diplomatic normalization with Canada under its new government.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. India is not a G7 member and must be invited as a guest. The Times of India reports that Canada has invited Australia and Ukraine but 'no call for India yet.' We are already on June 3, 2025, meaning the summit is imminent with minimal time for diplomatic choreography. While the research assistant notes that new PM Carney and Modi have exchanged positive messages about strengthening ties, India has explicitly stated concerns about Khalistani elements and diplomat safety that require resolution. These substantive issues cannot be addressed in days. Historically, G7 guest invitations are announced well in advance to allow for preparation and scheduling. A last-minute invitation would be diplomatically unusual and potentially awkward. The probability is not zero because diplomatic situations can shift rapidly, other G7 members might pressure Canada to include India, or both leaders might view attendance as a gesture toward rapprochement. However, the combination of no current invitation, very limited time, unresolved bilateral tensions, and the need for Modi to feel his attendance wouldn't be politically costly at home makes attendance highly unlikely. For me to revise upward, I would need to see: (1) an official invitation extended, (2) positive signals from Indian officials about accepting, or (3) reports of behind-the-scenes diplomatic progress on the Khalistani and diplomat safety issues. For me to revise further downward, I would need confirmation that the summit date has passed without Modi's attendance or an official statement that India was not invited or declined.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
