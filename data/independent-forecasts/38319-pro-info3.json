  "information": "The Bank of Japan's April regional economic report maintained its judgment that the Tohoku economy is \"recovering.\" The report specified that production of machinery and equipment is also \"recovering,\" driven by strong demand for semiconductors related to artificial intelligence development. A surveyed manufacturer stated they expected related product production to remain at a high level until at least the middle of 2025. Conversely, the Golden Week holidays, which fall at the end of April, typically dampen production in the region’s electronics and machinery plants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days, as the announcement is expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is 'Yes'. The most recent data for March showed a strong 7.6% month-over-month increase, and the Bank of Japan's April report described the regional economy as 'recovering,' suggesting continued positive momentum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month-over-month change is 0.0% or lower. This would likely occur if the dampening effect of the Golden Week holidays at the end of April was more significant than the underlying growth momentum. It is also possible that the strong March performance was a one-off, or a pull-forward of production in anticipation of the holidays, leading to a natural pullback in April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The month-over-month change is greater than 0.0%. This would happen if the strong demand for AI-related semiconductors and other machinery continued to drive production, overpowering the negative seasonal impact of the Golden Week holidays. This scenario sees the March increase as the beginning of a sustained recovery.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is slightly in favor of a 'Yes' outcome. The primary factors supporting this are the recent positive data and forward-looking indicators. The 7.6% production increase in March, the first in three months, signals a potential turning point. This is corroborated by the Bank of Japan's April regional report, which maintained its assessment that the Tohoku economy is 'recovering.' Crucially, the report highlights strength in machinery and equipment, fueled by robust demand for AI-related semiconductors, with surveyed manufacturers expecting this to continue through mid-2025. This underlying demand is a strong positive driver.\n\nHowever, there are significant reasons for caution, which is why my probability is not higher. First, month-over-month industrial production figures are notoriously volatile; a strong month is often followed by a weaker one. Second, the Golden Week holidays at the end of April are a known seasonal headwind that typically reduces factory operating days and dampens production. The central question is whether the underlying positive momentum is strong enough to overcome this seasonal drag and the potential for statistical reversion after a strong March.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the specific drivers mentioned—AI-related semiconductors—are part of a strong global trend that is less susceptible to minor domestic fluctuations. The positive outlook from the BoJ and local manufacturers provides a solid basis to expect the recovery to continue. I have weighted the fundamental economic trend slightly more heavily than the seasonal and statistical noise.\n\nI would increase my forecast if preliminary trade data for April showed continued high export levels for electronics and machinery from the region. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast upon news of any significant production disruptions or a sudden downturn in global semiconductor demand.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bank of Japan's April regional economic report maintained its judgment that the Tohoku economy is \"recovering.\" The report specified that production of machinery and equipment is also \"recovering,\" driven by strong demand for semiconductors related to artificial intelligence development.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
