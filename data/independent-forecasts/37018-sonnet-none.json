    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kelsea Ballerini wins at least one award in any of the three categories where she received nominations",
    "rationale": "With 3 nominations at the ACM Awards, Ballerini has multiple opportunities to win. The key factor is that winning requires success in at least one of three categories, not all three. Assuming each category has 4-6 nominees (typical for major award categories), Ballerini might have roughly 15-25% probability in each individual category depending on competition strength. Using probability mathematics: if we assume approximately 20% chance per category, the probability of winning at least one is 1-(0.8^3) = 48.8%. Ballerini is an established country artist who has won ACM awards previously, suggesting she's competitive in her nominated categories. However, without knowing the specific categories or her competition, there's significant uncertainty. The forecast is not higher because: we lack information about specific categories and competitors, and even multiple nominations don't guarantee wins. The forecast is not lower because: three nominations provide multiple chances, and she's a credible past winner with industry recognition. I would update higher if industry reports suggested she was a frontrunner in specific categories. I would update lower if the categories appeared particularly competitive or if she faced unusually strong competition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
