  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Beyond Meat continues its operations, albeit under significant financial distress, managing its liquidity to avoid a bankruptcy filing within the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company implements emergency cost-cutting measures and manages its working capital aggressively enough to maintain solvency through the end of June 2025. While its long-term viability remains in question, it avoids a bankruptcy filing before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A continued steep decline in sales leads to a more severe cash crunch than anticipated. Unable to secure additional financing or credit from lenders who have lost confidence, the board is forced to file for Chapter 11 protection to preserve remaining assets and attempt a restructuring.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant tension between Beyond Meat's severe financial distress and the very short time remaining until the resolution date. The status quo for a struggling company is to continue struggling, not to file for bankruptcy, as that is a step of last resort. The information from my research assistant confirms the company's dire situation: a 9.1% revenue decline, a net loss of $52.9 million, and a negative gross margin in Q1 2025. Withdrawing the annual forecast signals extreme uncertainty and a lack of visibility. These factors strongly suggest the company is on an unsustainable path. However, the deadline is less than two months away. Corporate bankruptcy filings are complex and typically follow a period of exploring all other options, such as securing new financing, selling assets, or finding a buyer. It is more likely than not that the company has enough cash or short-term credit to survive this brief period. My probability is not lower than 25% because the financials are alarming. A negative gross margin implies the core business is losing money on every sale, and an acute liquidity crisis could materialize quickly. My probability is not higher because organizational inertia and management's incentive to avoid bankruptcy make a filing in the next seven weeks a less probable outcome than muddling through. I would increase my forecast upon news of a failed financing round or a creditor calling a loan. I would decrease it if the company announced a significant cash infusion or a buyout agreement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBeyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
