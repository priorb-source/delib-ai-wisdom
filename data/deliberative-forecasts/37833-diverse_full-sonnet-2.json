    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that I should weigh carefully. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the deadline ambiguity (April 1 vs July 1) and provides a 5% forecast, possibly treating this as a retrospective question. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the resolution criteria uses July 1, 2025, giving ~40 days remaining, and forecasts 13%. The most important new evidence they raise: (1) Trump's X activity is not just 'rare' but EXTREMELY rare - nearly absent, which is a stronger headwind than I initially weighted; (2) The exact phrase requirement 'diversity visa' eliminates many near-misses, which is stricter than general immigration discussion; (3) Forecaster 3's point about Musk's political content dropping from 51% to 19% represents a substantial shift, not just a modest one. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning most convincing because they correctly parse the resolution criteria (July 1 deadline), acknowledge the remaining time window, and appropriately weight the structural barriers while preserving tail risk for unpredictability. My 20% now seems too high given the emphasized rarity of Trump's X usage and the exact-phrase constraint.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm revising my forecast downward. The key factors driving this change: (1) Trump's X posting is not merely 'reduced' but nearly non-existent - this is a more severe constraint than my initial analysis suggested. Even if he discusses immigration, it will almost certainly be on Truth Social. (2) The exact phrase 'diversity visa' requirement is stricter than I weighted - variations like 'visa lottery' or 'DV program' won't count. (3) With ~40 days remaining until July 1, while there's time for news cycles, the structural barriers (platform preferences, Musk's 81% non-political posting) create a very narrow pathway. However, I'm not going as low as 5% because: immigration remains Trump's signature issue, both figures are genuinely unpredictable, DV lottery results typically generate May-June discussion, and the Gold Card visa debate could spark explicit contrasts. The diversity visa program has been criticized by Trump before using this exact phrase. A single impulsive post or reply from either figure would resolve this Yes. Balancing the severe structural headwinds against the unpredictability factor and remaining time window, I'm settling at 14%.",
