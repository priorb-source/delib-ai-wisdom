  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.\n\nAs a newer political party, Reform UK does not have the established local infrastructure and grassroots organization of the main parties active in Derbyshire. The party has encountered issues with candidate vetting, including a controversy involving their candidate for Bakewell, Max Bethell, who reportedly made racial slurs on social media. Historically, predecessor parties like UKIP and the Brexit Party did not succeed in translating national support into control of county councils.\n\nNational polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks, with the election on May 1, 2025, and results expected shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Reform UK does not win the most seats; the Conservative Party remains the largest party on the council, likely with a reduced majority.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative party's incumbency advantage and established local organization allow them to retain a plurality of seats, despite losing some to Labour and Reform UK. Reform UK's national support does not translate effectively under the First-Past-The-Post system, resulting in them winning only a handful of seats, far from the required number to be the largest party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A catastrophic collapse of the Conservative vote, driven by national trends, leads to a massive and direct switch of voters to Reform UK. This support proves to be highly concentrated in specific electoral divisions, allowing Reform UK to win a plurality of seats (e.g., 25+ seats) against a fractured opposition of remaining Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural barriers facing a new party in a First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) local election, despite its high national polling. The status quo is a massive Conservative majority, holding a projected 57 of the 64 new seats. For Reform UK to go from zero seats to the largest party is an exceptionally high bar. \n\nSeveral factors support a low probability. First, the FPTP system rewards geographically concentrated support, and while Professor Curtice notes this possibility, it is a significant risk for a new party. National poll numbers often fail to translate into local seats, as predecessor parties like UKIP have demonstrated. Second, Reform UK lacks the local infrastructure, incumbency advantage, and established ground game of the Conservatives and Labour, which are crucial in local elections. Third, historical precedent shows that insurgent parties rarely succeed in taking control of county councils in this manner. Finally, reported issues with candidate vetting suggest an organization that may not be fully prepared for a comprehensive local campaign.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because the national political environment is volatile, and Reform UK's high polling (23-25%) indicates significant voter discontent with the established parties. If the Conservative vote collapses entirely and transfers almost exclusively to Reform in specific areas, a surprising outcome is not impossible, especially as they are fielding a full slate of candidates. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the combined weight of the FPTP system, the Conservative incumbency advantage, and Reform's lack of local organization makes this scenario extremely unlikely. Overcoming a 57-seat effective incumbency in a single cycle would be a political event of historic proportions. \n\nI would increase my forecast if I saw reliable, division-level polling for Derbyshire showing Reform UK with a clear lead in over 20 of the 64 seats. I would decrease it if late-stage national or regional polling showed a decline in their support or a recovery in the Conservative vote.",
