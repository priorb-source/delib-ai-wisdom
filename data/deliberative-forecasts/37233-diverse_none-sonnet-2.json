    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling strategic analyses that I hadn't fully developed. They emphasize important points: (1) strategic advantages of maintaining ambiguity to prevent successors from emerging and keep opposition off-balance, (2) historical precedent showing 2020 declaration came relatively late, and (3) critically, the absence of any scheduled RHDP party congress or convention in May that would serve as a natural venue for such an announcement. This last point is particularly significant - candidacy declarations typically occur at formal party events, and without a scheduled May congress, there's no obvious triggering mechanism. Their emphasis on October timing (making June 1 approximately 4-5 months out) reinforces that this would be unusually early. However, both landed at exactly 35%, which may indicate some anchoring. I also note they didn't emphasize Ouattara's advanced age as strongly as I did, though they acknowledge the 2020 precedent of reversing his decision. The convergence of their analyses around strategic delay and absence of concrete triggering events is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating moderately upward from 28% to 32%. The other forecasters convinced me to place more weight on: (1) the strategic benefits of delay for a seasoned political operator, (2) the lack of any scheduled party congress or nomination convention in May that would provide the formal mechanism for declaration, and (3) historical patterns suggesting declarations come closer to election dates. These are concrete factors that reduce the probability of a pre-June 1 declaration. However, I'm not updating all the way to their 35% because I continue to believe the complete absence of any public signals, reports, or speculation about imminent declaration is meaningful evidence favoring No. The 33-day window remains sufficient for an unexpected announcement, but without scheduled triggering events or insider reports suggesting May timing, the path to Yes requires either an impromptu announcement or information we simply don't have. My updated forecast balances their stronger strategic framework with my emphasis on the informational vacuum and absence of concrete plans.",
