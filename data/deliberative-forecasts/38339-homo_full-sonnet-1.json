    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses with substantial overlap with my reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes particularly compelling points about the timeframe constraint and the significance of the May 2025 negotiation focus. The emphasis on the 'pattern' of survival despite 11 months of stress is well-taken - each month that passes without cancellation despite non-payment strengthens the base case for continuation. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my own, including the 20% forecast.\n\nThe most persuasive new argument is Forecaster 2's emphasis on the recency of the May 2, 2025 talks focusing on renegotiation rather than cancellation. This was only ~5 weeks ago, which is a very strong signal about the direction both parties were heading. If cancellation were imminent, we would expect to see warning signals: ultimatums, emergency meetings, shifting rhetoric from 'renegotiate' to 'terminate,' or discussion of legal preparations. None of these appear to be present.\n\nForecaster 2's point about needing 'evidence of imminent government decision, Turkey signaling willingness, or formal termination proceedings' to update higher is well-founded. The absence of such evidence with only 24 days remaining is significant.\n\nHowever, I don't fully agree with dropping to 12% because: (1) the financial crisis genuinely is severe with bankruptcy risk, (2) the unilateral announcement criterion does meaningfully lower the bar for resolution, and (3) while 24 days is short, it's not impossible for sudden diplomatic shifts to occur under crisis conditions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating my probability downward but not as low as Forecaster 2. The key factors driving this adjustment are:\n\n**Factors supporting lower probability:**\n1. The May 2, 2025 negotiations (just 5 weeks ago) focused explicitly on renegotiation, not cancellation - this is a very recent and strong signal\n2. The 24-day timeframe is genuinely constraining for major diplomatic announcements, which typically require visible preparation\n3. No warning signals or escalating rhetoric suggesting imminent cancellation\n4. The debt settlement barrier appears practically insurmountable given Bulgaria's financial state\n5. The pattern of 11 months of survival despite non-payment strengthens the continuation base case\n\n**Factors preventing lower probability:**\n1. Bulgargaz's financial situation is genuinely dire (reported bankruptcy risk, 280 million leva loss in 2024)\n2. The unilateral announcement criterion lowers the bar - Bulgaria could theoretically make a desperate declaration\n3. 24 days, while short, is non-zero time for crisis-driven action\n4. PM Borissov's public statements indicate strong political pressure\n\nThe balance of evidence suggests the status quo will persist through July 1, 2025, but the financial crisis creates a meaningful tail risk of sudden action. My updated forecast splits the difference between Forecaster 2's 12% and my original 20%.",
