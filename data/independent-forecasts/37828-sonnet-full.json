  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.\n\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Rippling does not announce IPO plans",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling continues executing on its current strategy following the May 2025 Series G funding round. The company focuses on growth, improving profitability, and providing employee liquidity through annual tender offers as CEO Parker Conrad stated. No IPO announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent statements, Rippling experiences an unexpected catalyst - perhaps exceptional market conditions, strategic imperatives, or board pressure - that leads management to accelerate IPO plans. The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an announcement on its website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly points toward a No outcome. Most critically, CEO Parker Conrad made explicit statements in May 2025 (literally this month, days before the forecast date) that Rippling has 'no specific plans to go public' and an IPO is 'not imminent.' This timing is crucial - these aren't old statements that could be outdated, but fresh declarations made essentially concurrent with the forecast period. The company just raised $450 million in Series G funding and committed to a $200 million tender offer program, providing alternative liquidity mechanisms that reduce pressure for an IPO. Conrad also emphasized that profitability is a prerequisite for going public, and there's no indication this threshold has been met. With only ~40 days until the resolution date, the timeframe is extremely compressed for such a major corporate decision. IPO preparations typically require months of planning, SEC filings, roadshows, and coordination. While the broader tech IPO market is improving and competitors like Chime and Klarna are pursuing public listings, this doesn't override Rippling's explicit current stance. The forecast is not lower (below 3%) because: (1) CEOs sometimes provide misleading or strategic statements about IPO timing, (2) market conditions can change rapidly and create unexpected windows, and (3) there's always some tail risk of surprise announcements. The forecast is not higher (above 8%) because: (1) the CEO's statements are unambiguous, recent, and detailed, (2) the company just secured substantial private funding, (3) the timeframe is very short, and (4) no credible contrary signals exist. I would update higher if: evidence emerged of SEC engagement, leaked IPO preparations, or significant market pressure. I would update lower with: additional public statements reaffirming no IPO plans or news of further funding activities.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
