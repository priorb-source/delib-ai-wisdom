  "information": "The West Northamptonshire Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. The number of council seats has been reduced from 93 to 76 for this election, with 39 seats required for a majority. The current council composition is: 50 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 4 Reform UK, 3 Greens, and 3 Independents. The incumbent Conservative council leader, Jason Smithers, is not seeking re-election.\n\nNational polling data from late April 2025 indicates voting intentions place Reform UK at approximately 25%, Labour at 24%, and the Conservative Party at 22%. Reports suggest the Liberal Democrats are targeting Conservative-held areas with significant campaign resources, and the rise of Reform UK is expected to split the traditional Conservative vote.\n\nA recent parliamentary by-election in Wellingborough, located within the West Northamptonshire council area, saw a swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party. The 2025 election will be contested on new electoral boundaries. Political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice has predicted that nationally, Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats in the May 2025 local elections.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 11–12 days (polling 1 May; results likely by 2 May)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party (they currently hold the most seats and dominated in 2021)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour sweep most Northampton town seats, plus a few suburban/rural gains; in rural areas the Conservative vote splits with Reform UK (and some Lib Dem/Green advances), leaving Labour with a narrow plurality of total seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives retain a clear plurality across Daventry and South Northamptonshire wards, take a handful in Northampton, and benefit from opposition fragmentation (Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform splitting) so they finish as the largest group even without a majority.",
    "rationale": "Summary of key facts from the assistant’s report and context: • Seats cut from 93 to 76; 39 for a majority. • Current composition heavily favours Conservatives (50/93). • New boundaries add uncertainty. • National mood is adverse for Conservatives: late-April polling has Reform ≈25%, Labour ≈24%, Conservatives ≈22%. • Reform UK likely splits the right; Lib Dems are targeting Conservative areas; Greens competitive in some urban wards. • Local note: the Wellingborough by-election swing to Labour was in neighbouring North Northamptonshire, but it still signals county-level Conservative weakness. • The Conservative council leader isn’t restanding.   How I weigh it: - Status quo/structure: Historically, West Northamptonshire mixes Labour-leaning Northampton town with strongly Conservative Daventry and South Northamptonshire. In 2021 the Conservatives dominated; incumbency and rural geography still give them a runway to remain the largest party even if they lose many seats. I give this meaningful weight. - Headwinds: The national environment is poor for the Conservatives, and right-of-centre vote-splitting (Reform) could cost them seats. Boundary changes could also rebalance toward urban areas. The leader’s exit is a small local negative. - Opposition dynamics: Labour will likely perform strongly in Northampton. However, the Liberal Democrats start from a very low base in this council (no current seats), which limits how far and fast they can overtake large swathes of rural wards in a single cycle, even with targeted campaigns. Greens may win some urban seats but also fragment the anti-Conservative vote. Reform may win some councillors but their vote is often inefficient; Curtice’s “hundreds of seats” nationally likely translates to only a handful here. - Net effect: I expect substantial Conservative losses and no overall control, but a plausible path remains for them to finish as the largest group via residual rural strength and opposition fragmentation. This is less likely than not given the climate, but close. Why not higher: National polling puts Conservatives third; Reform and Lib Dem targeting threaten Conservative rural dominance; boundary changes and urban concentration of Labour support could tip the plurality to Labour. Why not lower: Geography, incumbency, and opposition fragmentation still favour Conservatives finishing narrowly ahead. Lib Dems’ low local base constrains their ceiling; Reform’s conversion of votes to seats is uncertain. What would move me up: Evidence that Reform is fielding few candidates locally; clear signs of strong Conservative ground game and incumbency advantage in rural wards; weak Lib Dem presence on the ballot or canvass returns showing them underperforming; higher expected turnout in rural areas. What would move me down: Ward-level polling or credible canvass data showing Labour ahead in mixed or suburban wards; confirmation that Reform and Lib Dems are fielding full strong slates across rural wards; further local Conservative defections or controversies; indications that boundary changes significantly favour Northampton wards.",
