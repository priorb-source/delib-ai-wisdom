    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective's status is currently 'in progress' and is highly likely to remain so by the deadline due to the complexity of the task. The status quo is that the world changes slowly, and completing such a major government reorganization in a short time is improbable.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new administration pursues the breakup of NOAA through legislation and executive action. However, these efforts face significant political opposition, procedural delays in Congress, and immediate legal challenges. By July 1, 2025, no definitive law has been signed or final executive order implemented, so the spreadsheet administrators leave the status as 'in progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new administration, enjoying a unified government, makes the breakup of NOAA a 'Day One' priority. It successfully fast-tracks legislation through Congress, possibly by eliminating the Senate filibuster, and a bill is signed into law before the deadline. The spreadsheet administrators see this decisive legislative action as fulfilling the objective and mark it as 'complete'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the immense difficulty of the objective compared to the extremely short timeline. The question asks if the breakup of a major federal agency, NOAA, will be marked as 'complete' by July 1, 2025. As of today, May 15, 2025, this leaves only about six weeks until the deadline, and about five months from the start of a new presidential term.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency is a monumental task involving complex legislation, bureaucratic reorganization, and significant legal hurdles. Such actions typically take years, not months, to accomplish. The US system of government is designed with numerous checks and balances that slow down radical change, even with a determined executive and a friendly Congress.\n\nThe status quo is that the objective is 'in progress'. Given the high inertia of government, the most probable outcome is that it remains 'in progress' or, at best, sees incremental advancement by the deadline. It is highly improbable that the entire process—from introduction of a plan to final, definitive action (like a signed law) that would warrant a 'complete' status—could be finished in under six months.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the 'in progress' status implies the administration is actively pursuing this goal. There is a small but non-zero chance of a political 'blitz' where a highly organized new government achieves a series of rapid, unexpected successes. This would constitute a tail-risk event.\n\nMy probability is not higher because this tail-risk scenario requires overcoming immense, baked-in procedural and political friction. Legislative calendars, committee processes, potential filibusters, and inevitable court challenges all serve as powerful brakes on such rapid, transformative change. \n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if a bill to dismantle NOAA were to pass one chamber of Congress or if a sweeping and legally robust executive order were issued and survived initial court injunctions. I would update towards an even stronger 'No' if key political actors signaled this was a longer-term project or if initial legislative efforts failed decisively.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
