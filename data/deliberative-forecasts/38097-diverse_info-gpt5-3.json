    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a concrete, falsifiable claim I hadn’t fully incorporated: that Laurent Gbagbo remains off the electoral list due to his 2018 conviction and associated loss of civic rights, with multiple late‑May 2025 reports confirming this status. That aligns with the broader record (persistent exclusion from the roll since 2020, continued disputes even after the 2022 pardon) and, if true, already satisfies the question’s resolution criteria. Forecaster 3’s argument leans on an absence‑of‑evidence inference (“they would have done it by now”), which is weak given that Gbagbo’s exclusion predates this cycle and has been repeatedly reaffirmed. On balance, F2’s reasoning is more compelling and materially changes the probability base case from “maybe” to “likely already yes.”",
    "rationale": "I initially put 38% largely due to timing and uncertainty about whether fresh exclusions would be confirmed before July 1. Forecaster 2’s point—that Laurent Gbagbo is already off the electoral list on legal grounds and that credible outlets have recently reaffirmed this—meaningfully updates the situation. If Gbagbo is currently excluded, the question is effectively already satisfied. I’m not at ~100% for two reasons: (1) small but real chance I’m overweighting F2’s premise (e.g., a recent reversal I missed), and (2) a low but nonzero chance of an abrupt political/legal move restoring Gbagbo’s civic rights and voter registration before July 1. Nonetheless, given the historical trajectory (2018 conviction, longstanding roll exclusion, 2022 pardon that didn’t clearly restore civic rights, repeated CEI/court affirmations) and the short runway, a Yes outcome is highly likely. I therefore update substantially upward from 38% to 88%.",
