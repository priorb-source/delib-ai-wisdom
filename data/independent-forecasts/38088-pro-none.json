    "status_quo_outcome": "No. On April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person was from Italy, not the United States.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Market conditions remain relatively stable, or wealth growth for non-US billionaires around the 250th rank outpaces that of their US counterparts. As a result, a non-US citizen continues to occupy the 250th position on the index on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A US-based billionaire, currently ranked slightly below 250th, sees their net worth increase due to favorable stock performance or other market factors. This pushes them up the rankings, displacing a non-US national and landing them in the 250th spot on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary factors: the most recent data point (the status quo) and the overall composition of the billionaire index. The status quo as of April 30, 2025, was 'No,' as the 250th person was Italian. Over a short timeframe of just one month, the status quo is a powerful predictor, as major shifts in wealth distribution are uncommon. This pulls the probability towards 'No'. However, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is heavily populated by US citizens. It is highly probable that many US billionaires are ranked in the vicinity of the 250th spot (e.g., 240-260). The daily volatility of the market means that the exact ranking on any given day has a significant element of randomness. A small outperformance of a US-based company's stock or a favorable currency shift could easily move a US citizen into the 250th position. My probability of 40% reflects a balance between the strong anchor of the recent status quo ('No') and the high base rate of US citizens on the list, which suggests a non-trivial chance of a 'Yes' outcome due to normal market fluctuations. My forecast is not higher because the only direct evidence points to a 'No' outcome. It is not lower because ignoring the high density of US billionaires around this rank and the daily volatility would be a mistake. I would increase my probability if I saw data suggesting US markets were significantly outperforming global markets in June 2025. Conversely, I would decrease it if a non-US billionaire appeared to solidify their position at or near the 250th rank.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
