    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize structural factors I underweighted: multi‑member FPTP tends to produce sweeps for whichever party leads in a ward; fragmented opposition often leaves Conservatives as the single largest group even when they lose control; and the rural/suburban bias of Daventry and South Northants remains a significant ballast. They also note Reform UK potentially splitting the right and the lingering county‑collapse baggage—both clear negatives for the Conservatives. New to me were (a) the explicit sweep mechanics under multi‑member FPTP, (b) the comparative pattern that Conservatives often remain largest in mixed urban–rural unitaries even in bad cycles, and (c) the reminder that a tie resolves as No. I find their structural argument persuasive, but I think 58–60% may be a bit high given Northampton likely holds a large share of seats and Labour probably dominates there, combined with Reform’s potential to chip away at rural Conservative sweeps. Net: I move upward, but only to about even.",
    "rationale": "Reassessing the seat math: Conservatives start from a very high 2021 base and retain strong rural advantages that multi‑member FPTP can amplify into sweeps. Opposition fragmentation across Labour/LD/Green/Ind in rural and edge wards further raises the bar for dislodging them as the largest group. On the other hand, Northampton town likely comprises a large share of seats; Labour’s 2024 general election strength there suggests they can secure many multi‑member wards, potentially yielding a large block of seats. Reform UK, if it fields a decent slate, risks eroding Conservative vote shares in rural wards and turning sweeps into splits or losses. With no evidence of boundary changes, pacts, candidate coverage, or local polling to decisively tilt the balance, I now weight the structural rural advantage and FPTP sweep effects more than I initially did, but offset them with the national headwinds, potential right‑split, and likely Labour dominance in the town. That leaves me near a coin flip rather than clearly favoring either side. I’m updating from 40% to 50% to reflect these structural advantages highlighted by the other forecasters while maintaining caution given the urban seat weight and national environment.",
