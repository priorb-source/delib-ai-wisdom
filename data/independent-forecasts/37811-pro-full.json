  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website Climate.gov remains online and accessible, as it is currently.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following actions consistent with 'Project 2025' and the recent decommissioning of other climate databases, the Trump administration issues a directive to take down Climate.gov. Alternatively, due to severe staff and budget cuts, the site experiences a technical failure and there are insufficient resources to bring it back online before the resolution check.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the administration's broader policy on climate information and budget cuts at NOAA, the agency follows through on its April 4, 2025, spokesperson's pledge that its research websites will remain online. Bureaucratic inertia and the short timeframe prevent a deliberate takedown before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the 'Yes' outcome, primarily due to the status quo and a key piece of direct evidence. Government websites have significant operational inertia, and Climate.gov is a major, established portal. More importantly, a NOAA spokesperson gave an explicit public assurance on April 4, 2025, that 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online' and that there would be 'no interruption in service.' This statement directly addresses the core of the question.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher than 90% due to the considerable political risk outlined in the background information. The Trump administration has demonstrated a willingness to remove climate-related resources, evidenced by the decommissioning of the 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database and significant staff cuts at NOAA. These actions align with the 'Project 2025' plan, which advocates for dismantling the agency. There is a non-trivial chance that an executive order or other high-level directive could override the spokesperson's statement, or that a technical failure caused by understaffing could take the site offline around the resolution date.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the official statement from NOAA provides a strong, specific counter-signal to the broader political trends. Taking down a high-profile public website is also a more visible and potentially more controversial act than archiving a specialized database or cutting internal staff. The short time remaining until the July 1 resolution date makes the implementation of such a decision less likely.\n\nI would lower my forecast if a credible internal memo were to leak or an official announcement were made indicating a plan to decommission Climate.gov. I would raise my forecast if the July 1 deadline grew closer without any such negative indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
