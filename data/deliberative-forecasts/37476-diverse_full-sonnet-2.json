    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core factors I identified, but Forecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling argument about base rates and the importance of acute triggers for bankruptcy filings within such a short timeframe. Forecaster 3's point that companies with cash exceeding debt rarely file for bankruptcy within 7 weeks absent an imminent maturity, covenant breach, or other forcing event is well-taken. The emphasis on how companies typically exhaust alternatives (cost-cutting, refinancing, asset sales) before filing is also persuasive. However, I find Forecaster 3's 3% forecast potentially too low given the genuine financial distress indicators - the current ratio of 0.5, massive losses, and the fact that the market cap of $90M versus $283M cash suggests sophisticated investors perceive significant value destruction risk. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning and arrives at 8%, which now seems slightly too high when weighted against base rates. The May 12 earnings report remains an important near-term information event that could reveal deterioration worse than currently known.",
    "rationale": "After considering the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward from 8% to 5%. Forecaster 3's emphasis on base rates and the need for acute triggers is compelling - companies with $283M cash, net cash positive positions, and no debt maturity until November rarely file for bankruptcy within a 7-week window. The absence of known covenant breaches, acceleration notices, or going-concern warnings supports a lower probability. However, I'm not going as low as 3% because several genuine risk factors warrant caution: (1) the current ratio of 0.5 indicates serious liquidity mismatch that could manifest in unexpected ways, (2) the May 12 earnings report could reveal cash burn or other issues worse than anticipated, (3) the stark disconnect between market cap ($90M) and cash ($283M) suggests informed market participants see material risk of value destruction, and (4) we lack perfect information about all liabilities and contingencies. A 5% forecast appropriately weights the low base rate of near-term bankruptcy against the non-trivial tail risk given the company's distressed financial condition.",
