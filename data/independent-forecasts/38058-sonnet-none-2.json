    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days until June 30, 2025. We are currently within the resolution window (May 20 - June 30, 2025), with about 35 days remaining for the condition to be satisfied.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Tariffs continue appearing on at least one of the two newspapers' front pages every day through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant story throughout the period due to ongoing Trump administration trade policy actions, economic impacts, international responses, or escalating trade tensions. Both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal continue to feature tariff-related stories prominently on their front pages every single day, ensuring the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on at least one paper daily.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, significant political development) dominates coverage on a particular day, or there's a temporary lull in tariff news where both papers coincidentally focus on other stories. On at least one day, both papers' front pages feature other business, economic, or general news stories without using the specific word 'tariff' or 'tariffs', even if trade policy remains a background topic.",
    "rationale": "The question background establishes that tariffs are currently a highly prominent topic in U.S. news media, driven by President Trump's active trade policy. We're already one week into the resolution window (May 26, with the window running May 20 - June 30), and the fact that we haven't heard of a YES resolution suggests tariffs remain on front pages.\n\nHowever, the resolution criteria create a specific circumstance: the question only requires ONE day where BOTH papers avoid using the specific word 'tariff(s)' - not that the topic disappears entirely. This is important because:\n\n1. **Favorable odds structure**: With ~35 days remaining, only one day needs to satisfy the condition\n2. **Word-specific criterion**: Headlines could reference 'trade policy', 'import taxes', 'Trump's economic agenda' without using the exact word 'tariff'\n3. **Dual requirement**: Both papers must avoid the word simultaneously, but newspapers sometimes have different editorial priorities on slow news days\n4. **Breaking news potential**: Major unexpected events could dominate front pages, pushing economic policy stories to inside pages\n\nWorking against YES:\n1. **Strong status quo**: The question setup emphasizes tariffs as ubiquitous in current coverage\n2. **Economic focus**: Both NYT and WSJ heavily cover business/economic news where tariffs are central\n3. **Ongoing policy**: Active trade policy generates continuous news rather than one-time stories\n4. **Already in window**: We're past May 19 without apparent resolution, suggesting persistent coverage\n\nMy forecast weighs the strong status quo (continuous tariff coverage) against the relatively low bar (just one day in 35) and word-specific nature of the criterion. The forecast is not higher because tariffs appear to be the dominant economic story. It's not lower because 35 days provides meaningful opportunity for competing news cycles, and the word-specific requirement creates edge cases where the topic might be referenced differently.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
