    "review": "Both forecasters raised important points I had underweighted. Forecaster 3's endorsement details are particularly significant - having both former Governors McAuliffe and Northam plus Rep. Bobby Scott represents strong establishment consolidation that goes beyond just fundraising advantages. This actually strengthens Jones's position. However, Forecaster 2 makes excellent points about uncertainty factors: the lack of public polling, Taylor's prosecutorial credibility and law enforcement endorsements, and especially the concurrent gubernatorial primary's unpredictable effect on turnout composition. Forecaster 2's historical data point that Jones got 'low-40s' in 2021 is useful context - it suggests he's competitive but not dominant. The fact that two independent forecasters converged on 58-62% suggests my 72% may reflect overconfidence. Taylor's Henrico Commonwealth's Attorney position and electability argument against Miyares are stronger assets than I initially weighted, particularly in suburban NOVA/Richmond areas that typically have high primary turnout.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward but not as low as the other forecasters. The endorsement information (both former governors, Rep. Scott) combined with sustained 2-to-1 fundraising advantage and prior statewide infrastructure makes Jones clearly the favorite in fundamental terms. However, I had underweighted several uncertainty factors: (1) Complete absence of public polling means we're inferring from fundamentals without voter preference confirmation; (2) Taylor's prosecutorial background and law enforcement endorsements provide a credible 'electability' narrative; (3) The concurrent gubernatorial primary adds compositional uncertainty to turnout; (4) With only two weeks left, late-breaking dynamics could still emerge. My original 72% was too confident given these uncertainties. But dropping to 58% would understate Jones's structural advantages. The establishment consolidation around Jones (governors, fundraising, infrastructure) in a two-person race typically translates to victory absent major disruptions. I'm settling at 66% - acknowledging meaningful uncertainty while maintaining Jones as the clear favorite.",
