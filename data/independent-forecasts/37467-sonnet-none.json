    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 54 days until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Beyond Meat continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat manages its liquidity through some combination of cost-cutting measures, securing additional financing, restructuring debt obligations, or selling non-core assets. The company continues operations through July 1, 2025 without needing bankruptcy protection despite ongoing losses.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat's cash position deteriorates rapidly due to continuing operational losses, inability to access credit markets, and/or covenant violations on existing debt. Creditors demand repayment, the company cannot meet obligations, and management files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025 to reorganize.",
    "rationale": "The short timeframe of 54 days is crucial here. While Beyond Meat is clearly in financial distress with $38M in Q4 2024 operating losses, bankruptcy is typically a last resort that requires either immediate insolvency or exhaustion of alternatives. Several factors suggest low probability: (1) The company just reported quarterly results, indicating ongoing operations and likely some remaining cash runway, (2) Companies in distress typically signal bankruptcy weeks or months in advance through missed payments, going concern warnings, or emergency financing attempts, (3) Even struggling companies usually attempt restructuring, asset sales, or emergency capital raises before bankruptcy. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) We lack detailed information about their current cash position and debt covenants, (2) The significant losses suggest burning cash rapidly, (3) Consumer discretionary companies can face sudden liquidity crises. My forecast would increase significantly with news of covenant violations, inability to make payroll, auditor warnings, or failed financing attempts. It would decrease with announcements of successful capital raises, major cost reductions, or improved sales trends. The status quo heavily favors 'No' given the short timeframe and absence of immediate bankruptcy signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
