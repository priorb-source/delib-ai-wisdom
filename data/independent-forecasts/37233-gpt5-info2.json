  "information": "President Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (he has not personally declared yet)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara withholds a personal declaration until later in the summer (e.g., after a June/July party conclave or closer to August, following 2020 timing), or ultimately opts to back a successor, leaving May without a formal declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP convenes an extraordinary congress or political council in May where Ouattara formally accepts the nomination, or he declares in a televised address/interview or major rally before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Signals point toward Ouattara being the RHDP’s preferred nominee, but timing is the key. The research assistant notes: (1) RHDP has called him its “natural candidate” since 2024; (2) in late Dec 2024 Minister Anne Désirée Ouloto said he would be the candidate; (3) in early Jan 2025 Minister Amadou Koné said he will be the October 2025 candidate; and (4) a late-April 2025 youth group publicly urged him to run. These are strong elite cues but do not yet meet the resolution criterion that he himself declare before June 1. Historically, Ouattara declared relatively close to the election (e.g., 2020 declaration in early August for an October vote), and incumbents sometimes delay formal entry to preserve leverage over internal negotiations and coalition-building. With roughly one month left, the status quo (no personal declaration) slightly dominates absent evidence of a scheduled May RHDP congress or set-piece announcement. Reasons the probability is not higher: no personal on-the-record declaration so far; no widely reported date for a May party congress/nomination; past precedent of later declarations. Reasons it is not lower: he is eligible under the 2016 constitutional framework; senior ministers repeatedly assert he will be the candidate; party discipline and incumbency advantages make an eventual run plausible; declaring in May would consolidate the party and shape the field. What would move me up: credible reports of an RHDP extraordinary congress or national council meeting scheduled in May with a candidate nomination on the agenda; announcements of a presidential address or large rally billed as a “major declaration.” What would move me down: continued silence into mid-May; leaks about RHDP vetting alternate standard-bearers; signs of health or intra-party issues prompting delay or reconsideration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
