    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar reasoning, identifying the same key factors: the Rwanda proof-of-concept, NUFORC's US-centric nature, the restrictive pilot requirement, and the narrow one-month window. The main difference lies in our numerical estimates (18%, 20%, 25%). Forecaster 3 provides the most valuable new insight by attempting to establish a concrete base rate, estimating 2-6 African pilot reports per year to NUFORC, which yields 15-40% probability per month under reasonable distributional assumptions. This explicit base rate reasoning is more rigorous than my initial approach. Using Poisson distribution logic: if λ = 2-6 reports/year, then λ/month = 0.17-0.5, giving P(at least 1) = 1 - e^(-λ) ≈ 16-39%. However, I'm skeptical of the upper bound - the lower end (2-3 reports/year) seems more plausible given NUFORC's limited African penetration and the fact we have only one confirmed recent example. The forecasters correctly note that we all lack sufficient historical data, making this largely an informed guess.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 18% was slightly too conservative. Forecaster 3's base rate framework is sound: if African pilot reports occur 2-6 times per year on NUFORC, basic probability math suggests 16-39% for any given month. While we lack definitive historical data, the Rwanda January 2025 example at least confirms these reports occur with some regularity. However, I lean toward the lower end of the estimated frequency range (2-3 reports/year rather than 6) because: (1) NUFORC has limited brand recognition in Africa, (2) pilots may use local or regional reporting systems instead, (3) the single data point suggests rarity rather than abundance. With λ ≈ 2.5 reports/year = 0.21/month, P(at least 1 in June) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.21) ≈ 19%. The convergence of all three forecasters in the 18-25% range provides additional confidence that this is the reasonable range. I'm updating from 18% to 21%, acknowledging the value of the base rate reasoning while maintaining some conservatism about report frequency.",
