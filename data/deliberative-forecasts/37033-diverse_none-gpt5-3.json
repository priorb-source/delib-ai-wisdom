    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the timing and base-rate concerns. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the five-year gap before the first payment is a strong prior against quick follow-ups and I hadn’t foregrounded that as heavily. Forecaster 2’s point that two payments within ~7 weeks would be unusually fast for Zimbabwe’s fiscal/administrative machinery is also persuasive. I agree the first tranche may have been a one-off signal tied to spring meetings and broader arrears diplomacy. I think they somewhat underweight a potential reputational incentive to show momentum ahead of late-May international events (e.g., AfDB meetings), but their arguments justify shifting downward from my initial take.",
    "rationale": "Key updates to my view: (1) Heavier weight on the base rate that payments have been extremely infrequent; the inaugural payment after ~5 years suggests low cadence absent explicit scheduling. (2) The short window (39 days from Apr 23 to Jun 1) combined with Zimbabwe’s fiscal and administrative frictions makes a second payment before June 1 less likely without prior earmarking. (3) Upside remains from signaling incentives tied to arrears clearance and the possibility of a small symbolic follow-up around late May, but there’s no evidence of a set tranche schedule or ringfenced financing.\nNet effect: I lower my probability, but not to very low levels, because the pathway exists and a modest, publicity-friendly disbursement remains plausible. I would raise the forecast on any credible report of scheduled tranches or an official commitment to another payment by end-May; I would lower it on signs of acute FX strain or statements that the April payment exhausts near-term plans.",
