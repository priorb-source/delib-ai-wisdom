  "information": "A survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60% at Morning Consult; if those levels persisted, Milei would be higher)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Milei’s approval softens into the mid- to low-50s (or below) as austerity pain dominates perceptions, while Sheinbaum holds near ~60% or inches up; or they tie. Since ties resolve as No, any tie or Sheinbaum lead yields No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei’s approval stabilizes or rebounds to ~60–62% on improving inflation headlines and a legislative or policy win, while Sheinbaum dips to ~57–59% due to a negative security/economy news cycle or early-term missteps, leaving Milei narrowly ahead when Metaculus checks.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The tracker currently shows a razor-thin Milei lead (61 vs 60). If nothing moved, the answer would be Yes. However, small shifts decide this, and a tie is a No by rule. Trends and corroborating data point mildly against Milei holding the edge into late June. \n\nEvidence and reasoning:\n- Argentine sentiment appears to be softening. The assistant-cited late-April D’Alessio IROL/Berensztein survey shows Milei’s positive image at 44% and negatives at 52% (net -8). While not the same instrument as Morning Consult, it signals wear consistent with austerity fatigue and mixed evaluations of government performance. This suggests downside risk to Milei’s MC approval over the next 1–2 months.\n- Sheinbaum is still in an early-term period where Mexican presidents often sustain relatively high approvals. Morning Consult historically shows Mexico’s presidents with elevated, sticky approval levels; a figure around 60% for Sheinbaum is plausible and could be resilient absent a shock.\n- Measurement and resolution mechanics: Morning Consult’s tracker moves gradually; a 1-point edge is well within normal week-to-week noise. Because ties resolve as No, even a true toss-up leans against a Yes outcome.\n- Time horizon: ~45 days. That’s enough time for a few-point drift but not for a wholesale reversal absent salient events. Given Milei’s likely headwinds and Sheinbaum’s stability, the median path has Sheinbaum ≥ Milei by the check date.\n\nWhy not higher than my forecast: The margin is only 1 point, tie counts as No, and Argentine polling (assistant-cited) indicates slippage for Milei. These factors make a sustained Milei edge less likely.\nWhy not lower: Argentina’s inflation deceleration and any visible policy wins could buoy Milei’s standing quickly. Morning Consult has previously shown him near 60; a short-term uptick is plausible, and Sheinbaum could face a negative news cycle.\n\nWhat would move me up: (a) Morning Consult updates showing Milei holding ≥60 for consecutive waves; (b) clear positive economic headlines in Argentina (inflation, reserves, legislative victories) along with stable social order; (c) a downtick for Sheinbaum into the high-50s tied to security/economic shocks.\nWhat would move me down: (a) MC prints with Milei sliding into the low-/mid-50s; (b) renewed protests or market stress in Argentina; (c) Sheinbaum holding 60–62% with calm newsflow.\n\nNetting these, I put extra weight on the current 1-point lead but discount it due to trend risks and the tie-as-No rule.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
