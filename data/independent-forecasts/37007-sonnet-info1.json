  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7-9 days. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, with results likely known within 1-2 days of voting.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be the People's National Movement (PNM) winning the most seats, as they are the incumbent party and won the 2020 election with 21 out of 41 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United National Congress (UNC) successfully flips at least 2 seats from the PNM in key constituencies, winning 21 or more seats while the PNM falls to 20 or fewer. This could occur through successful campaigning in marginal districts, mobilization of opposition voters, or dissatisfaction with the incumbent government.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM maintains or improves upon its narrow majority by holding its 21 seats or gaining additional seats. The incumbency advantage, government resources, and historical electoral strength allow the PNM to secure a plurality despite a competitive race.",
    "rationale": "With only 7 days until the election, we are at a point where most campaigning is complete and voter intentions are largely set. The key factors informing my forecast are: (1) Incumbency advantage - the PNM is the sitting government, which typically provides structural advantages in resources, visibility, and continuity; (2) Historical pattern - the PNM has won the majority of elections since 2000, suggesting institutional strength; (3) The extremely close 2020 result (21-19) indicates high competitiveness and volatility. Without recent polling data from my research assistant, I must weight these factors carefully. The narrow 2-seat margin from 2020 means that flipping just 2 constituencies could change the outcome. However, given the proximity to election day, major swings are less likely unless there are late-breaking developments. I'm not forecasting higher (e.g., 75-80%) because the 2020 margin was razor-thin and Trinidad and Tobago has shown it can swing between parties. I'm not forecasting lower (e.g., 50%) because incumbency effects are real and the PNM's historical record suggests organizational strength. To update higher, I would need evidence of: strong recent polling favoring PNM, successful government performance, or weak opposition campaigning. To update lower, I would need: credible polling showing UNC leads, major government scandals, or evidence of strong anti-incumbent sentiment. My forecast of 62% reflects a modest but meaningful advantage for the incumbent PNM while acknowledging significant uncertainty in what remains a competitive two-party race.",
