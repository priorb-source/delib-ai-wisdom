    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Beto O'Rourke has not announced a candidacy for the US Senate and is a private citizen. If nothing changes by the deadline, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues his political activism and keeps his options open for a future run, but decides the timing is not right to launch a campaign for a 2026 election this early. He makes no formal announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an attempt to get an early start on fundraising, consolidate support, and define the race on his own terms, Beto O'Rourke formally announces his candidacy for the US Senate in Texas in a press conference or video release during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong status quo and the lack of a compelling reason for an announcement within the short, specified timeframe. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is very close. While Beto O'Rourke is a perennial candidate who has publicly stated he would run 'if' asked, this is standard political positioning to maintain relevance and gauge support, not an indication of an imminent announcement. The next Senate election in Texas isn't until November 2026. Launching a campaign more than 16 months out, especially within the next 40 days, offers few strategic advantages and opens him up to a prolonged period of political attack. It is far more likely he would wait until late 2025 or early 2026 to announce, if he decides to run at all, after a period of consideration and strategic planning. His history of recent electoral losses (President in 2020, Governor in 2022) may also counsel a more cautious and deliberate approach rather than a hasty, early launch. My probability is not lower than 10% because O'Rourke is a high-profile figure who could defy conventional timelines to energize his base and capture early media attention. His statement in the provided article confirms he is actively considering a run. My probability is not higher because there are no signs of an impending campaign launch, such as hiring key staff or a significant uptick in fundraising, and a very early announcement is strategically suboptimal. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of him staffing up for a Senate run or planning a major announcement. I would decrease it if he took on another long-term commitment or if the deadline gets closer without any activity.",
