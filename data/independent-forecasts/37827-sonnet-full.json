  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. June 2025 begins in 9 days (on June 1, 2025), runs for 30 days, and the question resolves when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on historical patterns, a pilot report from Africa in any given month is unlikely to occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any pilots reporting UFO sightings from African countries to NUFORC, or pilots observe phenomena but don't report them, or reports are submitted too late to appear in the database when checked on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot flying in or over an African country (such as South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, or another nation) observes and reports a UFO/UAP sighting to NUFORC during June 2025, and the report is published in the database before the resolution check.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate strongly suggests a 'No' outcome. With only 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024), this translates to approximately 0.4-0.6 reports per year, or roughly 0.04-0.05 per month assuming even distribution. This yields a baseline probability of approximately 4-5% for any given month.\n\nSeveral factors inform this estimate: First, the January 1, 2025 Rwanda pilot report demonstrates that such reports do occur and that 2025 has already seen African pilot activity in the NUFORC database. This is noteworthy, as it represents one of potentially only 4-6 such reports expected over a decade. However, this single data point is insufficient to conclude that 2025 represents a systematic increase in reporting frequency.\n\nSecond, pilot reports constitute only about 1% of NUFORC's 5,000-6,000 annual reports globally (50-60 pilot reports per year), and Africa represents less than 1% of these pilot reports based on the historical data. This reflects both lower air traffic density in Africa relative to North America and Europe, and potentially less robust reporting infrastructure.\n\nThird, the specificity of the question—requiring a pilot report (not just any report), from Africa (a continent with relatively sparse coverage), in June specifically (one particular month)—compounds the low probability.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: The base rate remains very low, the January report could easily be a statistical anomaly rather than indicating a trend, and Africa's air traffic and reporting patterns haven't fundamentally changed.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: The probability is not zero—we have clear evidence such reports do occur, we've already seen one in 2025, and 5% appropriately reflects a rare but plausible event.\n\nI would update higher if: Additional pilot reports emerge from Africa in May, evidence suggests increased UAP activity globally in June, or increased air traffic/reporting infrastructure in Africa becomes apparent.\n\nI would update lower if: Analysis shows the January report was exceptionally unusual, or if May passes with no African reports of any kind, reinforcing the rarity of these events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
