    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core mechanics I relied on: (1) short remaining window, (2) need for a formal 8-K termination to resolve Yes, and (3) the primary kill paths being either a CFIUS/Presidential block or an imminent outside date without extension. They add no fresh factual catalysts (e.g., specific outside date disclosures, credible CFIUS leaks), but they correctly stress inertia and the tendency to extend rather than terminate if approval remains plausible. I agree with their trigger lists for moving up or down. The main uncertainty they highlight—whether an outside date lands near end‑June—remains unverified here. Net, their reasoning is consistent with mine and does not materially shift my view.",
    "rationale": "The deal faces real political/CFIUS headwinds, but to resolve Yes we need a formal 8‑K termination before July 1. With ~46 days left, absent a confirmed late‑June outside date or a clear, scheduled block, the base case is continued review or extension. Both parties have strong incentives to preserve option value rather than abandon preemptively, and outright presidential prohibitions are uncommon, especially with a close ally acquirer; mitigation or timeline extensions are more typical. Because I see no new evidence of an imminent regulatory denial or a hard drop‑dead date, I keep a modest tail for a sudden block or a non‑extension but overweight inertia. I therefore maintain my prior estimate.",
