    "review": "The other forecasters have provided critical insights that fundamentally challenge my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's argument is the most impactful: they correctly point out that my primary assumption—that Kalshi is already offering daily single-game MLB markets—is almost certainly false. As a CFTC-regulated exchange, Kalshi is constrained from offering markets that could be deemed 'gaming,' and the CFTC has historically taken a prohibitive stance on single-game sports outcomes. This single point transforms the question from 'Will an existing service continue?' to 'Will a new, legally contentious service launch immediately and run perfectly?' Forecaster 2 adds another powerful and independent argument against a 'Yes' outcome that I had completely overlooked: the external constraint of the MLB schedule. They correctly note that even a single league-wide off-day in June would make a 'Yes' resolution impossible. The combination of these two arguments is overwhelmingly convincing and exposes my initial forecast as poorly premised.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically updating my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial 70% forecast was based on the flawed assumption that Kalshi currently offers daily single-game baseball markets and that the main risk was an interruption to the status quo. Forecaster 3's analysis has corrected my understanding of the regulatory environment; the CFTC has not approved such markets, meaning the status quo is that they do not exist. Therefore, for this question to resolve 'Yes,' Kalshi would need to receive unprecedented regulatory approval (or win a major legal victory that expands their mandate beyond political markets) and then immediately launch a brand new market category on June 1st.\n\nFurthermore, Forecaster 2 introduced a critical, independent factor: the MLB schedule. It is highly probable that there is at least one day in June 2025 with no scheduled MLB games. A quick check of historical MLB schedules shows that league-wide off-days in June are common. A single such day guarantees a 'No' resolution, regardless of Kalshi's regulatory status or operational capabilities.\n\nThese two factors combined—the high regulatory barrier to entry and the likely existence of a 'no-game' day—make a 'Yes' outcome extraordinarily improbable. It would require a sudden, favorable regulatory shift, immediate perfect operational execution, and an anomalously non-stop MLB schedule. The likelihood of all these conditions being met is negligible. I am therefore revising my forecast from 70% down to 5%, aligning with the reasoning provided by Forecaster 3.",
