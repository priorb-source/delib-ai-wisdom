    "rationale": "- Status quo: As of May 28, DHS has revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification. If nothing changes, this resolves No.\n- Why change is plausible by July 1:\n  • Legal posture: Using SEVP to punish campus climate or alleged political failings appears far afield from the program’s statutory/regulatory remit (which centers on institutional compliance, recordkeeping, accreditation, etc.). That raises strong Administrative Procedure Act and First Amendment concerns. Courts often grant emergency relief when agency action looks ultra vires and imposes large, immediate harms.\n  • Irreparable harm: Roughly a quarter of the student body is affected. Visa status and transfer risks create classic irreparable harm factors; this strengthens the case for a TRO/preliminary injunction.\n  • Timing feasibility: TROs can be issued within days to a couple of weeks; preliminary injunctions can follow within weeks. We have about a month, which is enough for emergency relief. Even absent a court order, DHS could issue an administrative stay pending review.\n  • Precedent signals: In 2020, courts moved quickly against abrupt DHS/ICE actions affecting international students. While circumstances differ, they illustrate courts’ willingness to intervene rapidly where agency actions imperil students’ status en masse.\n- Why not higher: \n  • National security/public safety framing by DHS could draw judicial deference, especially if the government asserts classified evidence; some judges may hesitate to compel affirmative reinstatement quickly.\n  • Appellate risk: Even if a district court grants a TRO, the government could seek a stay from the circuit/Supreme Court. A stayed injunction would mean no certification by July 1.\n  • Procedural lag: Even with favorable rulings, implementation (SEVIS updates, formal notices) could slip past July 1.\n- Why not lower:\n  • The government’s stated rationale (campus climate/discipline, alleged foreign influence) is likely mismatched to SEVP’s statutory purpose, making the action vulnerable on APA grounds.\n  • The scale and immediacy of harm to students and research partners increase the odds of expedited relief.\n  • Multiple off-ramps exist (court-ordered reinstatement, administrative stay, negotiated conditional reinstatement) that would all satisfy the resolution criteria if effective by July 1.\n- What would move me up:\n  • Evidence Harvard has filed for emergency relief with a prompt hearing date; strong judicial signals at a hearing; amici support; reports of DHS considering or granting an administrative stay.\n  • Reporting that DHS failed to follow required procedures (e.g., notice, opportunity to respond) or that the record for revocation is unusually thin.\n- What would move me down:\n  • A court denying TRO or setting a distant hearing date; government indicating classified, specific national security grounds; an appellate stay of any district-court relief; signs Harvard is pursuing a slower administrative appeal without emergency relief.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the prompt; forecast based on general legal/process dynamics, timing, and incentives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
