    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not return to U.S. territory by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He remains abroad under an active removal order and related inadmissibility bars. Any court challenges, congressional interventions, or DHS waiver/parole requests (e.g., I-212 consent to reapply, humanitarian parole) remain unresolved past July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sustained public attention and legal advocacy prompt DHS to grant humanitarian parole or consent to reapply, or a court order facilitates his return; credible media or official sources report that he arrives at a U.S. port of entry or otherwise enters U.S. territory before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Base rates dominate: individuals who have been deported face multi‑year inadmissibility bars (often 5–10 years) and typically require DHS consent (I‑212) and/or humanitarian parole to re-enter. Those processes commonly take months to years, not weeks. With only about two months left, the status quo strongly favors no return by the deadline. The existence of a dedicated Wikipedia page suggests some public attention, which marginally increases the chance of rapid discretionary relief compared to a typical case, but fast-track readmissions remain rare absent clear government error or sustained high-profile pressure. I received no additional information from the research assistant, so I have no signals of active litigation, congressional involvement, or DHS review that would elevate the short-term re-entry probability. Why not higher: legal and procedural hurdles, short time window, and the rarity of expedited reversals or parole-based returns. Why not lower: limited but nonzero chance of humanitarian parole or a court order in a high-visibility case; if credible reporting emerges confirming DHS review, congressional letters, or a filed/expedited I‑212/parole request, I would move upward. Downward updates would follow if there is confirmation of a 10-year bar with no pending relief, statements from DHS indicating no review, or simply the passage of time without any movement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
