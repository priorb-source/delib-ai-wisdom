  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.\n\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks, from May 12, 2025 to June 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India continues to decline or ignore Bangladesh's extradition request, and Sheikh Hasina remains in India where she has been granted refuge since August 2024. She does not voluntarily return given the serious criminal charges awaiting her, including allegations of crimes against humanity from the July 2024 uprising.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either India unexpectedly agrees to extradite Sheikh Hasina in response to sustained diplomatic pressure from Bangladesh, or Sheikh Hasina makes a surprise decision to voluntarily return to Bangladesh to galvanize her political base and challenge the charges against her, possibly emboldened by Khaleda Zia's successful return on May 6, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors a No outcome. Sheikh Hasina has been in Indian exile for 9 months, and India has not responded to Bangladesh's December 2024 extradition request. India has historically maintained close ties with Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League, making forced extradition unlikely without significant geopolitical pressure. The 7-week timeframe is very short for major diplomatic shifts. Key factors against her return: (1) India's silence on extradition despite it being Bangladesh's 'top priority'; (2) She faces serious charges including crimes against humanity; (3) The interim government is hostile; (4) No concrete indicators of imminent change. Small factors potentially favoring return: (1) Her public vow to return; (2) Khaleda Zia's recent successful return might embolden her; (3) The May 15 contempt court deadline is imminent. However, a voluntary return seems irrational given the serious charges and certain arrest. An involuntary extradition would require India to reverse 9 months of asylum policy in just weeks. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of: India signaling willingness to extradite, concrete travel plans, or significant political developments forcing India's hand. For it to decrease further: explicit Indian statements supporting her continued stay or bilateral tensions with Bangladesh. Given the strong status quo bias and short timeframe, I estimate an 8% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
