  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days until July 1, 2025 (as of May 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The Diversity Visa program continues to operate normally without any presidential action mentioning it. None of the 40+ presidential actions issued since January 2025 have contained the phrase 'Diversity Visa.'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues prioritizing immigration issues that can be more directly controlled through executive action (border security, illegal immigration enforcement). While Congressional legislation like the SAFE for America Act proceeds, the administration does not issue a presidential action specifically mentioning the Diversity Visa program before July 1, recognizing that the program is statutorily established and would require Congressional action to eliminate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or presidential memorandum attempting to suspend or modify the Diversity Visa program, potentially triggered by a security incident, political pressure from conservative supporters, or to signal support for pending Congressional legislation. The action specifically uses the phrase 'Diversity Visa' and appears on the White House presidential actions page before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. Trump has been in office for approximately 4 months and has issued 62 executive orders focused on immigration, yet none have mentioned the Diversity Visa program despite his 2017 statements calling for its termination. The program continues operating normally with scheduled lottery releases. The key constraint is that the Diversity Visa program is established by statute, meaning substantive changes require Congressional legislation rather than executive action. Trump's legal team likely understands that any executive attempt to eliminate or substantially alter the program would face immediate legal challenges and likely be struck down, similar to other immigration actions that exceeded executive authority. His administration has focused on immigration areas where executive authority is clearer: border emergencies, enforcement priorities, and regulatory changes. The pending SAFE for America Act suggests the preferred path is legislative. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) Trump has shown willingness to test executive authority limits with actions like the birthright citizenship order, (2) he could issue a memorandum directing agencies to implement restrictions within existing statutory frameworks while mentioning the program, (3) 42 days provides sufficient time, and (4) a security incident could trigger rapid action. The specific requirement to use the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' also matters - Trump might take actions affecting the program without using that precise terminology. I would update higher if: there's a security incident linked to the program, reports emerge of imminent executive action, or clear coordination with Congressional efforts. I would update lower as each day passes without action, or if reporting indicates focus on other priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
