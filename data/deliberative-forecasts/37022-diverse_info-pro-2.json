    "review": "The other forecasters fundamentally changed my understanding of the question. My initial analysis assumed the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold was being compared against Ukraine's total government debt, making a 'Yes' resolution a near-certainty. Forecaster 2 correctly identified the critical ambiguity: the Trading Economics source might be tracking a narrower subset of debt. Forecaster 3 provided a specific data point for February 2025 (1.869 trillion UAH) which confirmed this, reframing the problem from one of absolute scale to one of monthly financial flows. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning about source uncertainty very convincing. However, I found Forecaster 3's conclusion (43%) unconvincing because it relied on historical monthly averages while ignoring the specific (and quite large) debt-increasing financial flows for March 2025 detailed in the research assistant's report.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my rationale and lowering my forecast from 99% to 90%. My initial assessment was incorrect, as it presumed the question was about total state debt. The other forecasters have convinced me that the resolution hinges on a specific data series that was very close to the threshold at the end of February 2025 (1.869 trillion UAH). The question is therefore whether the debt increased by at least 31 billion UAH in March.\n\nThe research assistant's report gives us specific data for March: Ukraine received a 16 billion UAH IMF disbursement and raised 26 billion UAH from domestic bond auctions. These two inflows alone total 42 billion UAH, which is sufficient to push the debt figure past the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold (1.869T + 0.042T = 1.911T). This calculation does not even include other upward pressures like the expected €1 billion EU loan or the effect of hryvnia depreciation. While modest debt servicing costs would partially offset this, it is highly improbable they would be large enough to negate the increase entirely and keep the total below 1.90 trillion. My forecast is lowered from near-certainty to 90% to reflect the inherent, albeit small, risks in monthly data reporting, such as booking delays or unexpectedly high redemptions not mentioned in the report.",
