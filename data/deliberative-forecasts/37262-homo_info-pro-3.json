    "review": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling and it has prompted a significant update to my forecast. My initial analysis was aligned with Forecaster 2's, focusing on the recent violent protests as a key trigger, but my caution about the short timeframe and potential reporting lags kept my forecast at 60%. Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial points I had undervalued or was unaware of: 1) Specific, near-term triggers beyond the land law protests, most notably a planned farmers' march explicitly intended to reach the 10,000-participant threshold. This provides a separate, concrete pathway to a 'Yes' resolution. 2) A critical clarification of the resolution criteria, noting that the protest only needs to *start* before July 1, not be *recorded* by the tracker by that date. This single point removes my major uncertainty regarding reporting delays.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 60% to 80%. My initial forecast was based on the high potential for escalation from the recent violent land law protests but was restrained by the short two-month window and concerns about reporting lags. The deliberations, particularly with Forecaster 3, have convinced me that my initial assessment was too conservative. The introduction of new evidence—specifically a planned farmers' march that directly targets the 10,000-participant number—substantially increases the probability of a 'Yes' outcome by creating multiple independent scenarios for resolution. Furthermore, the clarification that the resolution is tied to the protest's start date, not its documentation date in the tracker, effectively neutralizes one of my primary reasons for assigning a lower probability. The combination of a strong existing trigger (land law unrest), a high base rate of large protests in India, and now a concrete planned event makes an 80% forecast more accurate. The remaining 20% uncertainty accounts for the possibility that planned protests are cancelled, postponed, or suppressed by authorities.",
