    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short runway, protectionist/regulatory posture, small-market prioritization by Uber, and the only realistic fast path being an Uber Taxi integration with licensed taxis. Forecaster 2 adds a useful corporate-strategy lens (Uber focusing more on product breadth than opening tiny new geographies), which further lowers near-term odds. Neither presents positive signals (government statements, recruitment, Uber listings) that would push the probability up. I find their reasoning coherent and consistent with regional precedents; it reinforces a low, but non-zero, probability path via a sanctioned taxi-partner model.",
    "rationale": "About two months remain to July 1. Status quo is No, with recent official warnings against illegal taxis signaling enforcement and protection of the licensed taxi sector. Launching would require at least one of: regulatory clearance, a government-endorsed Uber Taxi model, or a limited pilot; any of these would likely generate public signals (press, MoU, driver onboarding, Uber site/help pages) that are currently absent. TCI’s small market and Uber’s current prioritization reduce odds of rushing a bespoke launch. The only plausible quick path is a government-approved integration with licensed taxis targeted at tourists, which Uber can technically deploy fast once approved. Given no evidence of negotiations or policy shifts, that path remains unlikely within the short timeframe. I would move up materially on credible reports of a taxi-integration agreement, ministerial statements permitting ride-hail, Uber recruiting/driving guides for TCI, or Uber listing TCI. I would move down on explicit reaffirmations of prohibition or further enforcement notices. Net: the peers’ analyses strengthen my initial low estimate; I maintain a low single-digit probability and keep 7% as a balanced point reflecting a narrow but real ‘Uber Taxi’ path.",
