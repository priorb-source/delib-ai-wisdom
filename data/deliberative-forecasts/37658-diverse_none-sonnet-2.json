    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises several compelling points I underweighted. Most critically, they emphasize that Japan is a close ally, not an adversarial nation, which significantly changes CFIUS dynamics - mitigation agreements are far more common than outright blocks for allied-nation deals. They also correctly stress that 45 days is an extremely short window for a regulatory decision plus formal termination filing. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own at 45-48%, but neither of us adequately accounted for the ally-mitigation pathway. However, I think Forecaster 3's 22% may be slightly low given the exceptional 17-month duration of this review and the unusually direct political opposition from the President himself, which suggests this isn't a typical 'mitigation and approval' case.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating downward significantly. The key factors I initially underweighted: (1) Japan's ally status makes CFIUS more likely to pursue mitigation than outright block; (2) 45 days is genuinely very short for both a regulatory decision AND formal termination filing; (3) without knowing the merger agreement's outside date, there may be no contractual trigger forcing termination soon; (4) termination fees and corporate inertia favor extension over collapse. However, I'm not going as low as 22% because: (a) this deal has dragged for 17 months - exceptionally long, suggesting genuine impasse rather than routine review; (b) Biden's personal opposition is unusually direct for a sitting President; (c) if an outside date exists before July 1 without extension, termination becomes much more likely; (d) the length already suggests parties may be near exhaustion of extension options. Balancing these, I'm settling in the 30-35% range, acknowledging Forecaster 3's strong structural arguments while maintaining that the unusual political dynamics and extraordinary timeline create higher-than-baseline termination risk.",
