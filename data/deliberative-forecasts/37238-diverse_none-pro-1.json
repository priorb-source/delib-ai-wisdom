    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was far too high. The other two forecasters provided a crucial and compelling argument that I had failed to properly weigh: the base rate. My analysis was overly influenced by recency bias, treating the single recent attendance on April 13th as indicative of a near-certain pattern, rather than as one data point within a larger context. Forecasters 2 and 3 correctly pointed out that the UFC holds many pay-per-view events per year (~12-13), and Trump historically attends only a small fraction of them (1-3 per year). This base rate, suggesting a probability closer to 15-25% for any randomly selected event, is a much more robust starting point than my initial intuition. Their reasoning is highly convincing because it is grounded in historical data and guards against over-interpreting a single recent event. They correctly identified that without knowing the date, location, or significance of UFC 316, it must be treated as a typical event, for which the status quo is non-attendance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am making a significant downward revision to my forecast. My initial 75% forecast was flawed due to recency bias, where I overweighted the importance of Trump's recent attendance at a UFC event in April 2025. The other forecasters correctly anchored their analysis on the historical base rate, which is a much more reliable method given the lack of specific information about UFC 316.\n\nThe core of my revised reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Base Rate:** The UFC holds approximately 12-13 numbered pay-per-view events annually. Historically, Donald Trump has attended 1 to 3 of these events per year. This establishes a baseline probability of attendance for any given event in the range of 8% to 25%.\n2.  **Current Information:** The question provides no specific details about UFC 316's date or location. Therefore, it should be treated as a representative, randomly-selected event, making the base rate the most powerful predictor.\n3.  **Positive Indicators:** While the base rate is low, factors such as Trump's close relationship with Dana White and his very recent attendance as President do suggest he is an engaged fan, justifying a forecast at the higher end of the base-rate range. His recent attendance confirms that presidential duties do not preclude such appearances.\n\nI am moving my forecast from 75% down to 25%. This new forecast aligns with the strong, data-driven arguments presented by the other experts. It correctly positions non-attendance as the default outcome while acknowledging that the specific positive factors (his enthusiasm and recent behavior) elevate the probability above a simple low-end base rate.",
