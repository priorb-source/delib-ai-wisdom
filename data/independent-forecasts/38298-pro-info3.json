  "information": "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The official NOAA report for May 2025 is typically released in the middle of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The global temperature anomaly for May 2025, while extremely high compared to the 20th-century average, falls just below the record set in May 2024. This is due to the transition from a powerful El Niño event in 2024 to ENSO-neutral or La Niña conditions, which has a temporary global cooling effect that outweighs the year-over-year background warming.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The underlying long-term warming trend, driven by record greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated ocean heat, proves to be overwhelmingly strong. It overcomes the cooling influence of the fading El Niño, pushing the global average temperature for May 2025 past the record set in the previous year.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the interplay between the long-term global warming trend and the short-term variability of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The current record for the hottest May was almost certainly set in May 2024, during the peak of a strong El Niño event which adds significant warmth to the global system. By May 2025, climate models widely predict that the Pacific Ocean will have transitioned to ENSO-neutral or even La Niña conditions. La Niña has a well-documented cooling effect on global average temperatures. Typically, the temperature difference between a strong El Niño year and a subsequent La Niña year is greater than the warming effect from a single year of climate change. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that May 2025 will be one of the warmest Mays on record, but not break the specific record set during the preceding El Niño peak.\n\nThe information from my research assistant supports the idea of continued, exceptional heat but doesn't guarantee a record. A forecast for 2025 to be a 'top three or five' hottest year is consistent with this view—it would be an extremely hot year, but not necessarily breaking the record set in 2023/2024. Similarly, a hot summer in the US is a regional forecast that doesn't directly determine the global monthly average.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because the long-term warming trend is powerful and relentless. There is a non-trivial chance that the baseline warming is now so high that it can overcome the ENSO cycle's influence, or that other sources of natural variability could align to favor more warmth. My forecast is not higher because the historical impact of the ENSO cycle on year-over-year temperature records is very strong, making the transition to a cooler phase a significant barrier to setting a new record.\n\nI would increase my probability if climate models in early 2025 showed a surprisingly weak La Niña or a rapid return toward neutral conditions. I would decrease my probability if a strong and persistent La Niña develops faster than currently anticipated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
