    "review": "Both forecasters correctly stress the exact-phrase constraint and the narrow June 10–30 window, which strongly biases toward No unless the term is directly quoted. I agree with Forecaster 2’s emphasis on NYT style favoring established terms (“reverse auction,” “buyback/repurchase,” “reverse repo”) and the possibility that a single newsletter mention would suffice. The main new angle is Forecaster 3’s Russia pathway (“reverse purchase” of assets). That’s a useful consideration I hadn’t weighed. However, I’m skeptical NYT would choose that exact phrasing; “buyback,” “repurchase,” or “forced buyback” seem more likely, and any prior coverage may have already standardized alternative wording. Still, it adds a plausible, if slim, second route beyond the China trend translation. Overall, I find F2’s 8% more consistent with the base-rate constraints; F3’s 12% feels a bit high given NYT diction norms and the three-week window.",
    "rationale": "Key points unchanged: the required exact strings are uncommon in NYT style; the window is short; and similar concepts (“reverse repurchase,” “reverse auction,” “reverse book-building”) don’t qualify. The most credible Yes path is a China business/feature piece that explicitly quotes People’s Daily’s term and renders it as “reverse purchasing” in English, or a newsletter blurb that does the same. A secondary, lower-probability path is Russia coverage that quotes “reverse purchase” from an official translation or wire language. Given the short horizon and editorial tendencies, the base remains low. I update slightly upward from 7% to 8% to account for the additional Russia pathway and the possibility of a newsletter one-off mention, but I remain cautious due to strong likelihood of alternative wording and the tight window.",
