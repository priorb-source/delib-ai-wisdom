  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the site remains offline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration maintains its stated policy direction of eliminating climate-focused initiatives within the Department of Defense. Secretary Hegseth continues to prioritize 'war-fighting' over climate programs, and the climate.mil portal remains offline through July 1, 2025, as it has been since at least early May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site is restored due to legal challenges, Congressional pressure, or operational necessities. Alternatively, there could be a policy shift within the administration, or technical/administrative decisions lead to the portal being brought back online for purposes related to military readiness or international obligations that require climate data access.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. Key evidence includes: (1) The site has already been down for at least 15 days as of the question date; (2) Secretary Hegseth has made explicit, unambiguous statements calling climate programs 'nonsense' and 'ripe for cuts'; (3) The administration has taken concrete policy actions including revoking the January 2021 executive order on climate crisis; (4) Climate change is no longer considered a national security issue by this administration. The policy direction is clear and leadership has demonstrated follow-through on removing climate-related content from federal websites. Why not lower: Six weeks provides some time for unexpected developments - legal challenges, Congressional interventions, or operational requirements could emerge. Some military planning functions may require climate data, creating pressure for restoration. Bureaucratic processes are complex and sometimes unpredictable. Why not higher: The policy statements are extraordinarily clear and direct. The administration has already demonstrated willingness to remove climate content. The site has been offline for weeks with no indication of restoration plans. The leadership's ideological stance appears firm. For me to update higher, I would need to see: legal rulings mandating restoration, Congressional action with teeth, high-level DoD officials pushing back publicly, or signs of the site being prepared for relaunch. For me to update lower, I would need additional time passing with continued inaction or additional statements reinforcing the permanence of the removal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
