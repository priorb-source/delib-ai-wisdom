    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Dow Jones Industrial Average keeps all current constituents through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No major corporate actions, crises, or sector-balance motivations arise; the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee sees no urgent need to tweak composition after multiple 2024 changes, so they make no announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The committee announces a change to improve sector representation or address price-weighting concerns (e.g., swapping out Verizon, 3M, IBM, or Boeing for a mega-cap like Alphabet or Meta); or a constituent faces an acute crisis/transaction (e.g., severe Boeing deterioration or a large spinoff/merger) prompting removal. Even an announcement of a future effective date would resolve Yes.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: DJIA changes are infrequent and lumpy. In the past decade, there have been years with multiple changes (2013, 2020, 2024) but also long stretches of stability. A rough annualized base rate is well under 1 change per year, implying low odds in any given two-month window.\n- Recency: The index saw notable adjustments in 2024 (including Nvidia replacing Intel and Amazon replacing Walgreens). After sizable recent updates, the committee typically exhibits a “settling” period absent a strong catalyst.\n- Triggers needed for a near-term change: a) major corporate action (spin/merger), b) severe company-specific crisis, or c) a desire to add a newly eligible, highly representative firm after a split or other event. None of these are visible to me right now. While there is ongoing noise around some constituents (e.g., Boeing’s operational/regulatory issues), the committee has historically tolerated prolonged turbulence without immediate removal.\n- Timing: The committee can announce changes at any time with little notice, and the question resolves on announcement (not effective date). This keeps a small but real tail risk.\n- Assistant research: No additional information available, so I’m leaning on historical cadence and known patterns.\nWhy not higher: Recent rebalancing in 2024, lack of clear imminent catalysts, and historically low probability of a change within a 2-month window.\nWhy not lower: The committee occasionally makes abrupt changes; plausible candidates exist for replacement to improve sector representation; and any late-June announcement (even for a later effective date) would resolve Yes.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting (WSJ/Bloomberg/S&P DJI) of potential DJIA changes; material deterioration or corporate actions at a constituent; a major split or event making a high-profile outsider (e.g., Alphabet/Meta/Chipotle) a timely add. What would move me down: Passing of key dates without rumors, stabilization/improvement at at-risk constituents, and explicit public commentary from S&P DJI indicating no near-term changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
