    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that was highly aligned with my own, creating a strong consensus. We all identified the same key drivers for a low probability: the extremely short timeframe (~6 weeks), the negative evidence from robust post-COVID surveillance systems, the virus's low cell-entry efficiency, and the low historical base rate of zoonotic spillover. Their arguments were convincing and reinforced my initial analysis. The primary difference was their convergence on a 2% forecast versus my 1%. This small difference reflects a slightly higher weighting of the tail risk—the small but non-zero possibility of a single stochastic event. Forecaster 3's explicit mention that HKU5-CoV-2 belongs to the Merbecovirus family (like MERS) was a useful framing for this tail risk, even if it doesn't change the fundamental probability of a spillover event occurring.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward slightly from 1% to 2%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the probability of a human case of HKU5-CoV-2 being reported before July 1, 2025, is extremely low. This is primarily due to the very short time remaining and the strong negative evidence from active surveillance programs, which have detected no signals of the virus. Furthermore, the virus's confirmed low cell-entry efficiency presents a significant biological barrier. However, the deliberation with my peers, who both independently converged on a 2% forecast, has persuaded me that my initial 1% may have been slightly under-confident. Adjusting to 2% better reflects the consensus view on the small, non-zero probability of a rare event, such as a lab accident or a single spillover infection, being detected in the coming weeks. This small adjustment brings my forecast into alignment with the group's, acknowledging the collective judgment on the magnitude of this tail risk.",
