  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question resolves on July 1, 2025, which is less than two months from the current date of May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) has not announced the host for the 2026 World Championship.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite a positive meeting with Egyptian officials, the ITKF's internal administrative and approval processes are slower than anticipated. The federation either decides to postpone the announcement to allow for other potential bids or simply fails to issue the formal communication before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the momentum from the April 29, 2025 meeting, and with Egypt being the only publicly known bidder, the ITKF leadership fast-tracks the decision. An official announcement is made via the ITKF website or a press release in May or June 2025, confirming Egypt as the host.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several strong positive indicators. The most significant is the high-level meeting on April 29, 2025, between Egypt's Minister of Sports and the ITKF President, Gilberto Gartner. President Gartner's subsequent public praise for Egypt's organizational capabilities and infrastructure serves as a strong endorsement. Furthermore, Egypt has a proven track record of successfully hosting major international sporting events, including karate championships, which reduces the perceived risk for the ITKF. Critically, there are no other publicly reported bids for the 2026 championship, positioning Egypt as the clear frontrunner. The timing of an announcement in the next two months would also align with the ITKF's typical pattern of selecting hosts 24-36 months in advance.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 70% due to the short timeframe before the July 1 deadline. International sports federations can have slow bureaucratic processes, and a formal announcement could easily be delayed by administrative hurdles, even if the decision in principle has been made. The status quo is 'no announcement,' and inertia is a significant factor.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 70% because the combination of a direct, high-level meeting, public endorsement from the federation's president, and the lack of any competition makes a positive outcome highly likely. The primary uncertainty is the exact timing of the announcement, not the decision itself.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the ITKF releases any statement indicating a final decision is imminent. I would decrease it if a competing bid emerges or if the end of June approaches with no further communication from either party.",
