  "information": "Implementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya's deep-seated political fragmentation and division between its rival eastern and western governments persists. The legislature, the House of Representatives, remains unable to convene effectively or agree on a legislative agenda, making the ratification of a major international trade agreement impossible before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen and rapid political breakthrough, likely mediated by international powers, results in a functional unity government. As a symbolic act of progress and re-engagement with the international community, the newly empowered legislature fast-tracks and approves the AfCFTA ratification instrument.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by Libya's chronic political instability and divided governance. The country has not had a stable, unified government capable of consistently passing legislation for over a decade. The status quo is one of legislative paralysis, and with only two months until the deadline, this is the most likely state to persist. Libya signed the AfCFTA agreement in July 2019, but has made no progress towards ratification in the nearly six years since, demonstrating that this is not a political priority amidst internal conflict. The research assistant's report, which highlights implementation delays and extended timelines for AfCFTA across the continent (e.g., tariff removal by 2034), further reduces any external pressure on Libya to act with urgency. My probability is not lower than 2% because I avoid assigning absolute certainty to any forecast; an improbable diplomatic breakthrough is always a remote possibility. My probability is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome would require a fundamental and rapid resolution to a decade-long political crisis, which is an exceptionally high bar to clear in two months. I would significantly increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a successful power-sharing agreement and the House of Representatives placing AfCFTA ratification on its official agenda.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
