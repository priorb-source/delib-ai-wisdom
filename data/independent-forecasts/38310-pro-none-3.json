    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The G7 summit is scheduled for June 2025, and the outcome will be known by the end of the month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has been formally invited by the host nation, Canada. He has a consistent track record of attending major international summits in person to advocate for Ukraine's cause, and the strategic importance of doing so remains exceptionally high.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe military escalation in Ukraine, such as a major new Russian offensive threatening a key city like Kyiv or Kharkiv, would require President Zelenskyy's presence in the country, forcing him to cancel his in-person travel. Alternatively, a specific, high-level security threat could make the trip prohibitively dangerous.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo prevails. The military situation, while serious, remains stable enough for President Zelenskyy to travel. Seeing the summit as a critical opportunity to secure further military and financial aid, he accepts the invitation and travels to Kananaskis, Canada, to meet with G7 leaders in person.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong precedent and overwhelming strategic motivation for President Zelenskyy to attend. He attended the G7 summits in 2023 and 2024 in person, establishing a clear pattern. The G7 represents Ukraine's most vital partners, and this summit is the premier forum for him to lobby for continued support. The invitation from the Canadian Prime Minister has been extended, satisfying a key precondition. The feasibility of such travel, while risky, has been proven multiple times.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because of the inherent and non-trivial risks associated with being the leader of a country at war. A sudden battlefield crisis or a specific, credible security threat are real possibilities that could force a last-minute cancellation. The situation remains dynamic and unpredictable.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the factors favoring his attendance are exceptionally strong. For him not to attend, there would need to be a major deviation from the current state of affairs. The strategic cost of missing this opportunity for in-person diplomacy is very high for Ukraine. \n\nI would lower my forecast upon receiving credible intelligence of a major, imminent Russian offensive or specific threats to his travel. I would raise it slightly if Ukrainian or Canadian officials officially confirm his travel schedule in the days preceding the summit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
