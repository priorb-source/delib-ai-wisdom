    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was significantly more optimistic than my peers' forecasts of 40% and 42%. After reviewing their analyses, I find their reasoning more persuasive than my own. Both forecasters correctly identified the central tension: the positive signal of a license being granted six months ago versus the negative signal of no visible progress since then, coupled with a very short time remaining until the deadline.\n\nI had heavily weighted the license approval, viewing it as the primary obstacle and assuming the subsequent steps were a formality that would be completed well within the total 8.5-month window. Forecasters 2 and 3 convinced me that I underweight two critical factors:\n1.  The elapsed time as a negative signal: The fact that six months have already passed without activation is not neutral; it's evidence suggesting either deprioritization of the Chadian market or unforeseen logistical/bureaucratic hurdles. My assumption that this was 'normal prep time' was too simplistic, as precedent in other African nations shows highly variable rollout timelines.\n2.  The short deadline: With only ~1.5 months remaining, the status quo (not available) becomes a much stronger predictor. Any minor delay, which might be insignificant on a longer timeline, becomes decisive here. A launch in July or August 2025 is a very plausible outcome, which would resolve this question as 'No'.\n\nTheir reasoning, especially regarding the lack of any secondary positive signals (like marketing or government announcements) and the potential for Chad to be a lower-priority market, has led me to conclude my initial forecast was overconfident.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 75% to 41%. The primary reason for this large shift is my acceptance of the arguments made by the other forecasters, which exposed flaws in my initial analysis.\n\nMy initial forecast rested almost entirely on the November 2024 license approval, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for service launch. The other forecasters correctly highlighted that the subsequent six months of inaction is a strong piece of countervailing evidence. While Starlink has the technical capability to 'flip a switch,' the delay suggests that the groundwork is either not complete or not a priority.\n\nFurthermore, the short remaining time window of approximately six weeks dramatically increases the probability that even minor, common delays will push the launch past the July 1 deadline. My previous 75% forecast implied a very high degree of certainty that the launch would occur in this specific narrow window, which is not supported by the evidence or by Starlink's variable rollout patterns in the region. Some countries have waited 8-16 months after license approval for service.\n\nBy moving my forecast to 41%, I am now more aligned with my peers. The forecast remains below 50% because the status quo is 'No', and the burden of proof is on the 'Yes' outcome to happen within a tight deadline without any clear leading indicators. However, it is not significantly lower because the license is secured, and a rapid activation within the next six weeks remains a distinct possibility, preventing a more pessimistic forecast.",
