  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, the U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Niger is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' last updated on March 21, 2023. The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific areas within Niger are designated as Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' including the Diffa region, the Lake Chad basin, and regions bordering Mali. Neighboring countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have nationwide Level 4 advisories.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger would maintain its current Level 3 travel advisory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US State Department maintains Niger's nationwide Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025, with only specific regions remaining at Level 4. The security situation remains challenging but not severe enough to warrant a nationwide Level 4 designation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident occurs (such as attacks on Western interests or Americans), or there is significant deterioration in Niger's security situation, prompting the State Department to upgrade the entire country to Level 4 before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors maintaining the status quo. Niger has held a Level 3 advisory since at least March 2023 (over 2 years), suggesting the State Department's assessment has been stable despite significant regional instability, including Niger's July 2023 coup. This stability in classification indicates a high threshold for upgrading to Level 4. \n\nKey considerations against an upgrade: (1) The State Department has already carefully calibrated the advisory by designating specific high-risk areas (Diffa region, Lake Chad basin, Mali border regions) as Level 4 while keeping the nationwide level at 3, suggesting deliberate differentiation; (2) Level 4 advisories for entire countries are relatively rare and typically reserved for active war zones, complete security breakdowns, or explicitly hostile states; (3) The 60-day timeframe is short for major policy changes; (4) No current reporting suggests an imminent upgrade is under consideration.\n\nFactors creating some upside risk: (1) Neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso already have nationwide Level 4 advisories, indicating regional instability; (2) Multiple areas within Niger already meet Level 4 criteria; (3) The stated reasons (terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest) are serious; (4) The advisory hasn't been updated since March 2023, so a review might be overdue; (5) Any incident involving American citizens could trigger rapid reassessment.\n\nMy forecast balances strong status quo bias against genuine regional security risks. I'm not higher because the State Department has demonstrated reluctance to upgrade despite two years of challenges. I'm not lower because the regional context and existing Level 4 zones create meaningful escalation risk, particularly in a 60-day window where even one significant incident could trigger change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 2, 2025, the U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Niger is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' last updated on March 21, 2023. The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific areas within Niger are designated as Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' including the Diffa region, the Lake Chad basin, and regions bordering Mali. Neighboring countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have nationwide Level 4 advisories.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
