  "information": "Multiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 3 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, the NFL does not ban the play, as it is currently legal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL's Spring League Meeting concludes without a successful vote on the 'Tush-Push,' or no special meeting is called before the deadline. The factions of owners who benefit from the play and those concerned about changing rules on competitive grounds hold firm, preventing the league from reaching the 24-vote threshold required for a rule change.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the upcoming Spring League Meeting, the NFL's executive office, led by Commissioner Goodell, alongside the Competition Committee, makes a strong and successful push centered on player safety. They convince a supermajority of owners (24 of 32) that the play is an injury risk and deviates from the spirit of the game, leading to an official announcement of a ban before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the extremely short timeframe. The deadline is less than three weeks away, and major NFL rule changes typically occur during the Annual League Meeting in March, which has already passed. For a change to happen now, it would likely need to be voted on at the Spring League Meeting this month. The research report notes that a vote was already tabled due to a lack of consensus. Overcoming that level of division and achieving a 24-owner supermajority in such a short period is a very high bar. While there is significant pressure from the Commissioner's office and health officials, citing player safety concerns, this is counteracted by powerful teams, like the Eagles, who have a strong competitive interest in keeping the play legal. The inertia of the current rulebook is a powerful force, and there is not enough time left for the tide to likely turn. My probability is not lower than 15% because the push from a Commissioner who wants the play gone is a significant factor, and a compelling new safety report could theoretically accelerate a vote. My probability is not higher because the procedural hurdles and the demonstrated lack of consensus make a swift ban before June 1 highly improbable. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports that previously opposed owners have flipped their votes. Conversely, if the Spring meeting agenda is released without the 'Tush-Push' on it, my forecast would decrease significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
