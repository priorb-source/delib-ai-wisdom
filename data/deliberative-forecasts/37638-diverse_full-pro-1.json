    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was too high. While I correctly identified the strong opposition in the Texas House and the tight legislative timeline as major barriers, I failed to appreciate two critical points raised by the other forecasters. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized that the House isn't just passively resisting; it is actively pursuing an opposite policy by expanding medical access and crafting a substitute bill that is only a partial ban. This indicates a hardened, well-defined opposition, not just a negotiating posture. More importantly, Forecaster 3 made a crucial observation about the resolution criteria that I had overlooked: the question requires a law that **fully prohibits** the sale of THC. As they correctly point out, even the Senate's aggressive anti-THC bill (SB 3) aims to ban products outside the state's medical marijuana program, not the program itself. Given the overwhelming bipartisan support in the House for expanding this medical program, the prospect of the legislature not only banning hemp products but also dismantling the existing medical system to achieve a 'full prohibition' of all THC sales is exceedingly remote. This insight fundamentally narrows the path to a 'Yes' outcome to a near-impossibility.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 15% to 4%. My initial analysis focused on the political battle over Senate Bill 3, weighing the strong push from the Senate leadership against the clear resistance from the House. However, the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, convincingly argued that the resolution criterion—a 'full prohibition' on THC sales—sets a much higher bar than in-flight legislation is attempting to clear. The Texas legislature is currently debating the prohibition of hemp-derived intoxicants, not the abolition of THC sales altogether, which would necessitate eliminating the state's Compassionate Use (medical) Program. The House just voted 118-16 to expand that very program. Therefore, for this question to resolve 'Yes', the legislature would have to completely reverse course, overcome the already-significant procedural and political hurdles to ban hemp products, and then go a step further to eliminate the medical program, all before July 1, 2025. This confluence of events is exceptionally unlikely. I am maintaining a small probability above zero to account for extreme, unforeseen political events, but the combined weight of bicameral disagreement, gubernatorial indifference, a tight timeline, and the exceptionally high bar of the resolution criteria warrants a substantial downgrade of the probability.",
