  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Without the new political intervention, CDC public health recommendations change very slowly due to extensive processes for scientific review and public comment. The 2015 update took four years, so the 0.7 mg/L recommendation would almost certainly remain in place through July 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The HHS Secretary, using his authority over the CDC, issues a direct and urgent instruction to rescind the current recommendation immediately. In response, the CDC either removes the webpage or adds a prominent disclaimer that the 0.7 mg/L recommendation is formally withdrawn pending review. This change is implemented before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the HHS Secretary's announcement, the institutional inertia of the CDC prevents a formal change to the recommendation by the deadline. The process of convening a task force, conducting a review, and issuing a new recommendation takes longer than the six weeks available. The webpage remains online with the 0.7 mg/L recommendation, possibly with a new note that the guidance is under review, which would not alter the outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflict between strong, top-down political will for change and the significant institutional inertia of a federal public health agency. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the extremely short timeframe. The CDC's last revision to this recommendation took four years, and it is highly improbable that a full, scientifically-backed process to change it again could be completed in just six weeks. Bureaucratic processes, even when politically expedited, require time. The path of least resistance for the agency is to initiate the requested review while leaving the existing guidance in place until the review is complete. However, the probability is not higher than 70% because the pressure for change is exceptionally strong and comes directly from the HHS Secretary, a political appointee with a well-known, long-standing position on this specific issue. His instruction to 'stop recommending' fluoridation, combined with concurrent actions at the EPA and FDA, signals a powerful, coordinated effort that could potentially bypass normal procedures. A 'No' outcome could be achieved swiftly not by issuing a new recommendation, but by simply withdrawing the current one via a direct order. I would decrease my probability if there is a public announcement of a specific directive from HHS to the CDC with a deadline before July 1. I would increase my probability if CDC officials publicly state that any review will be a lengthy, evidence-based process, reinforcing the power of institutional procedure over immediate political pressure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
