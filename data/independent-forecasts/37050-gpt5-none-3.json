    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — none of the current 30 constituents are announced for removal from the DJIA before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no membership announcement. No major stock splits or corporate actions among Dow components force a sector-balance tweak. Boeing’s issues do not escalate to a level that prompts a symbolic removal. The committee opts for stability given recent 2024 changes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a membership change before July 1. Plausible catalysts: - Boeing’s crisis worsens (regulatory or production shock), prompting a reputational/representative switch. - 3M, Verizon, or another laggard is swapped to better reflect the economy. - A large component announces a split/merger/spin that materially distorts price-weight sector balance, and the committee uses it to rebalance, announcing a removal before July 1 (effective immediately or shortly after).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: DJIA changes are infrequent and often cluster around corporate actions (splits, mergers, spin-offs) or broad representational adjustments. Since 2010 there have been roughly 5–6 change events (2013, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024), implying about one event every 2–3 years. Announcements usually come with only days’ notice, but the annualized base rate over a short 2-month window is low. Recent context: In Feb 2024, the index already made notable changes (e.g., Intel→NVIDIA, Walgreens→Amazon). That recent refresh lowers near-term odds of another shakeup. Catalysts: Boeing’s ongoing troubles are the most salient wildcard; a severe deterioration could prompt a swap. 3M’s restructuring/spin and legacy liabilities were potential concerns, but recent stabilization reduces immediate pressure. No widely telegraphed large Dow component split or M&A is currently in play that would force rebalancing. Why not higher: The short time window and historically low frequency of changes, plus the recency of 2024 adjustments, argue for a modest probability. Why not lower: Non-zero risk remains from an acute corporate crisis (especially Boeing) or an unexpected split/transaction that the committee uses to rebalance sector exposure. What would move me up: - Credible reporting (WSJ/Bloomberg) that S&P DJI is considering a change. - A major negative inflection at Boeing (regulatory actions, catastrophic earnings/production news). - Announcement of a large split/transaction at a high-price component that would skew sector weights. What would move me down: - Clear stabilization headlines for Boeing and absence of major corporate actions through late June. Research assistant: No additional information available; no new signals to alter base-rate-driven view.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
