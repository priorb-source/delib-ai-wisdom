    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was primarily driven by the May 2025 announcement that the UK had joined a French initiative for recognition, which I interpreted as a strong signal of imminent, coordinated action by two P5 members. The other forecasters provided critical context that challenges this view. Forecaster 2's argument regarding the UK's July 4th election is decisive; pre-election caretaker conventions make a UK recognition in June almost impossible. This single point invalidates a key pillar of my original thesis. Forecaster 3’s analysis, while closer to my own, introduced a more specific positive catalyst I had not considered: reports that Malta is preparing to act at a high-level UN conference in June. Both forecasters rightly identified this June 17-20 conference as a key focal point that could catalyze action. I find the counterarguments, particularly regarding the UK, highly convincing and they necessitate a downward revision of my forecast. However, the new information about the conference and Malta as a specific actor provides a plausible alternative path to a 'Yes' outcome, preventing a more drastic reduction.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 65% to 58%. The primary reason for this downward revision is the new information, raised by Forecaster 2, that the United Kingdom's July 4th general election effectively prohibits it from making a major foreign policy decision like recognizing Palestine in June. My initial assessment that a Franco-British tandem was driving imminent action is therefore incorrect for this specific timeframe. This significantly reduces the probability of a major Western power leading the move in June. However, I am not lowering my forecast more substantially because the deliberation also introduced stronger, more specific catalysts for a 'Yes' outcome. Both other forecasters highlighted the June 17-20 conference on the two-state solution, co-chaired by France, which creates a natural, high-profile deadline and venue for an announcement. Furthermore, Forecaster 3 noted specific reports about Malta, an EU member that has previously signaled its readiness, preparing to recognize Palestine at this summit. The resolution now appears less likely to come from a G7 power and more likely to come from a smaller European state seizing the diplomatic stage. My updated forecast of 58% reflects this new understanding: the path to a 'Yes' is narrower and relies on different actors than I first thought, but the presence of a clear catalyst and a specific, plausible candidate country still makes this outcome more likely than not.",
