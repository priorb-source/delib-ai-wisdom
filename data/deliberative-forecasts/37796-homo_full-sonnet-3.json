    "review": "The other forecasters make cogent arguments anchored on the same 94% historical base rate. Forecaster 2 raises an interesting point about February 2025's recent changes potentially reducing June's likelihood, though I'm not convinced this matters given countries are at different stages in the continuous process. More importantly, Forecaster 2 correctly notes that South Africa explicitly targets October 2025, not June, so I should remove that from my June candidates. Forecaster 3 appropriately emphasizes we're 3-5 weeks from the meeting, meaning timing is actually quite tight for last-minute completions. Both forecasters advocate for respecting the 6% base rate of no changes more conservatively, suggesting 87-88% rather than my 92%. Their caution about execution risk is warranted - even with positive on-site visits, formal approvals could be delayed; procedural issues could arise; countries might not fully complete requirements in time.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting slightly downward but maintaining a forecast above theirs. The core evidence remains compelling: (1) The 94% base rate of changes since 2018, with only COVID-affected October 2020 as an exception; (2) Mozambique completed reforms and had a positive April 2025 on-site visit - the timing aligns well for June announcement; (3) British Virgin Islands has expired grace period (February 2025, now 3+ months past) and UK support for listing - this is a particularly strong addition candidate; (4) Nigeria explicitly targets end-of-May exit. The key insight is multiple independent pathways to YES. Even if Mozambique and Nigeria face delays, the BVI situation alone provides a strong probability of change. The expired grace period is particularly significant - it's been over 3 months, suggesting the decision point has arrived. However, I'm adjusting down from 92% to respect execution uncertainty and acknowledge that even strong candidates can face procedural delays. The other forecasters' caution is prudent, but I believe the confluence of factors here - multiple ready candidates, appropriate timing, BVI's particularly strong case - justifies remaining above their 87-88% range.",
