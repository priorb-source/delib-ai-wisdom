    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No ban",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Bundestag does not file (or fails to pass) a petition to the Federal Constitutional Court, or it files but the Court does not issue a final ruling before July 1, 2025. Debate and evidence-gathering continue, but no official ban is announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An extraordinarily accelerated proceeding in which the Federal Constitutional Court accepts a petition, holds hearings, and issues a final party-ban judgment within weeks—announcing an official ban before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Process and authority: Only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party under Art. 21(2) of the Basic Law. Historical party-ban cases have taken years (e.g., NPD proceedings ~2–4 years). An official, final ban by July 1 would require an exceptionally compressed timeline.\n- Current state: A cross-party group of 124 MPs placed a motion on the agenda to initiate proceedings, but the Bundestag would still need to pass a formal petition by majority, or the Federal Government/Bundesrat would need to file. As of May 2, there is no indication a petition has been filed and accepted, let alone that hearings are scheduled.\n- Legal bar: The Court applies strict standards and has historically been cautious (e.g., 2017 NPD ruling found anti-constitutional aims but declined a ban due to lack of potential). Even if the AfD’s capacity element is easier to argue, evidentiary development and due process still make a pre–July 1 final ban highly unlikely.\n- Status quo weight: With roughly two months left and no formal, advanced-stage proceeding evident, the baseline is “No ban by the deadline.”\n- Why not higher: The combination of limited time, procedural steps (filing, admissibility, evidence, hearing, deliberation), and the Court’s historic pace makes a rapid ban extraordinarily unlikely.\n- Why not lower: A non-zero chance exists if a petition is filed immediately and the Court uniquely expedites due to an acute constitutional risk, or if there is an unforeseen emergency prompting extraordinary measures.\n- What would move me upward: (1) Formal filing by a competent organ and immediate acceptance by the Court; (2) Announcement of an expedited schedule with hearings set in May/June; (3) Public signals from the Court indicating readiness to conclude swiftly; (4) Emergence of compelling, urgent evidence of imminent threats tied to the party prompting extraordinary acceleration.\n- What would move me downward: (1) No filing by late May; (2) Filing but no expedited timetable; (3) Indications the government prefers funding cuts or surveillance measures over a ban.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was provided beyond the cited article about the Bundestag debate; hence, the forecast relies on known legal procedures and historical timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
