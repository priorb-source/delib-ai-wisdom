  "information": "In May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the DV Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains accessible at the specified URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department reorganizes or migrates travel.state.gov and removes or renames this specific page (resulting in a 404 or a different path without a redirect), or the DV program is suspended/ended and the page is taken down before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The DV program continues as usual; the instructions page remains published year-round (even though the entry window opens in the fall) and the specific URL continues to resolve to the page.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/continuity: The DV program is established in statute (INA 203(c)). Ending it would require congressional action, which is unlikely on this short timeline. Historically, State keeps DV instruction pages live year-round, even when the entry period is closed. Government web content, especially high-traffic program pages, tends to be stable across years to preserve inbound links.\n- The research assistant’s items (visa restrictions on certain Indian travel agents, TPS changes for Afghanistan and litigation around Venezuelan TPS) are unrelated to the DV program and do not suggest imminent changes to DV web content.\n- Key risks holding the forecast below ~95%: (1) a travel.state.gov CMS restructure that changes or removes this exact slug without leaving a working redirect; (2) an unforeseen web outage or security incident around the check date; (3) an editorial consolidation that relocates the DV step-by-step pages to a new path. Metaculus’s criterion specifies the page “is at this location,” so if a redirect does not count, URL changes matter more.\n- What would raise my probability: Confirmation that this exact URL is currently live and has been stable over multiple prior cycles; explicit evidence that State/OES/Consular Affairs is not planning a web restructure; clarification that a redirect to the same content would count as “at this location.”\n- What would lower my probability: Any announcement of a travel.state.gov site migration, observed deprecation of similar step-by-step pages, or credible policy moves to curtail the DV program before July 1.\nGiven these, the status quo strongly favors the page still being online at the same URL by July 1, but I retain risk for technical/URL changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
