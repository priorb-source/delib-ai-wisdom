    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning largely matches my baseline: short timeline, regime consolidation, weak and slow judicial leverage, and limited external pressure post‑ECOWAS exit. Useful additions: (1) emphasis that a face‑saving rescission paired with a de facto freeze would still satisfy resolution criteria; (2) explicit note that alternative security partnerships reduce Western leverage; (3) potential roles for AU or influential partners (Algeria, Russia) in brokering a tactical concession. None of these shift the base case materially absent concrete signals, but they sharpen the edges of the small upside tail.\n",
    "rationale": "The junta’s incentives (prevent coordination by opponents, control the transition) and behavior (legal rollback via CNT, arrests, prior party suspensions) argue against a quick about‑face within ~40 days. Courts are unlikely to deliver a fast, enforceable reversal, and even if they did, compliance before July 1 is uncertain. International condemnation has modest leverage, and Mali’s posture reduces sensitivity to Western pressure. A qualifying Yes remains possible via a tactical concession—rescinding the decree (even if paired with informal constraints), or a court ruling the junta chooses to honor—especially if tied to AU mediation or elite‑level incentives. However, I do not see new evidence that increases the likelihood of such a move within the window. Given this, I keep my probability low and unchanged.\n",
