    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 2%, which provides convergent validation of this estimate. The other forecasters raised several points worth highlighting: Forecaster 3's quantification that the 57-day period would consume only ~$2M at current burn rates (leaving $223M+) is particularly helpful for contextualizing the timeline. Forecaster 2's observation that 57 days is insufficient for typical bankruptcy preparation adds an important procedural constraint I hadn't explicitly emphasized. Both forecasters correctly note that the NYSE non-compliance is a stock price issue, not a liquidity crisis, and can be resolved through reverse splits without bankruptcy implications. The convergence on 2% across three independent analyses suggests this probability appropriately captures the tail risk of unforeseen catastrophic events while acknowledging the objectively strong financial position relative to the extremely short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, my assessment remains unchanged at 2%. The financial fundamentals strongly support this low probability: (1) Cash runway calculation: $225.6M cash with $3M quarterly burn equals 75+ quarters of runway. Over the 57-day period, expected cash usage is only ~$2M, leaving over $223M. (2) No debt maturities until 2028 eliminates refinancing pressure. (3) Recent positive signal: Just secured $19M in NEVI funding on May 1, 2025, four days ago. (4) Improving unit economics: Cash burn decreased from $31M to $3M quarter-over-quarter, gross margins improved to 30%, subscription revenue growing 14%. (5) Procedural constraints: Even if the company wanted to file, 57 days is typically insufficient for bankruptcy preparation. The 2% probability reflects genuine tail risk (accounting fraud, undisclosed liabilities, complete customer loss, or other black swan events) rather than concerns about the company's ability to meet obligations. The stock market's concern (sub-$1 price) warrants some non-zero probability, but the objective financial data for this specific 57-day window is unambiguous. I see no compelling reason to update from 2%.",
