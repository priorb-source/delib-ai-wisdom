    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a similar overall assessment: a referendum announcement is unlikely but remains a distinct possibility due to the current escalated tensions. Both Forecaster 2 (20%) and Forecaster 3 (24%) correctly emphasize that while Milorad Dodik has a history of brinkmanship, the recent legislative groundwork is more advanced than in previous cycles, justifying a non-trivial probability. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly insightful. The points about Dodik's strategic preference for the 'leverage of ambiguity' (which a firm date would sacrifice) and the historical precedent of shelving a 2016 referendum are strong arguments for the 'No' case. Conversely, their articulation of a specific trigger—such as an attempt by the state to enforce property rulings—provides a very clear and plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome that I had considered more generically. These analyses provide a well-rounded view that captures the key dynamics at play.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast slightly upward to 18%. The primary reason for this change is that my fellow forecasters convinced me that I was slightly underweighting the significance of the recent, concrete legislative steps taken by Republika Srpska. The completion of public consultation for a new constitution embedding self-determination is a tangible milestone that distinguishes the current crisis from past rhetorical escalations. This suggests the situation is more volatile and closer to a potential tipping point than I had initially priced in. However, I am not raising my forecast further because I find Forecaster 3's arguments about the powerful disincentives to be extremely convincing. Sacrificing strategic ambiguity by setting a date would force a direct confrontation with the US and EU, a showdown Dodik has historically avoided. The immense international pressure and the high, immediate costs of such an announcement remain the dominant factors. My revised forecast of 18% better reflects the balance between these unprecedented preparatory actions and the enduring strategic and geopolitical constraints.",
