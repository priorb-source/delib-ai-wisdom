    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raise important points I underweighted. However, there's a critical factual discrepancy: Forecaster 2 claims this is 'likely Class I' based on health hazard, which directly contradicts the research assistant's explicit statement that this is a 'Class III recall' - the lowest risk category. This is not ambiguous information. Forecaster 3 also expresses uncertainty about the classification despite it being stated clearly. The Class designation fundamentally affects closure timelines.\n\nThat said, both forecasters identify legitimate complicating factors I didn't adequately consider: (1) the large volume (212,268 pounds), (2) multi-state distribution making retrieval harder, (3) institutional foodservice channels being difficult to track, and (4) extended shelf life to March 2026 meaning products are deeply embedded in supply chains. These factors could delay closure even for a low-risk Class III recall.\n\nForecaster 3's data point about Class III median closure at ~90 days is valuable - this puts the 95-day window at the edge of what's typical, not comfortably within it. The fact that 40 of 95 days (42%) have elapsed with the recall still Active suggests the process isn't moving expeditiously, even for a precautionary Class III recall.\n\nForecaster 2's pessimism seems partly based on the incorrect Class I assumption, while Forecaster 3's 45% appears more balanced given the actual Class III designation combined with the complicating factors.",
    "rationale": "My original 60% forecast was too optimistic. While I correctly identified this as a Class III recall (low risk, no illnesses, precautionary), I underweighted several factors that could delay closure even for low-risk recalls: the significant product volume, complex multi-state distribution including institutional foodservice channels, and extended shelf life making product retrieval challenging.\n\nThe key insight from the deliberation is that even with a Class III designation, 40 days have passed without closure, and the 95-day total window leaves little margin given typical Class III median closure times around 90 days. We're not comfortably ahead of the deadline - we're at the edge of what's typical.\n\nHowever, I shouldn't drop to 35% because that forecast appears influenced by the incorrect assumption this is Class I. The Class III designation, lack of health consequences, and Cargill's resources as a major food company still favor eventual closure, just not as strongly as I initially thought.\n\nBalancing the Class III designation and precautionary nature against the elapsed time, complicating distribution factors, and tight timeline to July 1, I'm updating downward to 48%.",
