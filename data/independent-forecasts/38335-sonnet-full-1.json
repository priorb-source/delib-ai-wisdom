  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.\n\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.\n\nCasey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues to delay her decision, either due to the ongoing House probe into Hope Florida, strategic considerations about timing her announcement after the July 1 cutoff, or because she ultimately decides not to run for governor in 2026",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis decides to announce her candidacy before the June 30 fundraising deadline to establish herself as a serious competitor to Byron Donalds and begin raising money for the Q2 reporting period, leveraging her early favorable polling numbers",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. As of June 5, Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy and has only given noncommittal 'we'll see' responses. With just 26 days remaining until the July 1 deadline, there are no public reports of formal campaign preparations such as staff hires or fundraising filings with Florida's Division of Elections. The House probe into Hope Florida creates additional complications that likely make her hesitant to launch a campaign during negative scrutiny. Byron Donalds already has Trump's endorsement and is actively campaigning, which changes the competitive landscape. However, several factors prevent me from forecasting lower: The June 30 fundraising deadline creates a natural pressure point for announcement if she intends to run, as announcing before then would allow her to compete in Q2 fundraising. Historical timing patterns suggest 8-18 months before the August 2026 primary is typical for announcements, putting the current timeframe within normal bounds. Her early polling showed strong favorability among Republicans. She hasn't definitively ruled out running. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see evidence of campaign infrastructure being built, staff being hired, or more definitive signals of intent. For it to move lower, I would need her to make a statement ruling out a 2026 run or for the July 1 deadline to approach with no movement. Given the strong status quo bias, lack of visible preparation, and the House probe complication, but acknowledging the June 30 fundraising deadline as a potential catalyst, I assess the probability at 18%",
