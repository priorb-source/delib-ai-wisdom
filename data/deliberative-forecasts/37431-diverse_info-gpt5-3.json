    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces base-rate stats (mean 45 days, ~50% closed by 70 days), which would be highly relevant if accurate, but their figures are internally inconsistent (a mean below a stated 60–120 day “typical” range and a mean < median while calling it right-skewed). I treat that as suggestive but uncertain. Their framing that 68 days is just below the 70-day median supports a near coin flip. Forecaster 3 persuasively highlights that allergen/misbranding recalls limited to one state tend to be simpler and faster, and that effectiveness checks focus on consignees, not consumers, so the “frozen” factor shouldn’t materially delay closure. They may be a bit optimistic given the long production window and volume, which can add administrative complexity and risk of scope adjustments. Overall, F3’s qualitative arguments slightly outweigh F2’s uncertain quantitative claim, but both reinforce that this is close to even with a mild tilt to Yes.",
    "rationale": "I started at 57%, balancing a 68-day window against typical FSIS timelines for allergen/misbranding recalls. Incorporating the deliberation: (1) the single-state scope and allergen/misbranding nature likely reduce complexity and duration, and effectiveness checks don’t require consumer product retrieval, which supports a modest upward adjustment; (2) I discount Forecaster 2’s statistics due to internal inconsistencies but accept the broader implication that around 70 days is a rough median, keeping this near-even; (3) I retain caution for the long production span (Nov 2023–Apr 2025), the relatively large volume, and the possibility of a recall expansion or website update lag. Net effect: a slight increase, not approaching Forecaster 3’s 75% because the administrative and scope risks remain material. I would move higher if we see evidence of swift effectiveness checks or no expansion by early/mid-June; lower if there’s any scope expansion or signs of delays.",
