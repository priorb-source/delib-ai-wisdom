  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (admin check on or after June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Colorado remains last in MLB by winning percentage on/around June 15.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Colorado plays markedly better (e.g., ~.450 or better over the next ~25 games) while another bottom-tier team (e.g., White Sox/Marlins/Athletics) suffers a severe cold streak (e.g., ~.200 ball), pulling that team’s overall winning percentage below Colorado’s by June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Colorado continues to play sub-.300 ball against a tough slate; even with modest regression toward .300, their cumulative winning percentage stays well below the pack, and no other team collapses enough to undercut them by June 15 (ties for worst would still satisfy “lowest” on the MLB standings page).",
    "rationale": "As of mid-May, Colorado is 8-38 (.174), 112 points worse than the next-worst team (White Sox ~.286). Their -128 run differential, league-worst pitching (5.80 ERA, 1.599 WHIP) and offense (worst OPS, most strikeouts, poor BB% and HR%) indicate genuinely poor underlying quality, not just bad luck. They also face a challenging schedule before June 15. Even allowing for regression to preseason PECOTA (~.343), the window to materially close a .112 gap in overall winning percentage by mid-June is small. Over roughly 25 additional games, a typical outcome (Colorado ~.250–.350 ball; peers ~.300–.400) leaves the Rockies comfortably last by overall winning percentage. Managerial change and Tovar’s return could add a small boost, but the roster-level issues suggest limited short-term upside. Why not higher than this forecast? Baseball variance over ~25 games is real: a short hot streak for Colorado combined with an extreme cold streak by another cellar team could flip the order. New-manager bounce or key returns/trades for Colorado could also narrow the gap. Why not lower? The starting gap is very large, Colorado’s indicators are worst-in-MLB, and their near-term schedule is unfavorable—all consistent with them remaining last. What would change my view: I’d lower the probability if Colorado strings together, say, an 8–3 or better run while a competitor (e.g., White Sox/Marlins) drops 10+ straight, sharply compressing the gap by early June. I’d raise it if Colorado continues ≤.300 over the next two weeks while other bottom teams play ≥.350, keeping the gap wide heading into June 15.",
