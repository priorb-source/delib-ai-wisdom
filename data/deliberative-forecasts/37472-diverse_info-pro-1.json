    "review": "The other two forecasters provide compelling and specific evidence that tempers my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 rightly points out that public vows to return are common political rhetoric for exiled leaders and highlights the specific and severe legal jeopardy Hasina faces, including an imminent probe report. This adds significant weight to the argument against a voluntary return. Forecaster 3's contribution is even more impactful, providing concrete details about the extradition request submitted in December 2024 and the lack of an Indian response as of February 2025. This procedural detail strongly suggests that an involuntary return via extradition is extremely unlikely within the short 7-week resolution window. Both analyses convincingly argue that the status quo of Hasina remaining in exile in India is stable and supported by strong incentives (personal safety, legal avoidance) and a lack of external pressure (from India).",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 20% to 15%. My initial analysis placed significant weight on the political pressure created by Khaleda Zia's recent return, viewing it as a potential catalyst for a high-stakes, rapid return by Hasina. While I still believe this is the most significant factor in favor of a 'Yes' resolution, the other forecasters have convinced me that I underestimated the strength of the countervailing forces. Forecaster 3's reporting on the slow-moving, non-urgent nature of the extradition request effectively reduces the probability of an involuntary return to near zero within this timeframe. Forecaster 2's focus on the concrete legal risks (a 'crimes against humanity' probe) provides a more powerful deterrent to a voluntary return than I had previously factored in. My updated forecast of 15% reflects a revised view where a voluntary return is the only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome, and the probability of Hasina taking that immense risk is lower than I first thought. I am not moving lower, to the 13% of Forecaster 3, because I maintain that the return of a primary political rival creates a particularly volatile and personality-driven dynamic unique to Bangladeshi politics, which slightly elevates the chance of an unpredictable, politically-motivated move compared to a standard exile scenario.",
