  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "Companies typically hold their annual meetings on the date they publicly announce. However, the lack of an official SEC filing for GameStop makes the status quo one of significant uncertainty, with a high likelihood of the meeting occurring on a different date than June 12.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop's Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) is filed with the SEC and confirms a date other than June 12, 2025 for its annual meeting. Alternatively, the meeting is scheduled for June 12 but is postponed due to technical issues, similar to the 2024 meeting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop makes a late filing of its DEF 14A with the SEC, confirming the June 12, 2025 date. The company then proceeds to hold and complete its virtual annual meeting successfully on that day without any postponements.",
    "rationale": "The probability of GameStop's 2025 annual meeting taking place on June 12 is very low, primarily due to regulatory requirements. As of May 27, 2025, just 16 days before the proposed date, GameStop has not filed its Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) with the SEC. SEC rules generally require companies to send proxy materials or a notice of their availability at least 40 calendar days before a shareholder meeting. The failure to meet this deadline makes it procedurally almost impossible to hold the meeting on June 12. While some sources like Bloomberg terminals list June 12, this information is likely speculative or outdated, a conclusion supported by the fact that other sources show conflicting dates (e.g., Computershare listing June 2) or contain errors (the Business Insider dividend note). The historical pattern of holding meetings on a Thursday in June is consistent with the June 12 date, but this is weak evidence compared to the hard constraint of the missing SEC filing. Even if the regulatory hurdle were somehow cleared, the 2024 meeting's postponement due to server crashes introduces a secondary, non-trivial risk of failure. My forecast is not lower than 5% to account for the small possibility of an exception to SEC rules, a waiver, or an error in the available information about the filing's status. It is not higher because the missing regulatory filing is a critical, objective piece of evidence that strongly indicates the meeting will not happen on this specific date. I would update this forecast to be much higher if a DEF 14A confirming the June 12 date is filed immediately. Conversely, I would lower the forecast to near zero if a filing confirms a different date.",
