    "review": "Both forecasters add concrete details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: year‑end cash of roughly $0.23M, a going‑concern warning with explicit statements about insufficient liquidity, and that AquaBounty ceased fish farming in Dec 2024 and culled stock—implying minimal operating inflows now. Forecaster 3 also raises a plausible motivation for a Chapter 11 (a 363 sale to clear potential contractor liens tied to the Ohio facility). Forecaster 2’s point about very low leverage (D/E ~0.05) is an important counter: limited secured creditors often reduces the immediate need to file and preserves the option of out‑of‑court processes or small bridge financings. I find both analyses generally sound; the added facts on cash and halted operations increase near‑term hazard versus my prior. I’m less convinced by the >50% stance because low leverage and the short window make a delay via even modest bridge capital plausible, but I agree the probability should be higher than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "New information materially worsens the liquidity picture relative to my prior base: ~$0.23M cash at 12/31/24, operations largely shut, and management acknowledging insufficient liquidity. Absent fresh capital, the odds of running out of cash in Q2 and filing in June are non‑trivial, and a Chapter 11 to run a 363 sale of the Ohio asset is a realistic path. However, two factors temper the probability of a filing before July 1: (1) very low leverage reduces creditor‑driven urgency, allowing for out‑of‑court sales/deferrals; and (2) microcaps frequently secure last‑minute bridge financings or vendor forbearance that can extend runway by weeks, which is all that’s needed to push a filing past July 1. The fact we’re already at May 5 with no petition suggests they have either sourced some interim cash or are actively pursuing alternatives that could delay a filing. Balancing the heightened liquidity stress with the short time window and low leverage, I raise my forecast but stay below 50%.",
