    "review": "Both analyses are thoughtful and largely align with my initial framing. New/useful elements I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) the specific regulatory hook (8 C.F.R. 214.3) and the mismatch between SEVP’s compliance focus and the administration’s stated “campus climate/CCP” rationale; (2) the possibility of an administrative stay/conditional reinstatement as an additional off-ramp; (3) implementation timing concerns in SEVIS; and (4) potential exhaustion/administrative process defenses that could slow judicial relief. I find Forecaster 2’s emphasis on multiple off-ramps and the legal mismatch compelling, but I think 65% overweights the odds of quick administrative retreat and underweights appellate stay risk. Forecaster 3’s caution about national-security framing and exhaustion is reasonable, but I think 40% underweights courts’ propensity to grant emergency relief to preserve the status quo ante and the advantage Harvard gains from the short runway to July 1 (making a stay before that date less likely if relief comes late June).",
    "rationale": "Status quo is No after the May 22 revocation. The realistic paths to Yes by July 1 are: (1) emergency judicial relief restoring certification (TRO/PI) that is not stayed before July 1; (2) DHS/ICE administrative pause or negotiated conditional reinstatement. The legal posture likely favors Harvard at the injunction stage: large, immediate, irreparable harm to thousands of students; a plausible argument that DHS acted beyond SEVP’s remit or arbitrarily/capriciously; and a recent analogous episode (2020) where abrupt DHS action impacting international students was quickly halted. That supports a meaningful probability of a TRO/PI. Countervailing factors: DHS can frame the dispute as recordkeeping/national security noncompliance, which garners deference; the administration appears committed to escalation; and an appellate stay could arrive quickly if relief issues early. Implementation lag in SEVIS seems a manageable risk if a court orders immediate reinstatement. The short time window slightly favors Harvard on the July 1 criterion: a late-June TRO is less likely to be stayed before July 1. I therefore edge up my estimate modestly to reflect multiple off-ramps and timing dynamics, while still giving substantial weight to deference and stay risks.",
