    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial strategic dimension I underweighted: Zimbabwe's use of these payments as leverage for debt restructuring and international re-engagement. The February 2025 payment to foreign farmers that I missed establishes a stronger pattern than I recognized (two payments in ~2 months, not just one). However, their 65% probability seems optimistic given the 39-day window. Forecaster 3 provides critical operational details about the payment structure (1% cash, 99% bonds) and highlights implementation complexity evident in conflicting reports about recipient numbers. Their point about bond documentation/settlement mechanics is important but cuts both ways: if treasury bond allocation counts as 'payment,' the government could potentially satisfy the resolution criteria through bond issuance rather than cash disbursement, which might be administratively easier. Both forecasters offer more nuanced views than my initial analysis, which was too focused on economic constraints without adequately considering the geopolitical incentives or the bond mechanism.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from 35% based on three key factors: (1) The February 2025 payment I missed strengthens the pattern of active implementation beyond just April's payment, suggesting this is sustained policy not a one-off gesture. (2) Forecaster 2's geopolitical framing is compelling—these payments are high-impact diplomatic signals with modest fiscal cost, making them strategically valuable beyond the dollar amounts. (3) The bond allocation mechanism could enable a 'payment' more quickly than pure cash disbursement, though Forecaster 3 correctly notes setup complexity. However, I'm not moving to 65% because: the 39-day timeframe genuinely constrains execution; the administrative confusion (21 vs 378 recipients) signals implementation challenges; Zimbabwe's chronic capacity issues create execution risk; and after an initial symbolic payment, the urgency for a second payment before June 1 specifically may be lower than for sustained payments over 2025 generally. Balancing these considerations, I'm settling at 47%—higher than my initial forecast to account for the stronger pattern and strategic incentives, but below the midpoint to reflect real execution constraints in a compressed timeline.",
