    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 months (UFC 316 is likely in Oct/Nov 2025; outcome known on event night).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the most likely outcome is that this exact matchup does not occur at UFC 316.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is announced without Walker vs. Murzakanov on the card, or one withdraws, or they fight someone else.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC officially books Walker vs. Murzakanov at UFC 316, both make it to the cage, and Walker wins by KO/TKO/submission/decision.",
    "rationale": "Two conditions must both be met for a Yes: (1) Johnny Walker must fight Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316, and (2) Walker must win. The base rate for any specific pairing happening on a specific numbered card several months out is low due to matchmaking alternatives, timing, injuries, and withdrawals. Even if they are in the same division and a plausible pairing, there are many other top-15 options and cards they could land on. Therefore, the status quo heavily favors No.\n\nDecomposing: P(Yes) = P(the fight is on UFC 316) × P(Walker wins | the fight happens). Given current distance to the event and no confirmed booking information, I estimate roughly 10–15% that this exact fight ends up on UFC 316. Conditional on the fight happening, Walker’s win probability looks near coin-flip but slightly underdog versus Murzakanov’s compact power and durability versus Walker’s length, explosiveness, and volatility; I’d place Walker around 40–45% to win if they fight. Multiplying yields ~4–7% overall.\n\nWhy not higher: Most bouts that fans can imagine do not get scheduled on a specific PPV months in advance, and even scheduled bouts frequently change. Also, if booked, Walker may still be a slight underdog stylistically. Why not lower: The matchup is plausible within the division’s rankings and timeline, so there is a non-trivial chance UFC books it for a fall PPV, and Walker has clear win paths (range kicking, opportunistic counters, dynamic offense) if it occurs.\n\nWhat would move me up: An official UFC announcement of Walker vs. Murzakanov specifically for UFC 316; confirmed healthy camps and successful weigh-ins; market odds shortening toward Walker. What would move me down: Either fighter being booked against someone else around that timeframe, reports of injury/withdrawal, or line movement strongly favoring Murzakanov if the bout is booked.\n\nResearch assistant note: No additional information available; forecast relies on divisional context, typical UFC booking cadence, and matchup priors.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Johnny Walker defeat Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nPlease see [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/dab807a99d295832) for statistical details of the two opponents.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
