    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate and structural arguments: CDC rarely uses Level 3 for yellow fever, even during larger outbreaks; Level 3 would likely require sustained urban transmission and/or failure of mitigation; and the short window makes a policy change less likely. New/clarifying points I found useful: (1) explicit mention of fractional dosing as a backstop for vaccine supply (further reducing odds that mitigation fails), and (2) the dual requirement of an epidemiological step-change plus CDC action within the window. One minor quibble: the resolution text allows the check to occur on or after June 1, so a post–June 1 upgrade could still resolve Yes if the check happens later—though in practice Metaculus often checks on or close to the resolution date, so this likely has limited effect. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and slightly strengthens the case for a low single-digit probability.",
    "rationale": "My prior view: A Level 3 upgrade for yellow fever in Colombia by early June is unlikely given CDC precedent (Brazil 2017–18, Nigeria 2019 remained Level 2), existing mitigation (effective vaccine; Colombia’s mass campaign and entry requirements for certain travelers), current epidemiology (primarily rural/sylvatic transmission, no verified urban chains in major cities), and the short time horizon. The CDC also just issued a regional Level 2 notice in April 2025, making a rapid escalation less probable absent a clear deterioration.\n\nIn light of the other forecasters: I modestly lower my estimate. Their emphasis on fractional dosing and the need for both epidemiological escalation and CDC action within weeks further lowers the likelihood. The main upside risks remain: credible reports of sustained urban transmission in a major city (e.g., Cartagena, Medellín), multiple traveler/exported cases linked to urban centers, or significant vaccine access constraints for travelers. Downside (toward No) signals would be continued absence of urban transmission through mid-May, stable/declining incidence, and CDC/PAHO reaffirmations.\n\nNet: I trim my forecast slightly from 9% to 8% to reflect the reinforced base-rate case and mitigation capacity. I retain some probability mass for a rapid urban spillover scenario and swift CDC response, as well as the small chance the upgrade occurs shortly after June 1 and is captured at the time of check.",
