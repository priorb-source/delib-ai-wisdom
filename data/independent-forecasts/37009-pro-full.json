  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, April 21, 2025, Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite strong indications that she will run, Haley Stevens delays her formal announcement for strategic or personal reasons. The last week of April passes without an announcement, and the question resolves as 'No' on May 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following multiple media reports, Haley Stevens' campaign makes a formal announcement in the last week of April 2025, confirming her widely-expected candidacy for the US Senate in Michigan.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly suggests an announcement is imminent. Multiple credible news outlets, citing sources close to the campaign, have reported that an announcement is expected within days or weeks. More importantly, Stevens is taking concrete actions that are costly signals of her intent: she has raised significant funds ($1.6 million cash on hand), expanded her campaign staff, and has reportedly been contacting potential candidates to succeed her in her current House seat. These are not the actions of someone who is undecided; they are the preparatory steps for a major campaign launch. While the status quo is currently 'No,' the momentum is strongly toward 'Yes.'\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because political announcement timelines can be fluid. An unforeseen personal event or a last-minute strategic calculation could push the announcement into the first week of May, causing this specific question to resolve as 'No,' even if she does ultimately run. The phrase 'in the coming weeks' used by two outlets provides more ambiguity than Politico's 'as early as next week.'\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 90% because the combination of credible reporting and, more significantly, the costly preparatory actions she has already taken make a sudden reversal or significant delay highly improbable. Reaching out to potential successors for her House seat is a particularly strong signal that the decision to run has been made and the launch is in its final stages. A filing with the FEC or a media report confirming a specific announcement date before May 1 would increase my confidence. Conversely, a report of a snag in her campaign rollout or a major news event that could overshadow her announcement would cause me to lower the probability.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
