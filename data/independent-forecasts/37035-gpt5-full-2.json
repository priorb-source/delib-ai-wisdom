  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission remains primarily rural/sylvatic with no sustained urban spread in major cities; vaccination campaign scales up; PAHO risk assessment stays similar; CDC keeps a Level 2 notice for Colombia through June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid deterioration occurs: confirmed urban transmission in a major city (e.g., Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena), clear evidence of elevated risk to typical travelers that cannot be mitigated by vaccination (e.g., vaccine shortage or failure to meet demand), healthcare strain, and/or multiple travel-associated cases exported internationally. CDC upgrades Colombia’s Travel Health Notice to Level 3 or higher and it remains >2 on or after June 1.",
    "rationale": "I am using the resolution criterion that yields Yes if Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice is greater than Level 2 when checked on or after June 1, 2025. As of now, Colombia is Level 2 for yellow fever. The research assistant notes Colombia’s emergency declaration, 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since Sept 2024, a high-risk designation for 400+ municipalities, and a CDC regional Level 2 yellow fever notice (April 2025). Historically, CDC has not raised yellow fever outbreaks above Level 2 even during Brazil’s large 2017–18 outbreaks (>2,000 cases). Level 3 (“Reconsider travel”) is typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed systems, or risks that travelers cannot reasonably mitigate (e.g., no vaccination available). As of late April, cases are concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic and there are no verified urban transmissions in major cities. The time window is short (~5.5 weeks), and public health countermeasures (vaccination, entry requirements for certain travelers) are already in motion, which supports inertia at Level 2. Why not higher: A Level 3 upgrade for yellow fever would be historically unusual absent urban transmission or unmitigable traveler risk. No such signals have been reported, and PAHO’s regional numbers are modest relative to past outbreaks that did not trigger Level 3. Why not lower: The emergency declaration, elevated rural risk, and the possibility of under-ascertainment leave some chance of rapid escalation or confirmation of urban spread. What would move me up: Laboratory-confirmed urban transmission in a major city; PAHO/WHO elevating Colombia’s assessed risk to include likely urban outbreaks; evidence that vaccine supply or access becomes insufficient for travelers (i.e., mitigation fails); multiple exported cases to the U.S. or Europe attributable to travel in Colombia; CDC issuing intermediate updates signaling heightened concern. What would move me down: Continued absence of urban transmission by mid-May; stable or declining weekly cases; reports of effective vaccine rollout (including fractional dosing if needed); CDC reaffirmations of Level 2 or similar PAHO assessments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
