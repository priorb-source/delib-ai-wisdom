    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful framing: this is a streak problem where only one clean day is needed for “Yes,” making a daily per-day probability the key driver. Their weekend point is also relevant. However, their 94% assumed daily chance that at least one paper mentions tariffs is unsubstantiated; if WSJ’s A1 “What’s News” keeps using the exact word most days, that figure could be closer to 97–99%, which swings the streak math sharply toward “No.” Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes simultaneity and the unusually high salience of the tariff story, especially for WSJ, but leans heavily on the idea that high salience translates into near-daily A1 usage of the literal word. That may be true, but neither analysis provides hard observations on recent A1 wording frequency, and editorial salience doesn’t always equal using the exact term “tariff(s)” on A1 daily.\n\nNet: F2’s streak framing does increase my probability versus my prior, but I find their 75% high absent evidence that WSJ/NYT are omitting the literal word with regularity. F3’s 20% seems too low given 22 upcoming publication days and likely positive correlation (days quiet on tariffs could lead both to omit together).",
    "rationale": "I’m revising up slightly because my earlier reasoning implicitly treated a prior zero-success streak as evidence; that wasn’t established. The right frame is per-day chance of simultaneous omission over ~22 days. Key considerations now:\n\n- WSJ A1 risk: The WSJ “What’s News” box often includes ongoing macro/policy items and frequently uses “tariffs” explicitly; this pushes the daily probability that at least one paper mentions tariffs quite high. That’s my main brake on a high ‘Yes’ probability.\n- Correlation: When tariff news is quiet, both papers are more likely to omit the word on the same day. This positive correlation boosts the chance of at least one clean day versus an independence assumption.\n- Weekend effect and competing news: Weekends and potential major non-tariff events raise the odds of a clean day.\n\nBalancing these, I nudge my forecast up by 5 points (from 45% to 50%). I’m not higher because WSJ’s style and business focus plausibly keep the literal word on A1 most days. I’m not lower because we only need one clean day, and correlation plus weekends give multiple plausible windows.\n\nUpdate triggers: I would raise quickly if we see even one or two consecutive days where WSJ avoids the exact word on A1, or if a dominant non-trade story breaks. I would lower if there’s renewed tariff action (new EO details, enforcement steps, market disruptions) that predictably anchors A1 language, or evidence that WSJ’s “What’s News” is using “tariffs” virtually every day.",
