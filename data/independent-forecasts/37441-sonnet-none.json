    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks (from May 12 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the USD does not fall below 0.80 EUR",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USD stabilizes or strengthens against the EUR as tariff tensions ease, the Federal Reserve maintains relatively hawkish policy, or European economic weakness offsets dollar concerns. The market views the recent 3-year low as an oversold position and the dollar recovers or consolidates at current levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tariff turmoil escalates significantly, causing major disruptions to US trade and economic confidence. The USD continues its downward trajectory from the current 3-year low, potentially accelerated by negative economic data, policy missteps, or a flight from dollar assets. Currency markets overshoot to the downside, breaching the 0.80 threshold.",
    "rationale": "The background indicates the USD recently hit a 3-year low against the EUR amid tariff turmoil, suggesting we're starting from a position of dollar weakness. However, reaching 0.80 EUR per USD would represent an extremely weak dollar historically and would likely require substantial further depreciation of 5-10% or more depending on the current level. While the short 7-week window allows for volatility, several factors favor the status quo 'No' outcome: (1) Currency markets typically exhibit mean reversion, and such extreme moves usually require major crises rather than just policy uncertainty; (2) Central banks often intervene to prevent rapid, destabilizing currency movements; (3) The 0.80 level represents a psychological and technical barrier; (4) Without specific information about imminent catastrophic developments, betting on such an extreme outcome goes against base rates. The 'Yes' case relies on the existing weakness continuing and accelerating, which is possible given the tariff turmoil context and the fact that FX markets can overshoot. However, absent clear evidence of an impending crisis or trajectory toward this specific threshold, the base rate of stability suggests this extreme outcome is unlikely. My forecast would be higher if there were signs of imminent policy disasters, major economic data deterioration, or the current rate were already very close to 0.80. It would be lower if we had evidence of stabilization measures or if the timeframe were longer, allowing more time for mean reversion.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
