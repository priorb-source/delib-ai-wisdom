    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same conclusion (35%) through nearly identical reasoning, which increases my confidence in our shared assessment. We all identified the central tension between the strong inertia of the status quo favoring a 'No' outcome and the single, potent piece of intelligence from the Israeli media report suggesting a 'Yes' is plausible. Two points raised by my peers were particularly useful refinements. Forecaster 2 noted the possibility that the leak could be a deliberate act of sabotage, intended to derail secret talks. Forecaster 3 highlighted the second-hand nature of the report (media reporting on a ministerial briefing about a third-party negotiation), which introduces potential for misinterpretation. Both arguments provide strong, specific reasons for the uncertainty I had already factored in, reinforcing the decision not to raise my forecast higher based on a single source.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 35%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial analysis rather than altering it. The consensus among all three forecasters suggests that 35% represents a reasonable balance given the limited and conflicting evidence. My reasoning remains anchored in the opposition between two powerful factors: 1) The extremely short timeline of approximately six weeks, making a complex international agreement highly improbable under normal circumstances. 2) The credible, specific intelligence report of a high-level Israeli briefing on the 'high chance' of a deal, which suggests the process is far more advanced than publicly known. The points raised by my colleagues about the leak potentially being an act of sabotage or the information being second-hand serve to strengthen the rationale for keeping the forecast well below 50%. While the Israeli report is a significant signal that prevents me from forecasting a near-zero probability, these counterarguments confirm that raising the forecast further would be premature and would underweight the substantial obstacles that remain.",
