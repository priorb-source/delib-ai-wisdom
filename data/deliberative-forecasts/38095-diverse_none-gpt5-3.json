    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful early-term base-rate lens (Trump’s first-term pattern of sparse early-month clemencies and not exceeding 2 for a while). That slightly pushes against a June batch. Forecaster 3’s 237 total (≈5/month) is accurate but misleading for a month-level forecast because of extreme end-term clustering; the average inflates expectations for a typical mid-year month. Both correctly note the low threshold (3+) and Trump’s willingness to grant controversial clemencies, which keeps the probability materially above a very low base rate. Neither presents concrete June-specific signals (leaks, scheduling, or planned themes) that would materially move the odds. The mention of increased second-term activity (white-collar focus) from the background supports some upward pressure but lacks timing specificity for June.",
    "rationale": "My prior weighed: (1) base rates favor months with ≤2 grants; (2) Trump’s unconstrained posture and the low bar make 3+ plausible at any time; (3) June lacks obvious batch triggers versus July 4 or year-end; (4) blanket/cluster actions could clear the bar abruptly; (5) no credible reporting of a June slate. Forecaster 2’s early-term caution is a valid nudge downward; Forecaster 3’s use of term-average is not persuasive for June specifically. The Guardian context implies some 2025 activity but doesn’t anchor to June. Net effect: the competing nudges largely offset. Without new, June-specific signals, I keep a moderately elevated but sub-coin-flip stance. I would move up on credible reports of a pending June batch or blanket action (e.g., Jan 6 cases); I’d move down if early June is quiet and reporting points to July 4 or later timing.",
