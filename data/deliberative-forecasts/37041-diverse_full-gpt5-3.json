    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize status-quo inertia over a ~5-week window and the multi-step chain needed for a CDC country-specific Travel Health Notice (local transmission, detection, and CDC action). They also stress Panama’s long absence of cases, high vaccination in risk areas, and recent preventive measures (also Costa Rica’s). Forecaster 3 highlights base rates and that CDC notices target sustained traveler risk. I agree with the time-constraint argument and that regional (South America-wide) alerts don’t satisfy the question’s country-level criterion. One nuance I’d add: CDC has sometimes issued Level 1 notices with limited confirmed local transmission or notable epizootics, so a single detected North American spillover could be enough—but that still requires detection and publication within the short window. I find their reasoning broadly convincing and slightly temper my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "The question resolves Yes only if a North American country appears on the CDC Travel Health Notices page for yellow fever on/after June 1, 2025. As of late April, increased transmission is in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia; the Colombian hotspots (Tolima, Putumayo) are not adjacent to Panama. North American countries have prevention measures in place (Panama’s high-risk area vaccination, Costa Rica’s entry vaccine requirement), and there have been no recent human cases reported in North America. For a Yes outcome, there would need to be local sylvatic or urban transmission detected in a North American country and then a CDC notice posted—all within ~5 weeks. While elevated South American activity marginally raises spillover risk and the presence of competent vectors in Central America keeps the door open, the short timeline and absence of early indicators (e.g., NHP die-offs or suspected local cases in Panama/Costa Rica) argue for a low probability. I’m trimming my forecast slightly to reflect the short window and geographic concentration of current cases away from the Darién region. I would move higher on credible reports of local human cases or significant epizootics in Panama/Costa Rica or PAHO alerts specific to Central America; I would move lower if case growth in South America clearly slows without any northward indications by mid-May.",
