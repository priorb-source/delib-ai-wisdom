    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened two points I underweighted: (1) FlightsFrom typically reflects the current IATA season, so United’s NRT–ROR starting Oct 29 (W25/26) is unlikely to be listed on July 1 during S25; counting on it to appear by early July was optimistic. (2) The Qantas Brisbane–Koror claim is atypical for Qantas and lacks corroboration; discounting it reduces the plausible path to 6. They also rightly stress that Metaculus will likely check near July 1, reducing the chance that late-summer filings inflate the count. Uncertainty around whether Manila and Yap are simultaneously filed as nonstops is another key constraint I hadn’t sufficiently emphasized. Overall, their logic that getting to 6 requires multiple independent positives in a small, still-recovering market is convincing, especially on the timing/listing mechanics.",
    "rationale": "Reframing with the seasonal-listing and verification hurdles: To reach >5 (i.e., ≥6) destinations on July 1, you probably need most of the following simultaneously listed on FlightsFrom: Guam (UA) and Taipei (CI) as the core; Manila and Yap both filed as true nonstops; plus at least one more scheduled destination (Korea or Hong Kong), or a validated Brisbane service. The announced United Narita route likely won’t contribute on July 1 due to being a W25/26 start. JAL charters don’t count. Korean/Hong Kong resumptions as scheduled services by early July are possible but not evidenced. If Brisbane doesn’t exist as a scheduled Qantas service (as seems likely), then hitting 6 requires two incremental scheduled resumptions beyond GUM/TPE and at least one of MNL/YAP—an implausible stack given the market’s recovery pace. I’m therefore reducing my probability substantially. I’d move up again only with verified GDS/OAG listings visible on FlightsFrom by late June for at least two among ICN/HKG/BNE, plus confirmation that both MNL and YAP are simultaneously listed as nonstops.",
