    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had not sufficiently weighted. Forecaster 2's contextualization of Level 4 advisories—noting only 21 countries worldwide hold this status and comparing Mozambique to nations like Syria and Yemen—effectively highlights the extremely high bar for such a designation. This base rate information is crucial. Forecaster 3's point about the State Department's historical pattern of applying targeted, sub-national 'Do Not Travel' warnings specifically to Mozambique's northern provinces, rather than issuing a blanket nationwide advisory, is a powerful argument. This suggests a strong institutional precedent that would require an unprecedented country-wide crisis to overcome. Both analyses convincingly argue that while Mozambique's security situation is deteriorating, it does not currently approach the threshold of state collapse or pervasive, nationwide conflict typically required for a Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial 20% estimate over-indexed on the recent negative security trends—the expansion of the insurgency and the post-election protests—without sufficiently anchoring on the structural rarity of a nationwide Level 4 advisory. The base rate data and the historical context for Mozambique, as articulated by the other forecasters, are highly persuasive. The State Department has a clear pattern of using regional warnings for Mozambique, and a shift to a blanket Level 4 advisory in the next eight weeks would require a catastrophic and rapid escalation far beyond the current trajectory. I am reducing my forecast from 20% to 10%. I am not lowering it further, to the level of Forecaster 3's 7%, because the confluence of a spreading insurgency and significant political unrest creates a volatile environment where a rapid deterioration, while unlikely, remains a non-trivial tail risk. The 10% probability acknowledges that the situation is more unstable than it has been in the recent past, while giving significant weight to the very high threshold for a Level 4 designation.",
