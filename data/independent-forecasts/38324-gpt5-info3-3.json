  "information": "The federal budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, is projected to be $2.2 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican-proposed bill to cut taxes and eliminate certain programs would add an additional $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Interest payments on the debt have become one of the largest federal expenses, exceeding defense spending and projected to surpass $1 trillion annually. According to the Treasury Department, net interest expenditure for the first seven months of the 2025 fiscal year totaled $578.7 billion. In 2025, $9.2 trillion of existing U.S. debt is scheduled to mature, with $6.5 trillion of that amount coming due between January and June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (until June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — debt remains below $37T by June 27 on the current trajectory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Normal monthly borrowing continues, June corporate tax receipts reduce net issuance mid-month, and there is no unusually large late‑June cash-balance rebuild; total public debt stays in the mid–$36T range and does not reach $37T by June 27.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Debt is already very close to $37T (e.g., ≥$36.85T) in early/mid‑June and Treasury executes an unusually large late‑June bill issuance to rebuild the Treasury General Account, pushing total debt over $37T by or just after June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and trend: Over the past couple of years, debt has risen roughly $2–3T/year (~$170–250B/month). With only 23 days left, reaching $37T would require the current level to already be very near that mark or an unusually large burst of net issuance in June.\n- Timing effects: June often has corporate/estimated tax receipts around mid‑month, which typically reduce net borrowing needs and can temporarily slow the rise in debt. That favors a No outcome by the 27th.\n- Research assistant inputs considered: FY2025 deficit projected at ~$2.2T suggests an average monthly run rate around ~$180B. Net interest is large but already part of the deficit math. The $6.5T in maturities Jan–Jun 2025 are mostly rollovers and do not, by themselves, increase total debt. None of these imply a sudden multi‑hundred‑billion spike in late June.\n- Why not higher (i.e., why not more likely Yes): With only three weeks left, crossing $37T requires either starting within ~$100–200B of the threshold or engineering an unusually large late‑June cash-balance build. Typical month‑end cash management and mid‑June receipts make a very large late‑June net increase less likely.\n- Why not lower (i.e., why not near-zero Yes probability): There is uncertainty about the exact current level. If total debt is already within a couple hundred billion of $37T, a moderate TGA rebuild or heavier‑than‑usual bill issuance could tip it over before June 27. End‑of‑quarter cash management can sometimes be sizable.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Upward: Daily Debt to the Penny readings show total debt ≥$36.85T by mid‑June; Treasury signals an end‑June TGA rebuild of >$200B; unexpectedly weak receipts or large supplemental outlays.\n  • Downward: Debt readings remain ≤$36.6T after mid‑June; stronger‑than‑expected tax inflows; any constraints (formal or practical) limiting net issuance.\nNote: The provided FRED link on merchant wholesalers’ inventories/sales ratio is not relevant to debt dynamics and was not used.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
