    "review": "My initial forecast of 88% was higher than that of my colleagues (80% and 77%). Their analyses were compelling in highlighting factors I had perhaps underweighted. Specifically, they both emphasized the clear trend of Zohran Mamdani's momentum, noting his rise from low double-digits to 23% in the most recent poll. While I was aware of this, they correctly framed it as an active and ongoing trend that could continue into election day. Forecaster 3's framing of the ranked-choice voting risk as a mechanism for an 'anti-Cuomo consolidation' was particularly insightful. It's not just random uncertainty; it's a specific dynamic where Cuomo's high negatives could cause voters for the other seven candidates to strategically rank Mamdani second, creating a plausible, if narrow, path to an upset. I found this reasoning convincing and agree that I had not sufficiently priced in this specific risk.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 88% to 83%. I maintain that Andrew Cuomo remains the prohibitive favorite to win the primary. The evidence for this is strong and consistent: a durable, double-digit lead across multiple polls for three months; a significant financial and institutional advantage; and key endorsements from historically reliable voting blocs. The Marist poll's ranked-choice voting (RCV) simulation, which showed him winning, remains a critical piece of evidence against an upset. \n\nHowever, the other forecasters convinced me that my initial 88% was too confident. I have updated my forecast downward by 5 points to better account for two key risks. First is Zohran Mamdani's clear momentum. The polling gap has demonstrably narrowed, and with two weeks remaining, that trend creates more uncertainty than I had initially modeled. Second, as my colleagues articulated, Cuomo's polarizing history makes him uniquely vulnerable in an RCV system. There is a significant chance that supporters of the other seven candidates will consolidate behind Mamdani in subsequent rounds in an explicit 'anybody-but-Cuomo' fashion. While Cuomo's lead is likely large enough to withstand this, the risk is more substantial than the 12% I had originally assigned. My revised forecast of 83% still reflects that Cuomo is very likely to win, but it now incorporates a greater probability of a late surge from Mamdani amplified by the dynamics of ranked-choice voting.",
