  "information": "Prominent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues building/filing his new party and teasing a potential bid but holds off on a formal candidacy announcement until later in 2025 or 2026; he may launch the party or an exploratory effort without declaring he’s running.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan publicly declares “I’m running for governor” via press event, social media, or official filing accompanied by a public statement before July 1, leveraging media attention to recruit and fundraise for his new party.",
    "rationale": "Short timeline favors the status quo. Florida’s 2026 gubernatorial cycle doesn’t require a June 2025 declaration, so there’s no hard deadline pressuring an announcement this month. Morgan has a history of flirting with runs and then holding off, which nudges the base rate toward No over a short window. The research assistant notes he’s been working for months on a new centrist party (reported in Feb/May 2025) with lawyers preparing paperwork and names floated (“Capitalist Party” or “#ForThePeople”). That’s a meaningful signal of seriousness and infrastructure-building, which lifts the probability above a very low baseline. Still, forming and certifying a new party and setting up campaign mechanics are complex; he may prefer to finalize party recognition, staffing, and messaging before formally declaring, and he can do that later in 2025. Why not higher: there’s no immediate external deadline, Morgan’s prior pattern of backing away, and the complexity of launching a third-party effort all reduce the likelihood of a declaration in the next ~3 weeks. Why not lower: the Politico blueprint, months of prep, and Morgan’s ability to self-fund and love of media attention make a June splash plausible, especially if party papers are ready and he wants to use an early announcement to drive recruitment and fundraising. What would move me up: credible reports of a scheduled announcement/press event in June; filings of candidate paperwork or opening a campaign account tied to a public statement; confirmation that the new party has been formally recognized by the state and is rolling out leadership, staff, and branding; hints from Morgan that a decision is imminent with a defined date. What would move me down: public indications he’s delaying the decision to late summer/fall; setbacks in party recognition; statements emphasizing party-building over a personal run; or endorsements of another prospective candidate.",
