    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base reasoning: strong neutrality norms for acting presidents (with Hwang Kyo-ahn 2017 as the closest precedent), Han’s technocratic/elder statesman profile, and the practical frictions of resigning and assembling a campaign in a compressed window. They also emphasize that if a June election is indeed imminent, any viable Han run would almost have to surface by early May, making the event we’re forecasting (pre–May 5 announcement) essentially coincident with the decision to run. That framing slightly strengthens the case for a pre–May 5 announcement versus a later one. However, neither provides new concrete evidence of organizational moves, elite coordination, or formal draft steps beyond the cited headline. I find their reasoning sound and well-calibrated; the main incremental insight is the tighter coupling of timelines to our cutoff date, which nudges probability up modestly.",
    "rationale": "My base view: absent visible preparatory signals (campaign staff formation, formal PPP draft moves, resignation chatter, or explicit openness from Han), the default is No. Acting presidents in Korea face strong expectations of neutrality, and Han’s age/profile and the PPP’s alternative bench make a last-minute candidacy less likely. The Yes path requires rapid elite coalescence and an immediate announcement to meet party and legal timelines for a June vote. The other forecasters’ emphasis that the decision window effectively coincides with our cutoff makes a pre–May 5 announcement the natural focal point if it happens at all. That slightly increases the odds that, if he does run, we’d see it by our date. Still, with no corroborating reports of concrete steps, I maintain a No-leaning view with a non-trivial tail. I’m nudging my estimate up a bit to reflect the tight calendar dynamics but not changing it materially due to the lack of evidence of real movement.",
