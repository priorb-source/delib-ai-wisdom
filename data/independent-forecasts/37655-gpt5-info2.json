  "information": "President Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement; the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force and is extended again; no Verkhovna Rada resolution is introduced or passed to set a presidential election date; the President and government continue to signal elections will be considered only after the security situation improves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political decision is made to reassure domestic and international audiences: the Verkhovna Rada adopts a resolution setting a specific presidential election date (likely late 2025 or 2026), possibly contingent on lifting martial law, and this is publicly announced by authorized bodies.",
    "rationale": "- Legal/institutional baseline: Under Ukraine’s current legal framework, nationwide elections are not held during martial law. The authority to set a presidential election date lies with the Verkhovna Rada. Announcing a date would therefore require a clear political shift and parliamentary action. Historically during the full-scale invasion, Kyiv has repeatedly extended martial law and deferred elections.\n- Recent signals: According to the research assistant, the President’s Office explicitly denied reports of planning a July 2025 election and called them manipulative. Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of elections is only for after the war or major hostilities subside. That strongly supports a No outcome in the next 6 weeks.\n- Strategic incentives: There is some non-zero chance of a surprise announcement to bolster legitimacy or satisfy partners, especially if framed as a future date conditional on security improvements or legal changes. However, doing so while the front is active and conditions are uncertain would carry risks of later postponement and political cost. With fighting ongoing and mobilization priorities prominent, the status quo strongly points to no near-term announcement.\n- Why not higher: Legal and political hurdles (martial law, need for Rada action), current war dynamics, and clear denials from the President’s Office all weigh against an announcement before July 1.\n- Why not lower: It is conceivable that Kyiv announces a future date to provide a governance roadmap, or advances a legal change enabling elections under certain conditions. A sudden stabilization or diplomatic development could also prompt an announcement.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a draft Rada resolution to set a date; Zelensky or the Speaker signaling intent to schedule the election in 2025/early 2026; public Western pressure tied to a specific timeline; indications of pausing or ending martial law.\n- What would move me down: Another firm public denial coupled with a fresh extension of martial law into late 2025; no parliamentary activity on election law; deteriorating security conditions that make even planning implausible.\nOverall, given the short window and strong status quo inertia, a No remains likeliest.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
