    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the Elections Alberta verification process taking weeks to months is critical - this is a bureaucratic bottleneck I underweighted. Even if signatures are gathered rapidly, verification is a separate constraint that likely extends beyond the 55-day window. The mention of unverified claims of rapid signature gathering (80,000 in 36 hours) is interesting but doesn't overcome the verification timeline issue. Forecaster 3's political science analysis is particularly persuasive: sovereigntist rhetoric has functioned as leverage against Ottawa rather than genuine preparation for separation. The point about First Nations treaty rights with the federal Crown adds a significant legal/political complication I had not considered. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that polling shows independence support well below winning threshold, making it politically irrational for Smith to schedule a referendum she would likely lose. The gap between my 10% and their 6% and 2% forecasts suggests I was too generous to tail risks given the very short timeline and strong political disincentives.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward for several reasons: (1) The Elections Alberta verification process represents a significant time bottleneck I underweighted - weeks to months of verification likely exceeds the 55-day window even if signatures are submitted immediately; (2) The political costs are higher than I initially assessed, particularly given First Nations opposition and polling showing independence support below winning threshold; (3) The interpretation that sovereigntist rhetoric serves as federal leverage rather than genuine separatist preparation is convincing and better explains Smith's actual political behavior; (4) The 55-day timeline is exceptionally short for such a momentous political decision. However, I'm not going as low as 2% because: (1) The question only requires announcing a date, not holding the referendum - the government could theoretically announce a 2026 date before July 1, 2025; (2) Some political uncertainty remains around unforeseen federal-provincial conflicts; (3) The government could bypass the petition process entirely, though this would be highly unusual. I'm settling on 6% as the most defensible forecast that respects the strong status quo bias while maintaining a small probability for tail risks.",
