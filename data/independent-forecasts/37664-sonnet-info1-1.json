  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues development and testing of Claude 4 but does not announce or release it before July 1, 2025. The company may be taking a more cautious approach, extending internal testing, or delaying release for competitive/strategic reasons. They might also be focusing on incremental Claude 3.x improvements rather than a major version jump.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces Claude 4 within the next 6 weeks and makes it available to the general public immediately or within 48 hours, consistent with their historical release pattern. The model has been ready internally and the company decides to launch it before the end of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since Claude 4 has not yet been released with only 46 days remaining. According to the research assistant's report, Claude release gaps have been increasing: 5 months between versions 1 and 2, then 8 months between versions 2 and 3. Claude 3 was released in March 2024, making it currently 14 months old - well beyond the historical 5-8 month pattern. If Anthropic were following their previous cadence (even with increasing gaps), we would have expected Claude 4 around January-March 2025. The fact that we're in mid-May with no announcement suggests either a significantly extended development cycle or a strategic decision to delay. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) Anthropic has demonstrated rapid public availability (within 48 hours) after announcement, so a late-June announcement could still satisfy the criteria; (2) major AI labs can surprise the market with sudden releases; (3) 46 days provides a reasonable window for an announcement. The probability is not higher because we lack any public signals of imminent release, and major model launches typically generate advance buzz. Each passing day without news progressively reduces the likelihood. I would update higher if credible leaks, Anthropic statements, or industry rumors emerge about Claude 4, and would update lower as we approach July 1 without developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
