    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror the base-rate framing I used: ~38% U.S. share in the 200–300 band, recent snapshots non-U.S., and a modest downtrend in U.S. representation. Forecaster 2 adds a reasonable point about modest persistence over a one-month horizon and de-emphasizes the seasonality claim. Forecaster 3 highlights the July 1 timing being at the cusp of Q3 (so any Q1–Q2 seasonal weakness wouldn’t strongly help U.S.), and emphasizes the dense clustering and day-to-day churn near #250. Neither introduced decisive new data, but both make a slightly stronger case for modest persistence of the non-U.S. status quo and give practical update triggers I agree with.",
    "rationale": "My prior 38% leaned on the cross-sectional base rate, tempered by current non-U.S. occupancy and a declining U.S. share. The others’ arguments nudge me to weight near-term persistence a bit more and treat the alleged seasonality as weak evidence for this date. With roughly a month left, daily volatility keeps a U.S. flip plausible, but the trend and immediate status quo justify shading slightly below the 38% base rate. I’m trimming 2 points to reflect that tilt without overreacting in the absence of new structural information. I would move up if late-June USD strength or U.S. equity outperformance pushes multiple U.S. names into the 248–252 range; I would move down if a non-U.S. cluster remains around that band or if USD weakens/commodities rally into July 1.",
