    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis is based on a false premise. They analyze the fight matchup as if it were still scheduled, completely ignoring the research provided which states Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the fight. This makes their entire rationale and 35% forecast invalid as it fails to address the most critical piece of information affecting the resolution. Forecaster 3, however, provides an excellent analysis. Their reasoning aligns perfectly with my own initial assessment: the fight is cancelled, and according to the resolution criteria, this resolves as 'No'. Their key contribution, which I find convincing, is assigning a 1% probability instead of 0% to account for the remote but non-zero possibility of an unprecedented turn of events where the fight is re-booked. This is a sound forecasting practice that accounts for extreme tail risk.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 0%, based on the definitive reports of Johnny Walker's withdrawal and replacement. The resolution criteria are explicit: if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, the question resolves as 'No'. The current facts support this outcome entirely. However, after reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I am persuaded by Forecaster 3's argument for a small, non-zero probability. While a 'Yes' outcome is exceptionally unlikely, it is not a logical impossibility. For a 'Yes' to occur, the multiple reports of the cancellation would have to be reversed, the new opponent would have to be removed, the original fight would need to be reinstated on the same card, and then Walker would have to win. This chain of events is highly improbable, but forecasting best practices advise against assigning 0% to events that are not strictly impossible. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 0% to 1% to reflect this minuscule chance of a complete reversal of the current situation. My confidence in a 'No' resolution remains extremely high.",
