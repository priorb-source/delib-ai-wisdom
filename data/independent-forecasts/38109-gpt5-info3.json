  "information": "June is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes: Kalshi continues its current practice of listing MLB game markets and posts at least one MLB game market every calendar day in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any single day in June 2025 passes without a listed real-money market on an MLB game (e.g., a site/ops outage, a day they skip posting, or a regulatory-driven suspension of sports/event markets).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi keeps the baseball tag live and reliably posts at least one MLB game market each day in June, including light-slate days, with no interruptions from tech, ops, or regulators.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline conditions are favorable: June is within the MLB regular season and, per the assistant’s note, MLB games are scheduled essentially every day, so supply of games is not the constraint. The provided Kalshi link suggests an active baseball tag, implying current intent/capability to list such markets. \n- Status-quo inertia: If Kalshi is already offering daily MLB markets by late May, the most likely outcome is continuation into June. Operationally, a professional exchange can schedule and automate listings, making daily coverage feasible. \n- Key risks that make this fragile: (1) The criterion is all-days; a single missed day flips the resolution to No. Even small probabilities of operational misses or short outages compound over 30 days. (2) Regulatory overhang: The CFTC’s evolving stance on event contracts (including potential restrictions on “gaming” categories) adds tail risk of a pause or removal of sports markets. The referenced court activity around Kalshi’s event contracts (albeit focused on elections) underscores a non-zero chance of compliance-driven changes that could spill over or cause temporary suspensions. \n- Why not higher: The “every day” requirement is stringent; even a 1–2% daily miss probability materially lowers month-long success odds. Add a modest chance of regulatory turbulence in June, and the path to a clean 30-for-30 month is not trivial. \n- Why not lower: If Kalshi is currently listing MLB markets, operational continuity and automation likely keep the per-day success probability high. MLB’s dense June schedule makes it easy to satisfy the “at least one game” condition daily. \n- What would move me up: Seeing the first week of June with flawless daily MLB listings; explicit confirmation from Kalshi that sports markets will remain available; absence of any new CFTC action or exchange notices. \n- What would move me down: Any early-June day missed; signs of regulatory intervention or policy changes affecting event/sports markets; removal or de-emphasis of the baseball category; notable site outages.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
