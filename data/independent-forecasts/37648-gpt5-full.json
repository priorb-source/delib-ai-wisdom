  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks in Oman and with the E3 continue into June without bridging core gaps (Iran refuses dismantlement/zero stockpile; the US insists on maximalist terms). The White House adds sanctions to maintain pressure; Iran keeps enrichment at 60% and signals flexibility only on its 60% stockpile. Without a mutually acceptable package and no politically sellable concessions on either side, there is no joint announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A face‑saving interim or framework agreement is announced: Iran agrees to ship out or blend down its 60% stockpile, cap enrichment at lower levels under tighter IAEA monitoring, and pause advanced centrifuge installation; the US offers targeted sanctions relief (e.g., oil export waivers or access to funds) and verification steps. Both sides present it as a strong, time‑bound “understanding,” counting as an agreement announcement before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short and the positions described remain far apart. According to the assistant’s report, Iran says it will never build nuclear weapons, is willing to eliminate its highly enriched (60%) stockpile, and cap enrichment at civilian levels under oversight, but rejects dismantling its program. The US has laid out 14 non‑negotiable red lines, reportedly including removal of all enriched uranium, dismantling centrifuges, and no sunset clauses—terms Tehran has treated as red lines of its own. While both sides call the Oman‑mediated rounds “constructive,” that rhetoric is common and often precedes slippage. A fifth round is planned, but compressing a verifiable, politically durable deal into the next six weeks is difficult. That said, the bar for resolution is only that they sign or announce an agreement “with respect to” the nuclear program; a narrow interim or framework deal could qualify. Signals in the background—Israeli media hinting at a high chance, repeated rounds in Muscat/Rome, and claims of converging positions—nudge the odds up from very low. However, recent US sanctions, Iran’s rejection of dismantlement, and domestic optics for a Trump administration seeking a “strong” agreement all push against a quick breakthrough. Why not higher: Core incompatibilities (zero enriched uranium and dismantlement vs. Iran’s civilian program red line), limited time, and a history of near‑deals falling apart. Why not lower: Active, ongoing rounds; explicit Iranian willingness to roll back 60% stockpile and accept tighter oversight; the possibility of an interim framework that both sides can market as tough/safe. What would raise my forecast: credible reporting of a draft text with agreed verification steps; US softening on total removal/dismantlement; clear offers of targeted sanctions relief; IAEA engagement signaling imminent agreement; scheduling of a ministerial‑level announcement. What would lower it: new US/EU sanctions tranches; Iranian escalation (beyond 60% or new centrifuge cascades); public statements that talks stalled; regional escalation derailing diplomacy.",
