    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The FATF Plenary is in June 2025, and the results are typically published at its conclusion.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF June 2025 plenary concludes without any additions to or removals from the 'black list'. The FATF assesses that the severe deficiencies in North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar persist, and that no 'grey-listed' jurisdiction's lack of progress warrants an escalation to the black list at this time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF adds a new jurisdiction to the 'black list'. This would most likely be a country currently on the 'grey list' that the FATF determines is not making sufficient progress on its action plan or is actively refusing to address its strategic AML/CFT deficiencies. A removal from the list is an alternative but far less likely path to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of inertia associated with the FATF's 'black list'. Changes, particularly removals, are rare and require substantial, verifiable, and politically supported improvements in a country's financial oversight regime. The research assistant provided no specific information, so my forecast relies heavily on the status quo and historical base rates.\n\nStatus Quo (No Change) is the most likely outcome:\n1.  **Removals are highly improbable:** North Korea and Iran are long-term fixtures on the list due to deep-seated geopolitical issues and a lack of engagement with FATF standards. Their removal is not a credible short-term possibility. Myanmar was added in October 2022 amidst significant political instability and civil conflict, making it extremely unlikely that it has implemented the necessary reforms to be delisted so soon.\n2.  **Additions are a high bar:** Escalating a country from the 'grey list' (Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring) to the 'black list' is a significant step that the FATF takes as a last resort. It signifies a complete breakdown in cooperation or a severe lack of political will to implement reforms. While this is the most plausible route to a 'Yes' outcome, it is not a frequent occurrence.\n\nWhy the probability is not lower (i.e., why 'Yes' is still possible):\nThe primary risk of a 'Yes' outcome comes from a potential addition. A grey-listed country facing severe internal turmoil or making a political decision to cease cooperation with the FATF could be escalated. The global geopolitical environment remains volatile, which could trigger a rapid deterioration in a specific country's AML/CFT situation, forcing the FATF's hand.\n\nWhy the probability is not higher:\nThe black list's stability is its defining feature. Most countries on the grey list are actively working with the FATF to be delisted, and the process, while often slow, typically avoids escalation. Without specific intelligence pointing to a particular grey-listed country's imminent failure to meet its commitments, the base rate overwhelmingly favors no change at any single plenary meeting.\n\nI would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if credible reports emerged before the plenary indicating that a specific grey-listed country had demonstrably failed to meet key deadlines or that the FATF was formally considering its escalation. I would decrease it if pre-plenary reports emphasized progress among key grey-listed countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
