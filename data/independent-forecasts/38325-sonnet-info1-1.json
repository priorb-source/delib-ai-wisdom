  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released around the last week of June, roughly one month after the second estimate which came out on May 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The second estimate shows Q1 2025 real GDP at -0.2% annualized growth, which is negative. If this persists or remains non-positive in the third estimate, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate maintains or shows further contraction, with real GDP growth remaining at or below 0.0%. Additional data incorporated in the third estimate confirms that imports continued to be a major drag on GDP (the -4.90 pp contribution holds or worsens), and other components don't improve enough to offset the negative factors. The economy contracted in Q1 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate is revised significantly upward to show positive growth (>0.0%). This would require an upward revision of at least 0.2 percentage points from the second estimate. More complete source data reveals stronger consumer spending than initially measured, lower import impacts, or stronger contributions from investment or other components that push the final figure into positive territory.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate showed -0.3% growth, which was revised upward to -0.2% in the second estimate - an improvement of 0.1 percentage point. This upward revision trend is encouraging, but to achieve a Yes outcome, we would need the third estimate to show at least 0.1% growth (preferably more to clearly exceed 0.0%), requiring an additional upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points from the current -0.2%. While third estimates do incorporate more complete source data and can show meaningful revisions, such a large swing from negative to positive territory between second and third estimates is relatively uncommon. The magnitude of negative drags noted in the research (imports subtracting 4.90 pp) suggests fundamental weakness that may be difficult to fully reverse with data refinements. However, the consistent upward revision pattern and the fact that we're only marginally in negative territory means a flip to positive is plausible but not highly likely. My forecast is not higher because we need a fairly substantial revision (0.3+ pp) which is larger than typical third estimate adjustments. It's not lower because we've already seen upward momentum in revisions and are close to the zero threshold. I would update higher if I saw evidence of systematic underestimation in earlier GDP components or news of particularly strong late-quarter economic data. I would update lower if revised trade data confirmed the large import drag.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
