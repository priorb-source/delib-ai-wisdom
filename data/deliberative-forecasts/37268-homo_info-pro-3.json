    "review": "The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, introduced a crucial and decisive piece of new information: the Independent High Electoral Commission's (IHEC) deadline for registering political alliances is May 4, 2025. Given that today is May 3, this logistical constraint fundamentally invalidates the core of my initial reasoning, which relied heavily on Sadr's historical precedent for late-stage reversals (e.g., two months before the 2021 election). That precedent is irrelevant if the procedural door closes tomorrow. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 made convincing arguments that Sadr's current, consistent, and public reaffirmation of the boycott should be weighted far more heavily. I had underestimated the inertia of his current position and the political capital he would lose by reversing at the eleventh hour without any apparent concessions from his rivals. Their reasoning, grounded in the immediate logistical realities and Sadr's current rhetoric, is far more compelling than my more historically-based initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 65% to 10%. The primary reason for this dramatic change is the IHEC's May 4 registration deadline, as highlighted by Forecaster 3. This hard deadline makes a formal announcement of participation by the Alliance Towards Reforms extremely unlikely within the required timeframe for this question. My initial analysis was flawed by its failure to account for this critical logistical constraint. The arguments from both other forecasters have convinced me to give much greater weight to Sadr's current public stance over his past behavior. The context of his 2022 mass resignation from parliament makes this boycott qualitatively different from previous ones. A reversal now, just before the registration deadline, would require a major, unforeseen political catalyst, of which there is no sign. I am not updating to 5% because I maintain that Sadr's profound unpredictability and the volatile nature of Iraqi politics allow for a small possibility of a dramatic, last-minute deal that could include an extension or bending of IHEC rules, however improbable. This 10% probability reflects a low-likelihood, high-impact scenario, but I now believe the overwhelming likelihood is that the deadline will pass without Sadr's Alliance registering.",
