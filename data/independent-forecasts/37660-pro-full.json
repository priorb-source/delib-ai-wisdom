  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Starlink has been granted a license to operate in Sri Lanka, but the service launch is on hold pending the resolution of regulatory and national security requirements. Starlink's official map does not currently show availability in Sri Lanka.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Starlink and the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry regarding national security requirements, such as data interception, prove to be complex and are not resolved. Bureaucratic delays in implementing a required 'dashboard system' also persist, preventing the service from launching and the map from being updated before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sri Lankan government and Starlink reach a swift agreement on the outstanding security and regulatory issues in late May or June 2025. This resolution is expedited by political will, allowing Starlink to officially launch the service and update its availability map to 'Available' for Sri Lanka before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 40%. This is based on conflicting evidence within a short timeframe. On the one hand, Starlink secured its license in August 2024, has had tariff plans approved by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), and the TRCSL itself expected an April 2025 launch. This indicates significant progress and regulatory support. However, this optimism is countered by a major obstacle: a government hold on the service, reported in late March 2025, pending the resolution of national security concerns, which were at a 'preliminary' stage of discussion. The fact that the April 2025 launch target was missed is a strong signal that this is a serious and time-consuming issue. Such security negotiations are often protracted, as seen with Starlink's delays in Pakistan. The status quo is a delay, and with only about six weeks remaining, this is the most likely outcome to persist. My probability is not lower because the foundational licensing and approvals are complete, meaning a political decision could break the impasse quickly. It is not higher because security ministries rarely move fast or compromise on their demands, making a resolution before July 1 less likely than not.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
