  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days). The forecast is made on May 20, 2025, and the outcome will be known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The CDC's recommendation for 0.7 mg/L fluoride remains in place on its website, and the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Under intense political pressure from the HHS Secretary, the CDC director takes an accelerated action. Before July 1, 2025, the CDC either pulls the recommendation page offline or issues an interim statement withdrawing the 0.7 mg/L recommendation pending the outcome of the new review.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The review process initiated by HHS, which involves convening the Community Preventive Services Task Force, follows a standard, deliberate timeline. This process is not completed by July 1, 2025, and the existing recommendation on the CDC website remains unchanged while the review is ongoing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong precedent for bureaucratic inertia in federal public health agencies, balanced against significant, high-level political pressure for change. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the extremely short timeline. The last update to this recommendation took four years to complete; changing it in under seven weeks is highly improbable through any standard scientific review process. The Community Preventive Services Task Force must be convened, review evidence, and issue a formal recommendation, a process that almost certainly extends far beyond July 1, 2025. In the absence of a new recommendation, the existing one will stand. However, the probability is not higher because there is a non-trivial risk of a rapid, politically-driven action. The research report notes that the HHS Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has explicitly directed the CDC to stop the recommendation. This creates a plausible scenario where the CDC takes an immediate, interim step—such as removing the webpage or issuing a withdrawal notice—to comply with the Secretary's directive while the formal review is pending. The coordinated actions at the EPA and FDA suggest this is a serious, administration-wide effort. My forecast is not lower than 85% because such direct political interference in a long-standing scientific public health recommendation would be a significant action, and institutional resistance and procedural requirements make the status quo the most likely outcome over this short period. I would increase my forecast towards 'Yes' if HHS or CDC issued a statement confirming the current guidance will remain during the review. I would decrease it significantly if there were credible reports or leaks indicating an interim withdrawal or page takedown was imminent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
