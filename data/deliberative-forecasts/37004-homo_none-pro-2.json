    "review": "There is a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all ground our high-confidence forecasts in the same core evidence: the Conservative Party's large, consistent, and long-standing double-digit lead in public opinion polls, driven by voter frustration with economic issues like inflation and housing. We also agree on the primary sources of uncertainty that prevent a near-certain forecast: the election campaign has not yet started, leaving room for shifts, and the potential for unforeseen events to alter the political landscape. Forecaster 3 helpfully specified a 'Liberal leadership change' as a key potential event, which crystallizes a significant, albeit low-probability, path to a 'No' outcome. The reasoning from both forecasters is convincing and aligns almost perfectly with my own initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. The deliberation has reinforced my conviction in my initial assessment rather than changed it. The arguments presented by Forecasters 2 and 3 are substantively identical to my own, confirming that the key variables have been correctly identified. We all agree on the overwhelming weight of the polling data favoring a Conservative popular vote win. We also agree on the nature of the remaining uncertainty. While Forecaster 3 is slightly more bullish at 88%, their own reasoning—including the specific risk of a Liberal leadership change altering the dynamic—persuades me that my slightly more cautious 85% is appropriate. This level of probability correctly reflects the dominant likelihood of a Conservative win while still assigning a meaningful 15% chance to the potential for a significant shift during a campaign or due to a major event.",
