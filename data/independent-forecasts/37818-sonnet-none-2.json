    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025 when Metaculus accesses the National UFO Reporting Center data for June 2025. That is approximately 41 days from today (May 21, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Florida does not have the most pilot UFO sightings",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A state with higher aviation traffic volume like California or Texas has more pilot sightings in June 2025, or Florida ties with another state for the most sightings (which counts as No), or sightings are distributed across multiple states without Florida achieving a clear lead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida has strictly more pilot UFO sightings than any other state in June 2025, possibly due to a notable UAP event in Florida airspace, Florida's high commercial and military aviation activity generating more pilot reports, or favorable weather conditions leading to more flight operations and observation opportunities.",
    "rationale": "Note: The question title mentions March 2025 but the resolution criteria specifies June 2025. Since today is May 21, 2025, I'm forecasting based on June 2025 per the resolution criteria. Without historical data on pilot UFO sightings by state, I must rely on base rates and structural factors. With 50 US states, a uniform baseline would give each state a 2% chance. However, Florida has several advantages: it's the 3rd most populous state, has significant aviation activity (major airports in Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale), substantial military aviation presence, year-round flight operations due to favorable weather, and extensive coastal/peninsula airspace. These factors should elevate Florida above the baseline. However, competing states also have strong profiles: California has the most aviation traffic nationally, Texas is geographically larger with significant aviation, and states with major aviation hubs like New York and Illinois are also contenders. The question requires PILOT sightings specifically, which favors states with high aviation activity rather than just population. The requirement that Florida must have strictly more sightings (ties count as No) adds another constraint. My forecast is not higher because: I lack historical data showing Florida typically leads in this metric, many other states have comparable or superior aviation activity, and random monthly variation could favor any state. My forecast is not lower because: Florida's combination of population, aviation activity, and geography makes it a genuine contender above the 2% baseline. I would update higher if I learned Florida historically leads in pilot UFO reports, or if there were reports of unusual activity in Florida airspace in early June. I would update lower if historical data showed Florida rarely places first, or if other states had significantly more aviation activity than I estimated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
