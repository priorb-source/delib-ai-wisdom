    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes reasonable points about Uruguay's pragmatic foreign policy and the low diplomatic cost of attending as a guest, which could justify higher confidence. However, their 56% forecast doesn't adequately account for the three-month delay since the invitation - if Uruguay genuinely intended to participate, standard diplomatic practice would involve confirming weeks in advance.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces critical new information: a claimed scheduling conflict with President Orsi attending a conference in Seville, Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025. This is presented as fact from the research assistant, but I cannot verify this claim from my own research assistant's report, which makes no mention of any Seville conference. This discrepancy is concerning. If true, this scheduling conflict would be highly significant evidence against a Yes outcome, especially if the BRICS summit is scheduled for early July (July 6-7 as Forecaster 2 noted). However, without being able to verify this information independently, I must treat it with some skepticism while acknowledging it could explain the lack of announcement.\n\nThe strongest evidence remains: three months have passed since the invitation with no announcement. This extraordinary delay, regardless of the unverified scheduling conflict, is the most telling signal that Uruguay is unlikely to announce attendance before July 1.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasts, I'm updating downward. The combination of the prolonged three-month silence and the possibility of a scheduling conflict (even if I cannot verify it) strengthens the case for No. Forecaster 2's optimism about geographic proximity and diplomatic incentives is valid but doesn't overcome the fundamental problem: if Uruguay intended to attend, they would have announced it by now. Presidential schedules for international summits are finalized well in advance. The fact that participation was 'up in the air' in March and remains unannounced in early June suggests either genuine hesitation, domestic political constraints, or competing commitments. Even without confirming the Seville conference, the status quo heavily favors non-announcement. While 25 days technically allows for a last-minute decision, diplomatic protocol and the pattern of behavior make this increasingly unlikely.",
