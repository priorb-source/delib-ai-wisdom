    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that expose weaknesses in my original analysis. Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I significantly underweighted: the naming/reporting specificity requirement. The resolution requires human cases specifically attributed to 'HKU5-CoV-2' by credible sources like WHO/CDC, not just any novel coronavirus. This adds a substantial bureaucratic and scientific hurdle - even if a spillover occurred, it might be reported as 'novel coronavirus' or 'unidentified coronavirus' before specific HKU5-CoV-2 designation is officially adopted. Forecaster 2 effectively articulates the multiplicative nature of the required chain of events: spillover must occur, be detected, correctly sequenced, AND officially reported with correct designation - all within 6 weeks. Each step is a filter reducing probability. Both forecasters independently converged on 2%, suggesting my 9% significantly overestimated the likelihood. I gave too much weight to weak reasoning ('question existence implies concern') and insufficient weight to: (1) the cumulative effect of multiple sequential low-probability requirements, (2) the bureaucratic timeline for official designation, and (3) the specificity of the resolution criteria. The arguments for 2-3% are substantially more rigorous than my original reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am convinced I overestimated this probability. The key insight is that the resolution requires not just a spillover event, but a complete chain: infection → detection → sequencing → official reporting by WHO/CDC with the specific HKU5-CoV-2 designation, all within 6.5 weeks. The naming specificity is particularly important - conservative international health bodies may not immediately use a specific viral designation even if a novel coronavirus case is identified. My original 9% was based partly on weak heuristics (question existence) rather than rigorous sequential probability analysis. The base rate for any given novel bat coronavirus causing documented human infection in a 6-week window is extremely low (well under 1%). Even with enhanced post-COVID surveillance, the detection-to-official-reporting pipeline takes time. However, I don't want to fully anchor to the 2% consensus. Some non-negligible tail risk remains: the virus may have been flagged due to specific risk factors, there could be ongoing unreported investigations, or intensified targeted surveillance. I'm updating significantly downward to 3%, acknowledging the strong arguments while preserving slightly more probability mass for scenarios we might collectively be underweighting.",
