    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days (from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No deportation occurs. The legal challenge to detention continues through the court system, extending beyond the July 1 deadline. Immigration proceedings and appeals typically take months to years to resolve, making the status quo outcome that Khalil remains in the United States.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Khalil's legal challenge to his detention succeeds or causes significant delays. The court grants stays, requires additional hearings, or the case gets delayed due to administrative or procedural requirements. Even if deportation is eventually ordered, the execution of that order takes longer than 48 days to complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Khalil's legal challenge is quickly dismissed or denied within the next few weeks. All appeals are exhausted or denied expeditiously. Immigration authorities then move swiftly to execute the deportation order, physically removing Khalil from US territory before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "With only 48 days remaining until the deadline, this is a very short window for a contested deportation to occur. The question background indicates that Khalil's challenge to his detention is 'moving forward,' suggesting active litigation. Several factors point toward a low probability: (1) Immigration cases with legal challenges typically take months or years to resolve, not weeks; (2) Even with a deportation order in place, the administrative process of actually executing deportation often takes considerable time; (3) Courts often grant stays and procedural delays in detention cases; (4) No information suggests imminent deportation or that legal challenges have failed. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) 48 days is theoretically enough time if all legal challenges fail immediately and authorities act quickly; (2) Some deportations do occur on expedited timelines in certain circumstances; (3) We lack detailed information about the current status of the case. Applying appropriate weight to the status quo (which strongly favors continued legal proceedings), and absent any information suggesting imminent deportation, the probability should be low. I would revise upward with news of legal challenge dismissal or deportation order execution beginning. I would revise downward with court-granted stays or successful legal motions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
