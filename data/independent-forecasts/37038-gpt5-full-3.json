  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS already shows +17% for Israel (currently marked “suspended”), and suspension status does not affect resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Before June 1, the administration finalizes a new US–Israel trade arrangement or issues a proclamation/USTR action that rescinds or revises HTS 9903.01.48, and USITC updates the HTS so Israel no longer shows +17% (e.g., returns to 0% under the FTA or a different rate).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No formal change is made before June 1, so HTS continues to list +17% for Israel under 9903.01.48 (still shown as suspended).",
    "rationale": "Summary of evidence: The US announced a 17% “reciprocal” tariff on Israeli goods (HTS 9903.01.48), effective April 9, 2025, then suspended its collection for 90 days (until July 9). The official HTS site reportedly already shows “+17%” for Israel with a “suspended” notation. The question resolves Yes if the HTS lists +17% for Israel on or after June 1, regardless of suspension.\n\nWhy the base case favors Yes: • The 90‑day suspension runs past June 1, so there is no operational need to remove the line before then. • Trade policy changes typically occur on the announced review/expiration date rather than mid‑suspension, unless a new deal is finalized. • The resolution explicitly counts a suspended listing as Yes, and the listing is already present.\n\nReasons for caution (downside to Yes): • Israeli officials and the US reportedly aim to reach a new agreement before the suspension expires, and five-plus weeks remain until June 1. • If a deal is struck quickly, the White House/USTR could issue a proclamation or notice rescinding or modifying 9903.01.48, and USITC can update the HTS rapidly. • Political optics around US–Israel trade could motivate an earlier rollback.\n\nWhy not higher: A credible, early bilateral deal is plausible; if finalized in May, the HTS could be updated before June 1, eliminating the +17% listing. Why not lower: The status quo already satisfies the resolution; removal requires proactive action and procedural updates, and leverage considerations suggest maintaining the listing through the suspension window.\n\nWhat would move me up: • Signals that talks have stalled or that the US plans to keep leverage through July 9. • No Federal Register/USTR movement by mid‑ to late‑May. • Explicit USITC/HTS notes retaining or extending the listing. What would move me down: • Reports of a finalized US–Israel agreement with immediate tariff restoration to 0% or another specified rate. • A USTR press release, Federal Register notice, or presidential proclamation rescinding/modifying 9903.01.48 effective before June 1. • USITC advance posting of HTS revisions removing the +17% line.",
