  "information": "Major financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut before July 1, 2025. The Fed maintains current rates through any June FOMC meeting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economy continues showing stability with strong employment data. The Fed holds rates steady at its June FOMC meeting, maintaining its cautious approach given persistent inflation concerns. The first rate cut occurs at the July FOMC meeting or later, as major forecasters currently project.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected economic deterioration occurs in late May or June - such as a significant banking crisis, sharp decline in employment, or financial market disruption - prompting either an emergency rate cut or a decision to cut rates at the June FOMC meeting before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests a No outcome. We are in mid-May 2025 with less than 7 weeks remaining. Multiple major financial institutions have recently PUSHED BACK their rate cut forecasts: Goldman Sachs now expects December 2025 (previously July), Bank of America shifted to July (from June), Morgan Stanley expects July, and the Bloomberg economist consensus moved from May to July. This backwards movement in expectations is significant - forecasters are becoming less confident in early cuts, not more. The Fed recently paused rate cuts following stronger-than-expected jobs data and a stable economy, indicating no urgency to ease policy. For a Yes outcome to occur, we would need either an emergency rate cut (rare and typically reserved for crises) or a surprise cut at the June FOMC meeting. The recent strong economic data and unanimous forecaster consensus for July or later makes this unlikely. Why not lower: There is still time for 1-2 meetings before July 1, and unexpected economic shocks or financial crises could force emergency action. Markets can deteriorate rapidly. Why not higher: The overwhelming consensus points to July or later, recent data is strong, the Fed just paused showing no immediate plans, and importantly, the trend has been away from early cuts. With all major institutions forecasting July or later and strong recent economic signals, the baseline expectation is firmly for No.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
