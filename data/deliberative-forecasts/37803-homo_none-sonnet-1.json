    "review": "The other forecasters raise a critical point I underweighted: Forecaster 3 notes the site has been down since early February 2025, meaning it's been offline for over 3 months, not just the 2+ weeks I had implicitly considered. This is significant evidence of entrenchment. The longer a site remains down without restoration signals, the more likely the decision is deliberate and resistant to change. All three of us converge on similar logic: the status quo strongly favors remaining down due to Trump administration climate policy, bureaucratic inertia, and lack of restoration signals, but military operational needs and 6 weeks of remaining time provide some non-zero probability. The main disagreement is in degree. Forecaster 3's identification of the February timeline is the most important new information - it suggests this isn't a recent decision that might be quickly reversed, but rather a months-long status quo.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating downward based on the 3+ month downtime information. When a site has been deliberately taken down and remains offline for over 3 months without any reported restoration efforts, legal challenges, or military pushback becoming public, this suggests the decision is more entrenched than I initially weighted. The longer timeline increases the likelihood that: (1) there's no active internal effort to restore it, (2) any military concerns have already been overridden or worked around, and (3) the administration's position is firm. However, I'm not going as low as 20% because I still find the military operational rationale compelling - climate resilience genuinely affects base planning, Arctic operations, and strategic readiness. Six weeks remains sufficient time for unexpected developments like congressional action, legal intervention, or a shift in military leadership priorities. The military has historically shown some independence on operational matters. My updated forecast of 24% acknowledges the significance of the 3-month downtime while maintaining that the combination of military necessity and remaining time prevents this from being a near-certainty of staying down.",
