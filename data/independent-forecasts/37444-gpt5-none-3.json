    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (roughly 55–56 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN List on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Administration debates but ultimately delays action amid political pushback and legal/coordination hurdles; OFAC takes no delisting action, so Nord Stream 2 AG still appears in the OFAC Sanctions List Search on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House decides to ease sanctions on select Russian energy assets and directs Treasury/State to delist Nord Stream 2 AG (or otherwise remove it from the SDN List) before July 1, issuing an OFAC notice and updating the Sanctions List Search accordingly.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, the baseline is that SDN listings persist, and delistings—especially on high‑salience Russia matters—are politically costly. Nord Stream 2 AG has been on the SDN List since 2022; the pipeline is damaged and non‑operational, so the immediate economic upside of delisting is limited, reducing the incentive to spend political capital quickly. Even if the Administration is debating relief (per the April 23 Politico report), moving from internal debate to an OFAC delisting within ~2 months requires interagency alignment, potential consultations with allies (notably Germany/EU), and navigating strong bipartisan sanctions sentiment in Congress. Congress could also act to deter or reverse a delisting, adding perceived risk. Moreover, waivers or general licenses would not necessarily remove the entity from the SDN List; this question resolves on whether Nord Stream 2 AG disappears from the OFAC search, which generally requires a formal delisting. These factors favor the status quo. Why not higher: The combination of short timeline, ongoing Russia–Ukraine hostilities, and likely congressional resistance make a pre–July 1 delisting unlikely. Why not lower: The Politico report indicates active consideration by the White House, and there is executive authority to delist or waive certain sanctions; a decision could be packaged within a broader diplomatic or energy policy move, so a small but real chance remains. What would move me up: Credible reporting of an imminent OFAC delisting action; a public White House/Treasury statement signaling specific intent and timeline; evidence of EU/German coordination supporting delisting; signs Congress will not oppose. What would move me down: Clear statements from senior officials ruling out delisting; new Russian escalations increasing political cost; congressional moves to preemptively block relief. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the Politico item, so I place extra weight on inertia and process timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
