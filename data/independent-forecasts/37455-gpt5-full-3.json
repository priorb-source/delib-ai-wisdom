  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today Lesotho does not show as Available on Starlink’s map, and if nothing changes it will remain No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license, Starlink delays enabling orders/map availability due to logistics (import path via South Africa), device type-approval/ customs/ tax setup, or to avoid cross‑border misuse while South Africa remains unlicensed; the map stays at Coming Soon past June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink flips Lesotho to Available in a batch of African updates, enables address-based ordering with geofencing to Lesotho, and the map shows Available for at least part of the country before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and base rates:\n- Lesotho granted a 10‑year operating license on Apr 14, 2025 (RA). In other African markets, Starlink has sometimes moved from license to availability within days (e.g., DRC license ~May 3–5, availability announced by May 5, RA). That shows a capability and willingness to update the availability map quickly once regulatory boxes are checked.\n- Offsetting factors: Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not licensed. That can complicate shipping (landlocked, most freight transits South Africa) and may heighten concerns about cross‑border gray use. Starlink can geofence, but operational caution could slow a flip to Available. Lesotho’s small market may also lower priority relative to DRC/Somalia and other larger launches.\n- The website criterion is modest: the map just needs to show Available; it doesn’t require broad service adoption. SpaceX often updates the map concurrently with opening orders. With ~54 days left, there are multiple weekly windows for a batch update that includes Lesotho.\n- Status quo weighting: Today it’s not available. If nothing else happens, the outcome is No. However, the fresh license materially shifts the prior toward a change within weeks, given recent Africa rollout pace and Starlink’s maturing laser backhaul (reducing dependence on local ground stations).\nWhy not higher: Uncertainties around import/logistics via South Africa, possible remaining device/type approvals or tax/billing setup, and potential regional regulatory sensitivity could push availability to later in 2025.\nWhy not lower: A full national license and a local entity (Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd) indicate readiness; recent precedent (DRC) shows rapid post‑license activation; geofencing mitigates South Africa spillover risks, so a map flip does not require SA licensing.\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of Starlink enabling orders to Lesotho addresses; LCA/type‑approval confirmation for user terminals; Starlink/X posts or regional PR indicating imminent Lesotho launch; reseller/distributor announcements; Starlink map updates rolling out to nearby newly licensed countries.\nWhat would move me down: Reports of customs/ import bottlenecks via South Africa; explicit statements that commercial operations await additional approvals; prolonged silence while other countries flip; the Starlink map labeling Lesotho as Coming Soon with a ETA beyond July.\nSummary of RA info used: License granted Apr 14; rapid DRC turnaround in early May; Somalia license in April; South Africa remains unlicensed; Zimbabwe enforcement shows geofencing/regulatory sensitivity. These collectively support a moderate‑to‑high chance of a map update by July 1, but not a lock.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
