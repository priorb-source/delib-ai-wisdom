    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, concrete OSINT anchors I hadn’t explicitly cited: 38 North reporting no last‑mile preparations at Punggye‑ri, and a reminder of historical timing (tests clustering in Jan/Feb and September, with only one late‑spring test). They also list specific 2025 conventional/missile events that show continued signaling below the nuclear threshold. I find their reasoning largely convincing: feasibility remains, but the short window plus lack of proximate indicators argues for a modest probability. The seasonality point is a weak prior but directionally consistent. The IAEA/NIS assessments of capability do not change the near‑term outlook without corroborating site activity. Net, their inputs moderately strengthen the case to shade my estimate down.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about two months. Since the last test in 2017, repeated “imminent” windows have not materialized, and there are currently no credible public signs of last‑mile prep at Punggye‑ri (power/cabling, dewatering, logistics), which historically tend to surface ahead of a test. Capability is intact and leadership rhetoric is escalatory, but DPRK has consistently preferred sub‑nuclear demonstrations (missiles, cruise systems, naval platforms, satellites) to manage costs—especially given likely Chinese disapproval even amid deepened Russia ties. Key dates like June 25 marginally elevate risk but not enough to outweigh the absence of preparatory indicators and the very short horizon. Incorporating the others’ points, I’m revising down slightly from 14% to 10%. I would move up quickly on credible satellite imagery or allied intel flagging imminent preparations; I would move down further if continued imagery shows dormancy or if there are signs of Chinese pressure constraining a test.",
