  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current political alignment holds. Strong opposition from key cabinet members like Secretary of State Rubio, coupled with a bipartisan push in Congress to increase pressure on Russia, ensures that the sanctions on NORD STREAM 2 AG remain in place. The EU's lack of interest in the pipeline's revival further solidifies the US position. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes with no change in policy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and dramatic breakthrough in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine occurs. As a key part of a 'grand bargain' championed by Special Envoy Wietkoff and ultimately approved by President Trump, the US agrees to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as a major concession to Russia in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and other strategic gains. This policy reversal happens rapidly, overriding domestic and allied objections.",
    "rationale": "The probability of the US lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG before July 1, 2025, is extremely low. My forecast heavily weights the status quo, which is that the sanctions will remain. The primary evidence supporting this conclusion is the strong, public opposition from key administration officials, including a direct and 'unequivocal' denial from the Secretary of State. Furthermore, the political momentum in Congress is moving in the opposite direction, toward expanding, not easing, sanctions on Russia. The US's European allies have also shown no interest in reviving the pipeline, meaning a US reversal would be diplomatically isolating. Finally, the short timeframe of less than two months makes such a significant and controversial policy shift highly improbable. The pipeline's physical damage and legal troubles in Europe also reduce any practical urgency to lift the sanctions. The forecast is not lower than 2% because the Politico report suggests the topic has at least been broached within the administration, and a sudden, unexpected foreign policy deal, while unlikely, cannot be completely ruled out. The forecast is not higher because the political, diplomatic, and legislative barriers are currently substantial and show no signs of weakening. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of high-level US-Russia talks where Nord Stream 2 sanctions were a confirmed bargaining chip. I would decrease it if the proposed bipartisan bill to expand sanctions passes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
