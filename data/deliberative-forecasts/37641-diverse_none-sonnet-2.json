    "review": "Both forecasters converge on 65%, significantly higher than my initial 35%. They make several compelling arguments I underweighted: (1) Forecaster 3 correctly notes that 7 weeks is actually sufficient for late-stage IPOs to complete the roadshow-pricing-listing sequence, suggesting I overestimated timeline constraints; (2) Both interpret the Forbes article's strong language ('The Circle IPO Solidifies...') as indicating Circle is in final stages rather than early planning, which is a reasonable reading of financial journalism norms; (3) Forecaster 3's point about base rates for companies with public filings is well-taken - if Circle has already filed, 1-2 months to completion is realistic. However, I'm concerned both forecasters may be overweighting a single 5-week-old article. The research assistant found 'no additional information available,' which is somewhat bearish - if Circle were truly on track for a June listing from a late-stage position in early April, we would likely have seen concrete updates by now (roadshow announcements, pricing ranges, SEC effectiveness, etc.). The information vacuum since April 4 suggests either: (a) the IPO process is stalled/delayed, or (b) it's progressing quietly but not as imminently as the Forbes headline suggested. Their base rate reasoning assumes Circle has already filed publicly, but we don't have confirmation of this.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining more cautious than the other forecasters. I was likely too pessimistic about timeline feasibility - 7 weeks can accommodate a late-stage IPO. The Forbes article is a stronger signal than I initially credited, as financial media typically doesn't publish such definitive headlines without substantial evidence of momentum. However, I maintain concern about the 40-day information gap. If Circle had filed an S-1 by early April and were tracking toward June, we would expect to see: SEC effectiveness announcements, roadshow scheduling, pricing range updates, or analyst coverage initiating. The absence of these milestones in our available information suggests either the process is less advanced than the Forbes article implied, or unexpected delays have occurred. I'm splitting the difference: acknowledging the other forecasters' valid points about feasibility and signal strength, while maintaining appropriate skepticism given the lack of concrete recent progress indicators. My updated forecast reflects meaningful upward revision from 35% but remains below their 65% consensus.",
